"For decades, Allen Weisselberg operated in the shadows of the Trump Organization, a trusted executive so hidden from public view that one former colleague described him as a “ghost man.”

Now the 71-year-old chief financial officer and loyal confidant of President Trump has been thrust into the spotlight, drawn into legal matters swirling around Mr. Trump.

As treasurer of the Trump Foundation, Mr. Weisselberg was cited in a civil suit filed in June by the New York Attorney General’s office, alleging that the charity engaged in self-dealing, though he wasn’t a defendant and hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing. The foundation is fighting the lawsuit, saying it is without merit.

Mr. Weisselberg has been subpoenaed to testify as a witness before a federal grand jury as part of an investigation into the activities of Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen, people familiar with the matter say. Mr. Cohen hasn’t been charged, and has denied wrongdoing.

Mr. Weisselberg also has been linked to hush payments to two women who allegedly had sex with Mr. Trump, deals that are under scrutiny in that investigation. Mr. Trump has denied having sex with the women.

With his deep knowledge of Mr. Trump’s personal finance and business dealings, including throughout his presidential campaign, Mr. Weisselberg could be a critical resource for investigators in these legal matters, people familiar with the matter say.

Mr. Weisselberg didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment on this article. A lawyer representing him didn’t respond to a request for comment. The Trump Organization didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The bespectacled Mr. Weisselberg has been little known outside of Mr. Trump’s core inner circle at the Trump Organization.

But within that circle, he has long been a central figure in Mr. Trump’s business and foundation work. That role expanded after the election, when Mr. Trump handed him, alongside Mr. Trump’s adult sons, control of his financial interests.

Mr. Weisselberg also had involvement in Mr. Trump’s political life, such as fielding questions from Trump administration officials about the status of surplus inaugural funds, according to people familiar with the matter.

Mr. Weisselberg could at times play hardball. In 2007, he was alleged to have tried to get a law firm’s bill cut in half after a clerical error in which the Trump Organization inadvertently received a bill from the firm that was intended for another client.

He threatened to inform the other client of the error unless the law firm agreed to a 50% discount on legal bills, according to a letter filed in a New York state court written by attorney David Piedra at the law firm, Morrison Cohen.

“Mr. Weisselberg stated that he is holding the page in his drawer until he receives our firm’s response to his demand,” Mr. Piedra wrote, saying that the move “smacks of extortion.”

The Trump Organization disputed its bill from Morrison Cohen in an ensuing legal dispute between the two firms, which was settled and terms weren’t made public. Mr. Weisselberg and his lawyer didn’t respond to requests for comment on the incident. The Trump Organization didn’t respond to a request for comment. Morrison Cohen declined to comment.

His name also emerged in the pending suit by the New York attorney general, which alleged a “pattern of illegal conduct” by the Donald J. Trump Foundation, including self-dealing transactions to benefit Mr. Trump’s personal and business interests and improper coordination with his presidential campaign.

State investigators said in court papers that the Trump Organization accounting staff, including Mr. Weisselberg, administered the foundation’s charitable assets without supervision or training, according to the “whim” of Mr. Trump.

Leading up to the 2016 election, the foundation was “co-opted” by the Trump campaign, the suit alleged, violating state and federal laws governing charities’ engagements in political activity and related transactions.

In a January 2016 email exchange cited in the complaint, Mr. Weisselberg corresponded with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski about disbursing donations received during a fundraiser for veterans, which the lawsuit alleges was improperly directed by the campaign with administrative assistance from the foundation.

In testimony quoted in the suit, Mr. Weisselberg said he didn’t know what Mr. Lewandowski wanted with the money. “I had nothing to do with the political side of anything,” he told investigators, according to court papers. “I just wanted to get checks prepared.”

Related Video A secretive grand jury of anonymous Americans is playing a key role in the Russia investigation. WSJ's Shelby Holliday explains.

A Trump Organization spokeswoman has called the suit “politics at its very worst.” The organization didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Weisselberg hasn’t commented publicly on the suit. Mr. Lewandowski didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Meantime, Mr. Weisselberg arranged for the Trump Organization to pay Mr. Cohen after Mr. Cohen made an October 2016 payment of $130,000 to former adult-film star who had alleged that she had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.

A person familiar with Mr. Weisselberg’s thinking said he didn’t know about the payment when he agreed to a $35,000 monthly retainer for Mr. Cohen in January 2017.

Mr. Weisselberg also surfaced in a tape Mr. Cohen secretly made during a September 2016 meeting with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen spoke with his boss about buying the rights to a former Playboy model’s story of an affair with Mr. Trump, according to the recording, which is under review by federal prosecutors.

Mr. Cohen said he planned to set up a company to pay, adding “I’ve spoken with Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up.” Mr. Cohen created a shell company that month to make the payment, The Journal has reported.

It isn’t clear if Mr. Cohen actually spoke with Mr. Weisselberg about this payment, which never was made.

"President Trump’s detractors see White House counsel Don McGahn’s cooperation with special counsel Robert Mueller as a breakthrough in Mr. Mueller’s investigation. From personal experience, I see it as further evidence that the president and his advisers have concluded Mr. Trump has done nothing wrong and has nothing to hide.

I was White House counsel during the Iran-Contra affair, a case in which President Reagan was accused of the unauthorized use of government funds, illegally selling weapons to Iran, trading arms for hostages in violation of longstanding U.S. policies, an illegal coverup, and misleading Congress and the American people. These charges were pressed eagerly by the media and committees of Congress, which was fully controlled by Democrats beginning in 1987. As today, the media—led by the New York Times, the Washington Post and CNN—and Democrats in Congress hoped to bring about the impeachment of a Republican president.

In writing my book about the Reagan presidency, I counted the number of articles about Iran-Contra in the Times and the Post between Nov. 6, 1986, when the scandal became public, and Jan. 31, 1987, when I got tired of counting. In that three-month period, there were 555 stories in the Post and 505 in the Times, an average of more than five a day in each paper. If you think the media frenzy of today is unprecedented, think again.

Under the law in 1986, an “independent counsel” could be appointed by a special panel of appellate-court judges. Lawrence Walsh, a former prosecutor, took the job. He did not issue his report until 1993, more than six years after his appointment. But Iran-Contra fizzled as a major public issue once it became clear that the president was not guilty of anything and was not going to be impeached.

From the outset, it was clear to me that Reagan was innocent of any wrongdoing. He certainly had approved the sale of arms to Iran—which he had publicly acknowledged as his policy. But he refused to admit that he had intended to trade arms for the American hostages that were then held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, the jihadist organization that is still an ally and dependency of Iran. Even if it was a trade, it was well within the president’s powers and not illegal.

The responsible parties, it soon became clear, were Oliver North, then a Marine lieutenant colonel on the staff of the National Security Council, and John Poindexter, the president’s national security adviser. Having received the president’s authority to ship arms to Iran, they had used the proceeds to support the Contras, a rebel group fighting the communist government of Nicaragua.

The misuse of the proceeds of the arms sales—funds that belonged to the U.S.—probably would have been an impeachable offense. Yet it was clear from my discussions with Reagan and his chief of staff, Donald Regan, that neither knew of what had come to be called the “diversion of funds to the Contras.” Many months later, when Mr. Poindexter finally testified to Congress, he said that he had authorized the diversion and not told the president. Until that statement, there remained hope among Reagan’s opponents that he would be found responsible and ultimately impeached.

Having concluded at the outset of the scandal that there was no legal jeopardy for the president, I authorized, in my capacity as White House counsel, cooperation with the congressional investigating committees and the independent counsel. I also met with and testified to the independent counsel. The release of all relevant documents by the White House and the Defense and State departments was probably the reason for the enormous number of press articles. Any document that suggested a problem for the president was immediately leaked and set off more rumors and imputations from unnamed sources about his presumed guilt and impeachment jeopardy.

The price for this was a terrible year for the president and all of us in the White House. Yet Reagan left office at the end of eight years having accomplished what he intended when he took the job—and with positive approval ratings that improved over time.

All this throws some light on Mr. McGahn’s cooperation with Mr. Mueller’s investigation. It seems to be part of a sensible White House strategy when the president is not guilty of wrongdoing. In politics, the coverup is often worse than the crime. If Mr. Trump’s advisers have concluded that he is innocent, it makes a great deal of sense to be as open as possible with all investigations, even if the result is a media frenzy. It also supports the argument that Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s private lawyer, is currently making: There is no need for the president himself to meet with Mr. Mueller.

The president has hurt himself by constantly attacking the Mueller investigation. He should be going about his presidential business and simply ignoring the media’s fascination with the issue. Nevertheless, he apparently has authorized the release of millions of documents and permitted interviews with a large number of White House staff members. It is in that context that the McGahn interviews occurred, and they are likely to have occurred long ago, since Mr. McGahn was clearly a key witness to the president’s intentions and would have been among the first to be called for an interview.

None of this proves that the president is innocent, but it would be an incomprehensible strategy if he is not.

"WASHINGTON—Don McGahn, the top attorney in the White House, will leave his post in the coming months after the Senate vote on President Trump’s second Supreme Court nominee.

Mr. McGahn, the White House counsel, would be the latest among Mr. Trump’s senior aides to depart, and also the one most closely associated with the special counsel’s Russia investigation that has ensnared several of his former colleagues.

He will leave the White House in the fall, Mr. Trump announced in a Twitter post on Wednesday.

Mr. McGahn, who was also chief counsel for Mr. Trump’s campaign, had discussed his departure with the president earlier this year, but was surprised by the tweet, as were several other senior White House aides, including chief communications adviser Bill Shine, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Shine declined to comment on Mr. McGahn’s coming departure.

Mr. McGahn’s exit would coincide with the vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a process Mr. McGahn has overseen after shepherding the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch last year.

“Don McGahn’s a really good guy, been with me for a long time,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. “He’s done an excellent job.”

Mr. McGahn’s successor hasn’t been decided, White House officials said, but West Wing officials have long expected the role to be filled by Emmet Flood, a veteran Washington attorney who joined the administration in May.

Mr. McGahn, who pushed for Mr. Flood’s appointment to the White House legal team, has been helping groom Mr. Flood to take over, according to people familiar with the matter.

Some Trump allies are also pushing for Makan Delrahim, the assistant U.S. attorney general for the antitrust division of the Justice Department. Mr. Delrahim, who led the Trump administration’s effort to block AT&T Inc.’s acquisition of Time Warner Inc., is viewed as having more of a political background than Mr. Flood, said one person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Delrahim was staff director and chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee under Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), and he also wrote an opinion piece in the New York Post in 2016 urging Republicans to unite behind Mr. Trump in order to prevent Democrats from filling Supreme Court vacancies.

In the Trump White House, Mr. Flood has focused on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and any possible collusion between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Moscow. The probe has led to the recent conviction of Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and to a guilty plea by Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former White House national security adviser, among other cases. Mr. Trump and Russia have denied any wrongdoing.

Mr. McGahn cooperated extensively with Mr. Mueller’s investigation, sitting for 30 hours of interviews.

Mr. Trump has said he gave Mr. McGahn permission to do so. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he was unconcerned by Mr. McGahn’s cooperation: “We do everything straight, we do everything by the book,” he said.

Mr. Flood, a former partner at Williams & Connolly LLP known as a skilled criminal-defense attorney, is best known for his role representing former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings in the late 1990s.

Mr. Flood also served in the White House counsel’s office under former President George W. Bush, where he handled congressional investigations, including a review of the Bush administration’s controversial firings of seven U.S. attorneys.

Those who know Mr. Flood say he has brought a measured and moderate temperament to Mr. Trump’s legal team.

“People like him,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Wednesday. “He’s super well-respected around the building, but there’s not a plan locked in place at this point.”

News of Mr. McGahn’s departure drew concern from Capitol Hill, including from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who an aide said had no advance notice of the move.

“I hope it’s not true McGahn is leaving WhiteHouse Counsel,” Mr. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, wrote on Twitter. “U can’t let that happen.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Mr. McGahn’s “departure from the White House, whenever that may be, would be a big loss for the Trump administration and the country.”

Newsletter Sign-up

During his time at the White House, Mr. McGahn has overseen the successful confirmation of Justice Gorsuch and has been in charge of the recent nomination of Mr. Kavanaugh. He has also been focused on filling other judicial vacancies and staffing the Justice Department’s legal teams.

Mr. McGahn’s work on judicial appointments has “set an amazing stage” for his successor, said former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. “The president will miss him.”

Mr. McGahn has mused to friends about stepping down, and his battles with Mr. Trump over the Russia investigation and other legal matters, including the president’s initial plan to block immigration from several Muslim-majority countries, often left colleagues with the impression that he was preparing to quit. His plan to leave this fall was first reported by Axios.

Amid rumors of his departure, several of his top aides in the counsel’s office have announced their departures. Uttam Dhillon, a deputy White House counsel, was recently named head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. And Stefan Passantino, the counsel office’s chief ethics attorney, is leaving on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. McGahn’s pending departure leaves just a handful of senior aides in place who joined the Trump White House as top staffers on inauguration day in 2017.

Those include senior advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president’s daughter and son-in-law; Kellyanne Conway and Johnny DeStefano, both counselors to the president; senior adviser Stephen Miller; social media director Dan Scavino; and Deputy Chief of Staff Chris Liddell.

"WASHINGTON—Former colleagues honored Sen. John McCain as he lay in state at the U.S. Capitol on Friday, while members of the public lined up for a chance to pay their respects to the lawmaker.

Mr. McCain (R., Ariz.), a former Republican presidential nominee and war hero who died at age 81 on Saturday, became the 27th named individual to lie in state in the Capitol’s Rotunda room on the day before a memorial service at Washington National Cathedral. (Watch the video feed.)

Congress has also honored with a similar tribute unnamed soldiers from several wars and several private citizens, including civil-rights icon Rosa Parks and Rev. Billy Graham. The last lawmaker to have lain in state was Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii) in 2012.

Sen. John McCain's life will be remembered as one of service to his country. Hear him reflect on his years in the Navy, as a prisoner of war, six-term Senator and presidential nominee.

“Half a world away, wearing our nation’s uniform, John McCain stood up for every value that this Capitol Building represents. Then, he brought that same patriotism inside its walls,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said at Friday’s service, attended by dozens of lawmakers from both political parties. “So it is only right that today, near the end of his long journey, John lies here.”

Military officials carried Mr. McCain’s casket through pouring rain into the Capitol Friday morning, where it was scheduled to remain overnight. After Friday’s ceremony, Mr. McCain’s wife, Cindy, visited his desk in the Senate chamber, which had been draped with a black cloth all week, topped by a vase of white roses. And for hours afterwards, visitors lined up in the intense heat to wait for their chance to witness Mr. McCain’s final hours in the Capitol.

Mr. McCain’s death touched off a wellspring of tributes this week from lawmakers of both parties, who mourned the loss of a senator known for working across the aisle. Former Vice President Joe Biden spoke at his memorial service in Arizona on Thursday and former President Barack Obama, who defeated Mr. McCain in the 2008 presidential race, is expected to deliver remarks at the National Cathedral service on Saturday, as is former President George W. Bush.

Mr. McCain’s death also sparked his final tangle with President Donald Trump, who had criticized Mr. McCain for being captured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and raged against the senator after he voted against the GOP effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The president had resisted praising Mr. McCain for two days, before putting out a statement Monday.

In another controversy, the White House lowered the flag to half-staff on Saturday but then returned it to full-staff on Monday, drawing criticism from lawmakers and veterans groups who said it should remained at half-staff longer. The White House then reversed course and lowered it again, with Mr. Trump issuing a proclamation saying the flag would remain lowered until Sunday.

Vice President Mike Pence said Friday that Mr. Trump had asked him to speak at the ceremony honoring Mr. McCain.

“In my years in Congress and as vice president, we didn’t always agree,” Mr. Pence said. “But his support for limited government, for tax reform and support for our armed forces surely left our nation more prosperous and more secure and he will be missed.”

Arizona’s Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, will choose a replacement for Mr. McCain, who was elected to his sixth term in 2016. His successor would serve for roughly the next two years, with voters choosing a new senator in the 2020 elections.

A spokesman for Mr. Ducey has said any appointment won’t be announced until after Mr. McCain has been laid to rest.

"As a regular visitor to China, I was surprised earlier this year when I heard for the first time a Chinese official refer to his country as a superpower (chaoji daguo). But China’s view of its place in the international order is changing quickly. In a little-noticed speech last month, before a packed house of China’s senior foreign policy officials and scholars, President Xi Jinping put the world on notice: China has its own ideas about how the world should be run and is prepared, as he put it, to “lead in the reform of global governance.”

Gone is the era of Deng Xiaoping, who called China “a large developing country” and insisted that the country maintain a low profile in foreign policy. These days one seldom even hears officials mention the motto of Mr. Xi’s immediate predecessor, Hu Jintao, who described China as “peacefully rising.” Mr. Xi has made clear that he aims to create a new geostrategic landscape.

His ambition is most evident close to home. Where previous Chinese leaders were content to stake claims based on Chinese sovereignty, he has moved to realize them. Through coercion, co-optation and simple brute force, he is making significant strides toward achieving his declared objective of “unifying China” by 2049, the centenary of the founding of the People’s Republic.

In the South China Sea, Mr. Xi has destabilized the region by developing and militarizing seven artificial features, ignoring the competing claims of five other nations and a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague that rejected China’s claims there. In Hong Kong, Beijing has moved to silence contrarian political voices and has worked to disqualify democracy activists from holding office. China is also placing Taiwan in a political chokehold, pressuring other countries to drop their diplomatic recognition of the island nation and forcing multinational corporations to acknowledge Taiwan as part of China.

‘A grand-scale trade and investment plan to revitalize the ancient Silk Road and maritime spice routes.’

But Mr. Xi’s vision of Chinese leadership extends far beyond the country’s own backyard. In 2013 and 2014, he outlined a grand-scale trade and investment plan to revitalize the ancient Silk Road and maritime spice routes, linking China to countries throughout Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa. The Belt and Road Initiative, as it is called, has the potential to help meet the $3 trillion annual deficit in global infrastructure spending: Railroads, ports, pipelines and highways built by Chinese workers and funded by Chinese loans are already connecting countries across six global corridors. The plan now includes a digital component (fiber-optic cables, satellite systems and e-commerce) and a “Polar Silk Road” through the Arctic to connect China to Europe more directly.

China’s development of economic infrastructure has also been accompanied by an expanding Chinese security presence. Beijing established its first military logistics base in Djibouti in 2017, and more bases are likely to follow in other countries. Chinese state-owned companies have assumed control or a controlling stake in at least 76 ports in 35 countries. And despite Beijing’s claims that such ports are only for commercial purposes, Chinese naval ships and submarines have paid visits to several of them.

‘Chinese officials are training their counterparts in how to manage political stability through propaganda.’

Nor has Mr. Xi shied away from exporting elements of China’s political model. In at least eight African countries, as well as some in Southeast Asia and Latin America, Chinese officials are training their counterparts in how to manage political stability through propaganda and how to control media and the internet. Reflecting a degree of confidence rare among recent Chinese leaders, Mr. Xi has even proposed that the China model provides a “new option for other countries who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.”

Less obvious but just as important are Xi Jinping’s efforts to reform global norms and institutions to reflect Chinese values and priorities. In some cases, these efforts are generally supportive of current practices. The China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, for example, models its governance standards on those of the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.

In other instances, however, China uses international institutions to legitimate its own interests. Over the past several years, for example, China has successfully maneuvered to include the Belt and Road Initiative as a formal part of the United Nations’ efforts to achieve its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This comes despite widespread protests in BRI recipient countries in response to China’s weak environmental, labor and governance standards, as well as the crippling debt that many countries are assuming when they undertake such projects.

Finally, Beijing is making significant headway in upending international norms on political and human rights. At the United Nations Human Rights Council, it has worked to diminish the ability of outside actors to criticize a country for human-rights violations. It also promotes a strong vision of internet sovereignty, rejecting data privacy and the free flow of information.

Xi Jinping has proclaimed that China has both the intent and the capability to reshape the international order. Yet much of what passes for Chinese global leadership to date is simply the pursuit of China’s own narrow interests. He has yet to demonstrate the key attributes of true global leadership: the willingness to align and in some cases subordinate Beijing’s immediate interests to the greater global good, and the ability to forge a significant agreement around a global challenge. Where Mr. Xi has claimed leadership—on climate change and globalization, for example—the reality of what China has delivered has fallen far short of the promise.

There is little indication that the rest of the world desires a Chinese-led global order. Polls in countries throughout China’s Asia Pacific neighborhood indicate little confidence in Mr. Xi’s leadership. And fault lines are emerging within China over the appropriate role for the country on the global stage. Though Mr. Xi has used ever more ambitious rhetoric during his tenure, noting last October at the 19th Party Congress, for example, that China has “stood up, grown rich, and become strong,” others resist such language. As an attendee last week at a major foreign policy conference in Beijing, I heard some Chinese officials call for more assertive Chinese leadership, but others suggest that the country has been too ambitious and aggressive and is losing international support as a result.

Yet this emerging debate within China may have little impact. As President Donald Trump raises doubts about the U.S. commitment to global leadership—withdrawing from an ever-increasing number of international agreements and multilateral arrangements—there may be no other choice. Only Xi Jinping appears willing and able to grab the mantle of leadership from a retreating United States. In President Trump’s cultivation of an “America First” agenda, he may well be planting the seeds for a “China First” world.

"Before we come to the insinuations of money laundering, which Steve Bannon believes to be the Trump clan’s real vulnerability in the Mueller investigation, let’s understand that the sticks in U.S.-Russia relations have consisted mostly of NATO expansions and democracy promotion.

The carrots have been mainly economic, understood to include a welcomeness to capital flight that, if we take Russian law more seriously than the Russians do, amounts to an openness to money laundering.

Occasionally there have been flare-ups, as when $10 billion turned up at the Bank of New York after Russia’s 1998 International Monetary Fund bailout. Murders of Putin opponents in London have had to be papered over not just in the interest of banks and real-estate sellers, but because allied governments agreed it was prudent to let Russian oligarchs use Western banks.

Mr. Trump’s participation in this market is unimpressive in perspective. He bought a mansion in Florida out of bankruptcy for $41 million and sold it four years later to a Russian billionaire for $95 million. His son Don Jr. told an audience in 2008, “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia,” presumably related to the family’s condo developments.

Photo: iStock/Getty Images

This, at a time when more than a fifth of all £10 million-plus properties in London were selling to Russians, when Russians were buying up sports teams, factories, even big chunks of Facebook and Twitter .

Mr. Trump failed in his dream to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, probably because local investors were looking for ways to get money out of Russia, not for ways to reinvest it locally while paying extra to put the Trump name on a building.

What about his reliance on Deutsche Bank , whose rogue employee in Moscow (fingered by the bank itself) cost it $630 million last year in money-laundering fines? From one rogue operator in Moscow, it’s a leap to suppose the bank’s wealth-management office in New York made itself a vehicle for illicit Russian loans to the Trump Organization.

Don’t his Russian dealings make President Trump susceptible to blackmail? This idea is grossly exaggerated as well. Think of the KGB files on JFK or Bill Clinton. The trouble the U.S. refrains from making for Vladimir Putin, by not revealing its own files on Russia, attests to a mutually assured destruction that greatly limits this weapon so beloved by conspiracy theorists.

It’s also worth noticing how readily the financial carrot became a stick after the Crimea grab, despite the wailing of Western financiers and developers. Sanctions were imposed on top Russians where it hurt, limiting their access to Western banks. Of special note is a clampdown launched in early 2016 on big-ticket real-estate purchases made with cash, aimed specifically at Manhattan and Miami.

Eyebrows went up at the time. Weren’t these markets near and dear to the Trump Organization? Yet the Trump administration has not only expanded the crackdown but extended it to deals financed by wire transfer.

One lesson is that money-laundering enforcement is inevitably political. For years the U.S. government ignored suspicious-activity reports from U.S. banks related to Mexican officials—until the Mexican government itself in the 1990s signaled it was ready to weather a crackdown.

Mr. Bannon, with his usual knee-deepness, therefore is onto something. Words can be found in statutes to criminalize practically anybody who participates in what the government later decides was a suspicious transaction.

Yes, it would be a grotesque case of selective prosecution to go after a president because he sold condos to rich Russians. Factor in a shrinking approval rate, a Democratic takeover of the House, a GOP no longer keen to defend its president. There was always something profoundly injudicious, in an age of lunatic partisan warfare, about somebody with Mr. Trump’s baggage seeking the White House in the first place, however much Americans like to think even real-estate developers can grow up to be president.

Still, more fruitful would be an honest reassessment of Russia policy since the Soviet collapse. Here’s some news to everyone except the global oligarchs gathered this week in Davos to hear Mr. Trump: It long has been understood that a Western openness to Russian flight capital is a key safety valve of the Putin regime. It props up Russian stability. No local would invest in the local economy if there weren’t a way to get his or her highly stealable winnings off the table. Not for nothing was the 2016 visit by a Russian lawyer to Trump Tower concerned with the U.S. Magnitsky Act, a loaded gun aimed at the Russian elite’s enjoyment of Western financial services.

Even today U.S. policy toward Russia is leavened with a large element of hope-for-the-best because other options aren’t obvious. There has been no effort to shut down Russian energy sales. Sanctions have been pinpricks aimed at getting the attention of Mr. Putin’s billionaire friends. The truth is, whatever his past in Russia, Mr. Trump has little room to reinvent this wheel.",politics

"PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia—Investigators probing the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 found no fault with the pilots or aircraft in Malaysia’s most comprehensive report yet into one of the world’s biggest aviation mysteries.

But they had no explanation for what happened to the plane and the 239 people on board when it vanished about four years ago, and didn’t rule out the possibility of “unlawful interference” of the flight—though no terrorist groups have claimed responsibility.

The report, released Monday by a team that Malaysia’s civil-aviation regulator had appointed, said air-traffic controllers didn’t follow procedures and failed to watch radar displays as required. It said they also delayed activating emergency processes, which in turn delayed starting search-and-rescue operations.

The leader of the investigative team, which included experts from the U.S., Australia and China, said the report wasn’t final and conclusive given the plane’s wreckage hasn’t been found.

“It is possible that the absence of communications prior to the flight path diversion was due to the systems being manually turned off, whether by intent or otherwise,” Kok Soo Chon said at a news conference.

Apart from listing procedural lapses, the bulk of the report recounted information already released since the jet went missing on its scheduled flight to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. A new investigation appears unlikely given what was in this latest report, which followed a separate one by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau last year, and the fact the search effort has stopped.

“No conclusions are drawn, no blame is assigned,” said Grace Nathan, the daughter of one of the victims on the plane. The report “lacks depth” and may not help prevent such incidents in future, she said, adding the search for the missing plane must continue.

Flight 370 stopped communicating with controllers in the early hours of March 8, 2014. Instead of completing its flight to Beijing, it made a series of inexplicable turns before setting off on a journey into a remote quarter of the Indian Ocean, thousands of kilometers off course, according to satellite data.

After initial search efforts by several militaries failed to find the plane, Australia led a search in the southern Indian Ocean. That also failed to find the aircraft or its data recorders, which could have helped determine the cause of the disaster.

Pieces of aircraft debris found washed up on the coast of east Africa and the French island of Réunion, thousands of kilometers from the likely crash site, were confirmed to be from the Boeing Co. 777 jet, though the main body of the aircraft hasn’t been found. The setting of the wing flap debris suggested it crashed into the ocean in a steep dive instead of gliding down to sea level.

After repeated demands by family members of the victims, all of whom are presumed dead, to keep looking, Texas-based exploration firm Ocean Infinity began a new search at the start of the year. The search was backed by the Malaysian government, which was offering a bounty for the plane if it was found.

Grace Nathan, daughter of missing passenger Anne Daisy, speaks to reporters at the Transport Ministry’s headquarters in Putrajaya, Malaysia, July 30. Photo: fazry ismail/EPA/Shutterstock

It too failed to find any trace of the plane and the search was called off in late May.

Malaysia’s new government, led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, had pledged to release the investigation team’s full, unedited report after winning elections in May, vowing “total transparency” after a heated election campaign.

The previous government had also said it would release the report in full, under norms set by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

Malaysia’s Transport Minister Anthony Loke Siew Fook said the government would review the safety recommendations in the report and take steps to prevent similar future air accidents. The government will also conduct a “thorough investigation” and punish those found guilty of any misconduct, he said.

"U.S. Attorney Robert Khuzami took a few moments in his Tuesday statement about Michael Cohen’s plea deal to sing neutrality’s praise: “His day of reckoning serves as a reminder that we are a nation of laws, with one set of rules that applies equally to everyone.”

Noble words, and they used to mean something. But a disparity of justice is at the heart of our current crisis of faith in institutions. Americans aren’t outraged that the Federal Bureau of Investigation felt obliged to investigate allegations leveled at campaigns, or that a special counsel is looking at Russian electoral interference. They are instead furious that Lady Justice seems to have it in for only one side.

The country has watched the FBI treat one presidential campaign with kid gloves, the other with informants, warrants and eavesdropping. They’ve seen the Justice Department resist all efforts at accountability, even as it fails to hold its own accountable. And don’t get them started on the one-sided media.

And they are now witnessing unequal treatment in special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe. Yes, the former FBI director deserves credit for smoking out the Russian trolls who interfered in 2016. And one can argue he is obliged to pursue any evidence of criminal acts, even those unrelated to Russia. But what cannot be justified is the one-sided nature of his probe.

Consider Mr. Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who this week pleaded guilty to eight felony charges. Six related to his personal business dealings; the other two involved campaign-finance violations arising from payments to women claiming affairs with Donald Trump. The criminal prosecution of campaign-finance offenses is exceptionally rare (most charges are civil), but let’s take Mr. Khuzami’s word for it when he says Mr. Cohen’s crimes are “particularly significant” because he’s a lawyer who should know better, and also because the payments were for the purpose of “influencing an election” and undermining its “integrity.”

If there is only “one set of rules,” where is Mr. Mueller’s referral of a case against Hillary for America? Federal law requires campaigns to disclose the recipient and purpose of any payments. The Clinton campaign paid Fusion GPS to compile a dossier against Mr. Trump, a document that became the basis of the Russia narrative Mr. Mueller now investigates. But the campaign funneled the money to law firm Perkins Coie, which in turn paid Fusion. The campaign falsely described the money as payment for “legal services.” The Democratic National Committee did the same. A Perkins Coie spokesperson has claimed that neither the Clinton campaign nor the DNC was aware that Fusion GPS had been hired to conduct the research, and maybe so. But a lot of lawyers here seemed to have been ignoring a clear statute, presumably with the intent of influencing an election.

Prosecutions under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) are also exceptionally rare, though Mr. Mueller is getting media kudos for hammering the likes of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates for failing to register as lobbyists for foreign entities. The law is the law.

But under this standard, where are the charges against the principals of Fusion GPS, who Sen. Chuck Grassley has said look to have been lobbying on behalf of powerful Russians against a U.S. sanctions law, with its payment again funneled through a law firm? This was a sideline to its dossier work, but Mr. Mueller usually has no issue with sideline charges.

Or what about an evenhanded look at dossier author Christopher Steele ? FARA also requires foreigners to register if they act on behalf of a foreign principal. Recently disclosed emails from senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr show the British Mr. Steele pleading the case to the Justice Department on behalf of a Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska.

Of the seven U.S. citizens Mr. Mueller has charged, five have been accused of (among other things) making false statements to federal officials. But there have been no charges against the partisans who made repeated abjectly false claims to the FBI and Justice Department about actions of their political opponents. There have been no charges against those who leaked classified information, including the unprecedented release of an unmasked conversation between former national security adviser Mike Flynn and a Russian ambassador. Nothing.

Some of these charges might not stand up in court, but that’s beside the point. Plenty of lawyers would poke holes in the campaign-finance charges against Cohen, or the “lying” charges against Mr. Flynn. Special counsels wield immense power; the mere threat of a charge provokes plea deals. It’s the focus that matters.

Prosecutors can claim all they want that they are applying the law equally, but if they only apply it to half the suspects, justice is not served. Mr. Mueller seems blind to the national need for—the basic expectation of—a thorough look into all parties. That omission is fundamentally undermining any legitimacy in his findings. Lady Justice does not wear a blindfold over only one eye.

"WASHINGTON—President Trump reversed course and ordered that the U.S. flag be flown at half-staff for the rest of the week to mark the death of John McCain, after drawing fire from lawmakers and veterans groups who said the Republican senator hadn’t been appropriately honored.

“Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Sen. John McCain’s service to our country and, in his honor, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment,” Mr. Trump said in a statement Monday.

The White House initially lowered its flag to half-staff on Saturday but returned it to full-staff by Monday morning. It was lowered to half-staff again Monday afternoon, shortly before Mr. Trump released his statement. The president’s proclamation covers the White House as well as all federal buildings, military bases and embassies.

White House officials said they prodded Mr. Trump for two days to put out a kind word about Mr. McCain. Mr. Trump resisted, and viewed the news coverage of the former senator’s death as over-the-top and more befitting a president, according to people familiar with the situation. They said cable networks’ focus on the flag controversy came at the expense of more coverage of Mr. Trump’s trade deal with Mexico.

A senior White House official said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was instrumental in getting the president to agree to the proclamation, with the help of chief of staff John Kelly. “It was 99% Sarah,” the official said.

Speaking at a dinner for evangelical leaders at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump offered the country’s “hearts and prayers” to the family of the late senator and added that “we very much appreciate everything Sen. McCain has done for our country.”

The senator’s body will lie in state in the Arizona State Capitol on Wednesday. A ceremony honoring Mr. McCain will be held on Friday at the U.S. Capitol, where he will also lie in state. A service Saturday at Washington National Cathedral will include tributes from former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, according to the senator’s website. Pallbearers will include former Vice President Joe Biden, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and actor Warren Beatty. Mr. McCain will buried at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., on Sunday.

Mr. Trump won’t be attending any of the services honoring Mr. McCain. Mr. Trump said he has asked Vice President Mike Pence to speak at the ceremony honoring Mr. McCain at the Capitol on Friday. He said he has asked Mr. Kelly, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and national security adviser John Bolton to represent the administration at services for Mr. McCain.

Asked whether Mr. McCain or his family had asked Mr. Trump to not attend, McCain family spokesman Rick Davis didn’t answer directly, instead pointing to past media reports that had “by and large come to that conclusion” and saying he wouldn’t discuss further details. “The president will not be, as far as we know, attending the funeral. That’s just a fact,” Mr. Davis said.

Related Video Sen. John McCain's life will be remembered as one of service to his country. Hear him reflect on his years in the Navy, as a prisoner of war, six-term Senator and presidential nominee.

The U.S. flag code calls for flags to be flown at half-staff on the day of death and the following day for a member of Congress, a protocol the White House has followed. But for many other prominent Americans, the flag has been lowered for several days and raised again only once the person is buried.

The White House’s decision to raise the flags prompted criticism from Democrats as well as several members of Mr. Trump’s own party.

“Shameful @POTUS only ordered White House flag at half-staff 4 short time,” tweeted Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida. “Attempts like this to diminish his legacy are pathetically petty.”

Veterans-advocacy groups also had pushed the White House to lower the flag for a longer period.

One of the first was Amvets, which demanded that flags be lowered either until Mr. McCain’s funeral or for one week. Joe Chenelly, the group’s national executive director, said Amvets was prepared to ask all U.S. governors to call for lowering flags in their states if the president wouldn’t act.

“Political backlash be damned on all this,” said Joe Chenelly, national executive director of Amvets. “It’s time to pay the proper respects to someone who helped lead this country in peacetime and war.,” Mr. Chenelly said.

The Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion asked Mr. Trump to keep American flags lowered until Mr. McCain’s interment.

In 2009, the White House ordered that its flags be flown at half-staff for Sen. Ted Kennedy until the day he was buried. And the White House flags were flown at half-staff until former first lady Barbara Bush’s burial this past April.

On Saturday, shortly after Mr. McCain’s passing was announced, Mr. Trump offered his condolences to the family in a short tweet that lacked any comments about Mr. McCain’s service to the nation. He ignored shouted questions about Mr. McCain from reporters at a White House event Monday.

The two have a long history. In 2015, Mr. Trump famously said that Mr. McCain wasn’t a war hero because his plane had been shot down and he was captured in Vietnam.

For his part, Mr. McCain yanked his endorsement of Mr. Trump in October 2016 after a videotape appeared showing the former reality-TV star talking of sexually aggressive behavior toward women.

Mr. McCain also cast a deciding vote against the president’s health-care overhaul in July 2017, drawing regular jabs from Mr. Trump even after he left the Senate and returned home to Arizona due to his illness.

"PERRY MILLS, N.Y.—A small group of people from Nigeria and Mali stepped off a shuttle bus here on a recent evening and lugged suitcases and backpacks along a country road toward the border with Canada. A Canadian police officer was waiting there to arrest them.

The group is part of a fresh wave of asylum seekers flooding into Canada in recent weeks, undeterred by the threat of arrest and posing the latest test for Canada’s immigration-friendly stance.

Roughly 2,600 people used unofficial border crossings like this one to enter the country in April, according to Canadian police data. That marked the latest surge following the crossing last summer of some 8,500 asylum seekers.

People breaching the border is a new challenge for Canada. The country’s geographic isolation has traditionally allowed it to maintain a highly selective immigration and refugee system, as migrants from Africa and the Middle East have poured into Europe in recent years and the U.S. has grappled with illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America.

“It forces Canadians, who have always patted themselves on the back for being very open to immigration, very welcoming, to deal with the kinds of challenges Italy, Greece and others have been facing and to realize it’s not so easy,” said Irene Bloemraad, a migration expert and the chair of Canadian studies at University of California, Berkeley.

Canada’s Liberal government has faced heated criticism over its handling of the influx. The opposition Conservatives want the government to shut down unofficial border crossings, saying the asylum seekers using them are sapping resources normally devoted to processing applicants from other immigration and refugee streams. The Immigration and Refugee Board, which decides on asylum claims, has a backlog of 53,000 cases, and the labor union representing Canada’s border officers has said that staffing is insufficient to deal with the added pressure of asylum seekers.

“They risk turning Canadian support away from our once compassionate and orderly immigration system,” Conservative lawmaker Michelle Rempel said in a press conference last week.

The province of Quebec complained publicly last month that it wasn’t receiving enough support from the federal government to deal with the new spike in asylum seekers. In response, officials have promised to come up with a plan for moving more asylum seekers into English-speaking provinces.

Last year, facing the arrival of thousands of Haitians who feared losing their temporary protected status in the U.S., Canadian officials began a campaign to dissuade them from turning up at the border and seeking asylum. The effort included targeted advertising and visits to Haitian and Central American communities to dispel rumors that Canada granted automatic residency.

For a while, the efforts appeared to be working, and asylum claims at the border fell sharply. But those earlier arrivals have been replaced by others, mostly from Nigeria, officials said, illustrating the challenge Canadian officials face in identifying and preventing the next big influx.

Officials say the Nigerians have been turning up at the Canadian border after obtaining visas that allow them to travel to the U.S.

Last week, Canada Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said the U.S. and Canada are studying a 14-year-old treaty called the Safe Third Country Agreement that requires asylum seekers to make their claims in whichever country they arrive first.

There is an exception if they enter Canada illegally, making routes like the one used from upstate New York into Quebec popular because it allows asylum seekers to get around the deal. Canada says it isn’t practical to apply the agreement to the entire border, in part because much of the border isn’t staffed by guards.

Unless police believe they represent a threat to Canada, asylum seekers are released after their arrest and don’t face criminal charges.

The response in Canada to the wave of asylum seekers has been mixed. A Quebec-based organization called Bridges Not Borders has sent delegations to the border to greet incoming migrants and is lobbying Canadian officials to allow asylum seekers to use official points of entry. But last year, the arrival of thousands of Haitians in the French-speaking province triggered several anti-immigration rallies. Another Quebec group is planning a protest at the border with New York state later this month. The group wants asylum seekers turned back if they approach at unofficial crossings.

Mr. Hussen and other officials are concerned shutting down unofficial crossings would push migrants to use more dangerous routes and sneak into the country undetected. Instead, they are trying head off a big wave of claimants ahead of summer. The minister met with Nigeria’s high commissioner to Canada last month to discuss the rise in the number of Nigerians using U.S. visas to enter Canada and then claim asylum. His department has also sent officers to Nigeria to communicate with U.S. embassy officials about abuse of travel visas; Mr. Hussen is in Nigeria this week. The Canadian government also aims to send officials to Nigerian churches in the U.S. to dispel myths of easy entry to Canada.

In the course of seven hours on a recent Wednesday, 25 people made the trek at an unofficial border crossing between New York state and the Canadian province of Quebec. Groups arrived by taxi or shuttle bus to Roxham Road, a quiet route that dead-ends at a small ditch marking the local border between Canada and the U.S.

They included people from Nigeria, Lebanon, Haiti, Sri Lanka, Mali and Ivory Coast who headed directly toward the Canadian police officers stationed on the other side of the stream, walking past signs warning that crossing the border here is illegal and claiming asylum “is not a free ticket into Canada.”

One woman said she and her family had taken a plane from Nigeria to New York City, then a bus to Plattsburgh, N.Y., and a shuttle to the Canadian border.

“We came here for protection, for a better life,” she said, adding that her family faced persecution and worries over female genital mutilation in Nigeria. She declined to give her name as she hurried across.

Janet McFetridge, an American woman who lives about 5 miles from the Roxham Road border crossing, has visited the border almost daily over the past year to hand out hats, mittens, coats and coloring books for children. During that time, she has collected a large envelope of personal items that people have discarded on their way to the border. The envelope includes a Nigerian identity card and airline tickets showing travel from several different U.S. cities.

Once arrested for crossing the border at an unofficial entry point, asylum seekers are sent by shuttle bus to shelters in Montreal. Asylum seekers can ultimately be deported if their claims are unsuccessful.

Audrey Macklin, an expert in migration law at University of Toronto, said Canada needs to ensure adequate resources to settle new arrivals and handle their claims.

“Canadians certainly are very proud of their recent record of resettling Syrian refugees,” she said. “I think that their views about people who make asylum claims [at the border] are more volatile.”

"WASHINGTON—President Trump said Canada would be left out of a new North American Free Trade Agreement if a “fair deal for the U.S.” isn’t reached—and warned Congress he would terminate the deal entirely if lawmakers “interfere” in the negotiations.

Mr. Trump’s warning on Saturday comes a day after U.S. and Canadian negotiators failed to reach an agreement on Friday, a deadline he set, to revamp the trade deal that includes Mexico. The two sides have agreed to continue the trade talks.

...",politics
"Marathon trade talks between the U.S. and Canada moved into what Canada’s chief negotiator called “an intense rhythm,” as the two sides rushed to try to strike a deal by the Friday deadline set by the Trump administration.

Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland spoke briefly to reporters Thursday afternoon during a break on the third day of the talks in Washington.

Ms. Freeland didn’t elaborate on the substance of the exchange. “The atmosphere is good, and there’s good will on both sides,” she said. “We are making progress.”

A spokesman for Ms. Freeland’s U.S. counterpart, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Ms. Freeland, who arrived in Washington on Tuesday, met Thursday morning with Mr. Lighthizer and Jared Kushner, a senior adviser and son-in-law of President Trump. She met again with Mr. Lighthizer for four hours from late Thursday afternoon into the evening.

“There remains distance on key issues,” a Canadian official familiar with the discussions said during a break. The official declined to say whether the Friday deadline could be met, saying “we’ll take the time it takes to get a good deal for Canada.”

Messrs. Kushner and Lighthizer have been in talks with Canadian negotiators for at least six hours a day, according to a person familiar with the talks. Friday remains the “anticipated date” for reaching an agreement, the person said, but the negotiators “are not going to settle simply because they set that as the deadline.”

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, briefed Canadian provincial leaders on the state of the talks.

Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard told reporters in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, that “things are going well” in terms of the Nafta negotiations, after participating in the call with Mr. Trudeau. He declined to provide further details.

Mr. Couillard, who is seeking re-election this fall, has been one of the most outspoken Canadian politicians worried about how changes to Nafta could affect the province.

While his trade team was locked in talks with Canada, Mr. Trump used an interview with Bloomberg News Thursday to reiterate his longstanding criticism of the World Trade Organization. “If they don’t shape up, I would withdraw from the WTO,” he said.

Mr. Trump and his aides have argued that the Geneva-based organization has unfairly ruled against U.S. trade policies, and his administration has moved in recent months to block the appointment of WTO court judges in protest. But despite Mr. Trump’s rhetoric, there has been no sign that the administration is planning a full pullout from the institution.

The U.S. and Canadian teams are negotiating to rewrite the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, which the Trump administration has deemed unfair to American commerce. Mr. Trump on Monday announced an agreement on a new trade deal with the bloc’s third partner, Mexico, and said he was prepared to replace the trilateral agreement with a U.S.-Mexico accord unless Canada joined in quickly.

The Trump administration has said it would like to wrap up the talks this week so it can send a formal statement to Congress of its intent to reach a new agreement by Friday. That deadline reflects a U.S. law requiring a president to give lawmakers 90 days’ notice before signing a trade agreement. U.S. and Mexican officials say they want to have the deal signed by Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, whose term ends Nov. 30, rather than risk agreements being reopened by his left-wing successor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

A main focus of the U.S.-Canada talks is Ottawa’s insistence that any revised Nafta maintain special courts where any of the three member countries can challenge tariffs imposed by one of the others—a provision Canada has long considered important to protect its industry from U.S. government actions. Mr. Lighthizer has sought to remove that provision, arguing that it infringes on American sovereignty, and persuaded Mexico to acquiesce to that demand.

The U.S. and Canada are also haggling over Canadian policies protecting the dairy industry. Mr. Trump has repeatedly complained that those policies unfairly limit sales of U.S. dairy products in the Canadian market.

"VIENNA—The U.S. and Germany are at odds over a possible plan to redraw the border between Serbia and Kosovo and resolve one of Europe’s last major territorial disputes, with Berlin concerned the move could open a Pandora’s box of ethnic recriminations in some of the region’s poorest countries.

Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, is regarded by Serbia as a breakaway state. But to seek backing for eventual European Union membership, the leaders of both nations have said they are considering border changes that could make the countries more ethnically and religiously homogeneous. There have been repeated clashes since 1999 between ethnic Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo, especially in the ethnically divided northern city of Mitrovica.

National security adviser John Bolton said last week that Washington had no qualms with the idea, despite two decades of Western opposition. But German officials said Friday they remain deeply skeptical.

“We don’t think discussions on a land swap between Kosovo and Serbia are constructive,” said German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, on his way into discussions in Vienna between EU foreign ministers and Balkan officials. “It can open up too many old wounds among the people there.”

U.S. support for a land swap in Europe’s southeast is among a number of issues on which Berlin and Washington disagree: President Trump has criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel for Germany’s relatively low military spending, the terms of trade between the two countries, and Berlin’s support for the Iranian nuclear deal.

The idea of redrafting borders to make Balkan countries more ethnically homogenous is unpopular among many European governments. Some of Europe’s top officials began their careers in the Balkans, and personally witnessed the wars in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, in which about 140,000 people died. However, the EU has also sought a solution to the Kosovo-Serbia dispute for years. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Friday she is open to a land-swap deal provided it is in line with EU and international law.

Key issues from those conflicts, which continued into the early 2000s, lie unresolved: Bosnia and Herzegovina remains divided, with a Serbian enclave that is largely autonomous. Serbia doesn’t recognize Kosovo, and neither can join the EU until that disagreement gets settled.

Washington and Berlin have generally seen eye-to-eye on the region since President Bill Clinton presided over the 1995 Dayton Peace Talks that brought an uneasy peace to the central theater of the Yugoslav Wars: Bosnia and Herzegovina.

But under Mr. Trump, the U.S. has signaled interest in reversing American policy on the region.

The dispute between Serbia and Kosovo stretches back into the 1990s. In 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization launched a bombing campaign against Serbia to stop what Western countries called ethnic cleansing against Kosovo’s mostly Muslim Albanians.

When Kovoso declared independence in 2008, Serbia, supported by Russia, refused to accept it.

While it has spearheaded negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia, the dispute has also divided the EU. Five member states, including Spain, don’t recognize Kosovo.

In recent weeks, the presidents of Serbia and Kosovo have both said they are ready for fresh negotiations. Serbian President Aleksandr Vucic is expected to set out his proposal next month during a visit to Kosovo.

“If the two parties can work it out between themselves and reach agreement, we don’t exclude territorial adjustments,” Mr. Bolton said last week in a press conference in Ukraine. “It’s obviously a difficult issue…But we would not stand in the way.”

A deal could face significant domestic criticism. Serbian Orthodox clergy have opposed such a move, as have leading Kosovar politicians. Officials in neighboring Bosnia have expressed concern that it would further fuel the independence drive of Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik. Some European leaders worry it could sow fresh ethnic strife in Macedonia, which has experienced sporadic bouts of violence involving the country’s Albanian minority.

“We must be very careful not to cause new problems” in the region, said Finnish Foreign Minister Timo Soini on Friday.

The region’s borders are “inviolable,” Ms. Merkel said earlier this month.

Next week, Ms. Mogherini is set to host Mr. Vucic and Kosovar President Hashim Thaci in Brussels. The two men were on opposing sides during the Kosovo conflict in 1999 and are now the dominant political figures at home.

While neither side has set out specifics, a land swap could see Serb-dominated northern sections of Kosovo ceded to Serbia, while Kosovo gains territory in the ethnic Albanian Presevo Valley, which lies on the Serbian side of the Western-recognized border.

Mr. Vucic, whose government is advancing in membership talks with the EU, said last week he wants European backing for a deal.

"CARACAS, Venezuela—The exodus of Venezuelans gained pace as the government’s plans to address the collapsing economy fueled anxiety, while tensions grew in neighboring countries that have strained to absorb refugees.

Over the weekend, Venezuela’s battered business sector warned that President Nicolás Maduro’s plans—including a leap in the minimum wage, new taxes and a currency devaluation—would paralyze the economy and drive more people out. About 2.3 million have fled since 2014, according to United Nations estimates.

Meanwhile, a mob burned a refugee camp in Brazil on Saturday in retaliation for a robbery purportedly committed by four Venezuelans, prompting that country’s president, Michel Temer, to order 120 troops to the troubled border. In Ecuador, the government on Saturday began requiring Venezuelans to have a passport, which are nearly impossible to obtain. Peru said it would follow suit after police arrested five Venezuelan men accused of planning a bank robbery.

Colombia, which has taken in about one million Venezuelans, is awaiting the arrival of a U.S. Navy hospital ship, the Comfort, to provide Venezuelans medical treatment.

For many who remain, it seems as if Venezuela is splitting at the seams. Rolling blackouts have crimped oil output, energy consultants said. Heavy rains, meanwhile, have devastated the south and west near Colombia, leaving some villages under water and residents pleading with government officials for help.

Venezuela’s opposition, its leaders at odds over how to deal with the crisis, joined with representatives of some oil workers’ unions to call for a national strike on Tuesday, the day Mr. Maduro’s economic measures are to take effect.

“Tuesday’s call is the first step to unify the people in the struggle,” Andres Velasquez, a prominent opposition politician, said on Sunday. “Maduro’s measures are not meant to improve the economy but instead represent more hunger and poverty.”

Another opposition politician, Maria Corina Machado, said in an interview that Venezuelans and regional governments needed to step up the pressure on Mr. Maduro. If nothing is done, she said of the government: “They can annihilate us and impose their mafia state.”

Still, Mr. Maduro has weathered protests in his tumultuous five years in power, cracking down on demonstrators with such fury that few now dare to protest.

The president’s new measures include a new currency called the sovereign bolivar, which will lop five zeros off the existing tender. Many economists said the move fails to address the real cause of inflation: uncontrolled printing of money.

The rollout comes as Mr. Maduro plans to raise the minimum wage to about $30 a month from less than $1.

Economists warn the measures will drive inflation even higher than the 1,000,000% the International Monetary Fund projects this year. The government, which is in default on $6 billion in debt, is expected to print more bank notes to make up for a loss of export earnings that has come with the drop in oil production.

The president has also pledged to raise the price of subsidized gasoline, which in the past has sparked riots. The plan is for subsidies to be maintained with the national identification Fatherland Card, which critics said is used for social control. Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said new gasoline prices wouldn’t be announced before late September.

For ordinary people, Mr. Maduro’s measures mean more anguish and uncertainty.

Those trying to stick it out here said Mr. Maduro’s proposals would destroy what was left of the economy. Those Venezuelans considering fleeing worried about the growing backlash against hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who have already left.

Maria Planchart once lived comfortably in Caracas and had aspirations of being a lawyer. In this WSJ Films documentary, we follow her struggle to feed her family.

“Everything is chaos,” said Nelly Baric, an employee at a public hospital who once supported the so-called revolutionary government that, upon taking power 19 years ago, promised to upend the old economic and social order. “I’m afraid they will close more small businesses and, if you consider the [low] production today, which is very insufficient, then you can imagine the situation we’re in.”

Randú Carvajal plans to close his Caracas restaurant and hasn’t ruled out migrating. “We don’t know what to do. All the prices are going to go up.”

Mr. Maduro on Friday night asked Venezuelans to trust his economic measures.

A former bus driver and union activist, Mr. Maduro trained in Communist Cuba as a young man but never received an education in economics; his primary economic adviser has been Alfredo Serrano, a Spanish leftist who adheres to the theory that the U.S., angry about a socialist government in its hemisphere, is orchestrating the disaster that has befallen this country of 30 million.

“Let’s have faith,” Mr. Maduro said as he unveiled details of his plan. “Rest assured that sooner or later, we, in economic matters, will be harvesting victories.…I trust in you and I ask for your support.”

In Caracas, large parts of the capital don’t have running water, and some wealthy residential complexes are drilling their own wells.

On Sunday, Caracas and many other cities were like ghost towns. Stores that normally open were mostly closed, their owners afraid they would be swamped by panicked shoppers. Gas stations, in contrast, did a brisk business as people rushed to fill their tanks, fearing a price increase. Some stores selling perishables, like meat, opened with hopes of unloading their stock.

José Ramón Pérez, a vegetable dealer, was open but said suppliers hadn’t sent produce. “There are almost no goods, look at the empty stalls,” he said, adding that some were hoarding, awaiting the new currency and new prices.

María de Figueira, who also sells produce, predicted chaos as Mr. Maduro’s new measures are felt. “We’ll probably be insulted by clients who are as confused as I am,” she said. “When something costs 3.4 million bolivars and I tell people it’s now 34 bolivars they’ll look at me and say they cost three or four.”

The outflow of people from what was once Latin America’s richest nation has exacerbated tensions in neighboring countries, particularly with poorer classes who have had to compete with Venezuelans desperate for any kind of job.

In Brazil on Sunday, Mr. Temer held an emergency cabinet meeting a day after a mob of Brazilians upset by news reports that four Venezuelans had beaten up a storekeeper during a robbery burned a refugee shelter. The Brazilians chased some desperate Venezuelans back across the border.

“They burned everything. Brazilians took it all, our bags, everything,” an unidentified Venezuelan woman told Brazil’s GloboTV. Scores of Brazilians sang the national anthem while police escorted refugees out of Paracaima, a town located on the border with Venezuela.

One Brazilian in a video said war had been declared with the robbery by the Venezuelans. “God only knows what may happen,” he said.

The news from abroad made Luis Lorenzo, 34 years old, who is considering leaving, think twice. “I feel fear to be rejected upon arrival,” he said, “and that will make finding a job harder.”

"Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic rupture with Canada risks complicating the kingdom’s efforts to woo foreign investors as it seeks to overhaul its economy.

Saudi Arabia on Monday declared Canada’s ambassador persona non grata, and gave him 24 hours to leave the country. The decision to expel the Canadian ambassador, Dennis Horak, came after Canada’s Foreign Ministry criticized Saudi Arabia for arresting human-rights activists.

In pushing back against what it described as an unacceptable attempt by Canada to interfere in its domestic affairs, the Saudi Foreign Ministry announced it “will put on hold all new business and investment transactions with Canada.”

The diplomatic spat with Canada will also affect 7,000 Saudi students who are currently in Canada on government-sponsored scholarships. The spokesman for Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Education, Mubarak al-Osaimi, on Monday said that the kingdom would stop funding scholarships and training programs in Canada, and that it would help transfer Saudis affected by the decision to other countries.

Separately, Saudia airlines, the national carrier, announced it would suspend flights to Canada from Aug. 13.

Canada’s Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Monday the government was “deeply concerned” by Saudi Arabia’s move to expel Canada’s ambassador on the basis of statements “in defence of human-rights activists detained in the kingdom.”

At a press conference in Vancouver, she said officials were waiting to hear from Saudi Arabia about how the relationship between Canada and the kingdom unfolds given this diplomatic row.

“We stand by what we have said,” she said. “We will always speak up for human rights and women’s rights.”

The eruption in tensions between allies risks fueling concerns among investors during a tumultuous period of change for the kingdom.

More than three years later, the Saudi-led coalition remains bogged down in Yemen, with no solution to the conflict in sight.

AUGUST 2018: Saudi Arabia expelled Canada’s ambassador to Riyadh and blocked all new business relations. The move came after Canada’s foreign ministry publicly reprimanded the kingdom for the arrest of human rights activists.

Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has launched a grand reform plan, called Vision 2030, that aims to transform the kingdom from a staunchly conservative petrostate to a more socially liberal country less dependent on oil. But Prince Mohammed has also made it clear he won’t brook outside criticism of key decisions—a stance that analysts say could threaten capital flows that Saudi Arabia needs for its overhaul.

“Branding Saudi Arabia as an attractive destination for investment and trade is one of the underlying assumptions of Saudi Vision 2030,” said Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor and Middle East expert at the University of Ottawa. “Impulsive foreign-policy decisions like this have the exact opposite effect.”

Despite the recent rebound in oil prices, Saudi leaders have struggled to persuade businesses to come to the kingdom. Foreign direct investment into Saudi Arabia plunged to $1.4 billion in 2017 from $7.4 billion the previous year, according to United Nations trade figures released in June. The slide marked a 14-year low.

There have been notable exceptions to otherwise modest investor interest. SoftBank Group Corp.’s $100 billion technology fund is setting up an office in Riyadh, and foreign companies including cinema operators have invested in the entertainment industry.

But Saudi Arabia has been rolling out other domesticmeasures—such as a new value-added tax, cuts to energy subsidies and restrictions on hiring foreign workers—that have made the kingdom less attractive to overseas capital. The arrest of prominent businessmen last year as part of a sweeping corruption crackdown also spooked investors.

The kingdom’s aggressive foreign-policy posture is now a significant concern, analysts said, because it reflects a sensitivity among top leaders that is likely to deepen uncertainty among investors.

“There is a brashness that reflects quick reactions, rather than thoughtful deliberation,” said Karen Young, a political economist at the Washington-based Arab Gulf States Institute. “For businesses, these actions underline the risk of offending the ruling family and state on a number of issues where red lines and clear rules are absent.”

Canada isn’t alone. Diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Germany have been strained since November, when Germany’s then-foreign minister criticized the kingdom for having pressured Lebanon’s prime minister to resign. After that, the Saudi government quietly ordered that no new contracts be awarded to German companies, according to people familiar with the matter.

“Expelling an ambassador over criticism of human-rights issues is the worst thing you can do,” a Gulf-based diplomat said. “It confirms prejudices about Saudi Arabia that exist among businessmen in Europe, for instance, while helping investors from countries where business comes first and that aren’t too concerned about human rights issues.”

Saudi Arabia’s freeze on trade with Canada isn’t expected to affect the Canadian economy. Two-way trade between the countries was relativelysmall, totaling roughly 4 billion Canadian dollars (US$3.08 billion) in 2017, according to Canadian government data. Saudi Arabia accounts for just 0.24% of Canadian exports in 2016, according to the latest World Bank data.

It isn’t clear whether the diplomatic spat could affect specific deals, such as the C$15 billion arms deal agreed to in 2014 for the sale of light-armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia from the Canada-based division of General Dynamics Land Systems.

Canada isn’t the only country that has called for the release of human rights defenders detained by Saudi authorities in recent months. The U.S., the United Nations and the European Union have also publicly expressed concern over the arrests.

Since May, at least 18 activists have been arrested, of which four have been temporarily released. Many of them had campaigned for women’s rights, including for allowing women to drive, a right that was granted in June. Among those arrested most recently is Samar Badawi, a prominent activist and sister of the jailed blogger Raif Badawi.

"Michael Cohen had many reasons to play ball last weekend when his legal team sat down to talk to federal prosecutors.

The Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office had testimony from Mr. Cohen’s accountant and business partners, along with bank records, tax filings and loan applications that implicated not only Mr. Cohen in potential criminal activity, but also his wife, who filed taxes jointly with her husband. Prosecutors signaled Mr. Cohen would face nearly 20 criminal counts, potentially carrying a lengthy prison sentence and staggering financial penalties.

Adding to the pressure, David Pecker, the chairman of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, provided prosecutors with details about payments Mr. Cohen arranged with women who alleged sexual encounters with President Trump, including Mr. Trump’s knowledge of the deals.

This account of how Mr. Cohen went from a pugnacious defender of the president to turning on Mr. Trump is based on details provided by people close to Mr. Cohen and others briefed on the discussions with prosecutors.

For weeks, the president had been distancing himself from Mr. Cohen, including by stopping paying his longtime attorney’s legal fees, making clear amid the pressure that he was on his own.

Under oath on Tuesday, before a packed courtroom, Mr. Cohen created a spectacular moment without parallel in American history when he confessed to two crimes that he said he committed at the behest of the man who would become president.

Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes, including tax evasion and making false statements to a bank, capping a monthslong investigation into his business dealings and work as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer. For the president, it opens up a perilous new legal front.

Mr. Cohen in court said Mr. Trump directed him to arrange payments during the 2016 campaign to two women who alleged they had sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. The payments violated caps on campaign contributions and a ban on corporate contributions, prosecutors said.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump denied he directed Mr. Cohen to buy the women’s silence. Contradicting earlier statements, the president said he became aware of the payments to the women “later on” and said Mr. Cohen was reimbursed from his personal funds, not his 2016 campaign coffers.

The investigation is continuing, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Although the plea deal doesn’t require Mr. Cohen’s cooperation, it leaves the door open for him to talk with both the Southern District of New York and special counsel Robert Mueller. The court restricted Mr. Cohen’s travel to New York City; Chicago, where he owns taxi medallions; South Florida, where his parents live; and Washington, D.C., where the special counsel is based.

The deal doesn’t preclude further prosecutions, including other charges against Mr. Cohen.

Prosecutors built their case partly by using materials seized in April 9 raids of Mr. Cohen’s home, office and hotel, including recordings and other items that provided evidence of campaign-finance violations.

Investigators quickly zeroed in on Mr. Cohen’s relationship with American Media, including its role brokering deals on behalf of Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker had been an open supporter of Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Prosecutors say Mr. Pecker offered to help keep quiet negative stories about Mr. Trump that might come to the National Enquirer, a practice in the business known as “catch and kill.”

American Media executives were involved in both hush-money deals that formed the basis of Mr. Cohen’s guilty plea to campaign-finance violations, prosecutors said on Tuesday. One was a $130,000 payment to Stephanie Clifford—a former porn star who goes professionally by Stormy Daniels—as part of an agreement to keep her from publicly discussing an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. The payment was first reported by The Wall Street Journal in January.

The second was a $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her exclusive story of an alleged extramarital affair with Mr. Trump, a story that was purchased by American Media in August 2016 at Mr. Cohen’s urging, and then never published. The payment was first reported by the Journal in November 2016.

On April 5, days before the raids, Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One he didn’t know about the payment to Ms. Clifford, and referred questions about the matter to Mr. Cohen. “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen,” Mr. Trump said. “Michael is my attorney.”

Mr. Cohen, who that night was staying aboard the yacht of Trump donor Franklin Haney, which was docked in Miami, grew irate on the ship soon after Mr. Trump made his remarks distancing himself from the Clifford payment, according to a person familiar with the episode. Mr. Cohen was swearing loudly as others on the boat were sipping their drinks, the person said.

The search warrant executed on April 9 sought materials and information related to a wide range of communications, including ones related to the payments to Ms. Clifford and Ms. McDougal. At the same time, investigators subpoenaed Mr. Pecker, American Media and the Trump Organization, Mr. Trump’s business.

Prosecutors had reason to be concerned that without raiding Mr. Cohen’s office, “records could have been deleted without record and without recourse for law enforcement,” according to a court filing.

Prosecutors in the Southern District said the investigation into Mr. Cohen was, in part, a referral from the special counsel’s office. It isn’t clear when the referral took place, or if the office was already investigating Mr. Cohen when the referral came through.

The special counsel’s office was examining Mr. Cohen’s finances since at least October 2017, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Prior to the raids, investigators had already obtained covert search warrants on multiple email accounts used by Mr. Cohen, prosecutors said in a court filing. Early this year, they also had subpoenaed Mr. Cohen’s former accountant, Jeffrey A. Getzel, who handled Mr. Cohen’s personal and business tax returns.

In May, Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for Ms. Clifford, released a memo detailing payments made to Mr. Cohen from companies including AT&T Inc. and Novartis AG , as well as an investment firm linked to a Russian oligarch. Federal agents investigated whether Mr. Cohen lobbied Trump administration officials on the companies’ behalf without registering as a lobbyist, the Journal previously reported.

Initially, Mr. Cohen seemed unlikely to turn on the president. Although their relationship was at times turbulent, Mr. Trump appreciated Mr. Cohen’s absolute loyalty. On the day of the raids, Mr. Trump called the move a “disgrace” and a “witch hunt.”

Soon after the April raids, Mr. Cohen’s relationship with Mr. Trump began to deteriorate.

The estrangement began over legal bills, said a person who has spoken with Mr. Cohen about the matter. The Trump family covered part of Mr. Cohen’s legal fees after the raids, but then stopped paying.

Mr. Cohen felt exposed. Public comments by Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, put distance between the president and Mr. Cohen and further alienated the attorney, the person said.

Mr. Cohen told associates and friends he felt Mr. Trump didn’t have his back and vented that the president hadn’t personally offered to pay his legal bills in the Manhattan investigation, which he said were “bankrupting” him.

Mr. Cohen’s troubles increased in May, when Evgeny “Gene” Freidman, a New York City taxi mogul who managed taxi medallions owned by Mr. Cohen and his relatives, pleaded guilty to state criminal tax fraud and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in their probe of Mr. Cohen.

By then, prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service had focused on Mr. Cohen’s personal income taxes. In conversations with a potential witness in June and July, investigators asked “very pointed” questions about various tax filings, according to a person familiar with the conversations.

“They knew what they wanted, they knew what they had, and they went after it,” the person said.

In late June, Mr. Cohen openly broke with Mr. Trump.

A personal turning point for Mr. Cohen was a conversation with his father, Maurice Cohen, a Holocaust survivor.

Mr. Cohen’s father urged him not to protect the president, saying he didn’t survive the Holocaust to have his name sullied by Mr. Trump, according to a person who was told about the conversation. The elder Mr. Cohen couldn’t be reached for comment.

On June 20, Mr. Cohen stepped down from his position as the Republican National Committee’s deputy finance chairman and tweeted his first public criticism of his former boss: “As the son of a Polish holocaust survivor, the images and sounds of this family separation policy [are] heart wrenching.” The tweet no longer appears on Mr. Cohen’s Twitter account.

By then, Mr. Cohen had hired New York lawyer Guy Petrillo to represent him in the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s probe. The choice of Mr. Petrillo, who had once served as the chief of the office’s criminal division, was seen as a sign that Mr. Cohen hoped to cooperate. Mr. Petrillo began to signal this intent to prosecutors.

Shortly after Mr. Petrillo’s hiring, Mr. Cohen told ABC News in an interview that his first loyalty was to his family and country, not to the president.

In July, a recording became public that Mr. Cohen surreptitiously made of a conversation he had with Mr. Trump in September 2016 about buying the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story. The president has denied the affair.

The president’s legal team had waived attorney-client privilege on the recording, which had been seized in the April 9 raids.

The week of the recording’s release, the investigation appeared to accelerate, people familiar with the investigation said.

Federal prosecutors faced an early September deadline to charge Mr. Cohen. After that, they would have to wait until after the midterm elections, under Department of Justice guidelines, or risk criticism of potentially affecting the election’s outcome. They had follow-up witness interviews scheduled as recently as this week, a person familiar with the investigation said, but canceled them as the plea agreement came together over the weekend.

Given the Justice Department’s policy of not indicting sitting presidents, a guilty plea from Mr. Cohen and his public implication of Mr. Trump were among the strongest outcomes prosecutors could have hoped for, according to former federal prosecutors. For prosecutors, the guilty plea meant they could avoid a contentious trial and free up resources to pursue other investigations.

On Monday, Manhattan federal prosecutors filed a court document, in a case then labeled as U.S. v. John Doe, indicating a guilty plea was forthcoming.

By Tuesday night, hours after Mr. Cohen implicated Mr. Trump in a possible crime, one of Mr. Cohen’s lawyers, Lanny Davis, appeared on cable news shows to say Mr. Cohen wouldn’t accept a pardon from Mr. Trump and “is more than happy to tell the special counsel all that he knows.”

"A U.S. federal judge authorized the seizure of Citgo Petroleum Corp. to satisfy a Venezuelan government debt, a ruling that could set off a scramble among Venezuela’s many unpaid creditors to wrest control of its only obviously seizable U.S. asset.

Judge Leonard P. Stark of the U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., issued the ruling Thursday. However, his full opinion, which could include conditions or impose further legal hurdles, was sealed. A redacted version is expected to be available at a later date.

The court order raises the likelihood that Venezuela’s state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela SA, will lose control of a valuable external asset amid the country’s deepening economic and political crisis. The decision could still be appealed to a higher, federal court.

Attorneys for PdVSA weren’t available for comment. Citgo declined to comment.

Crystallex International Corp., a defunct Canadian gold miner that filed the legal action, is trying to collect on a judgment over lost mining rights involving Venezuela’s government. It has targeted Citgo, an oil refiner, because this is the largest U.S. asset of the cash-strapped and crisis-riven country.

Many other creditors of Venezuela are also circling Citgo, but Crystallex is the first to win a judgment authorizing its seizure. Crystallex had argued that Citgo was ultimately owned by PdVSA, which is an “alter ego” of Venezuela that is liable for the South American country’s debts. The judge’s decision in favor of Crystallex allows it to take control of shares of Citgo’s U.S.-based parent company, the first step toward a sale of the company.

Venezuela and its various state-controlled entities together have $62 billion of unsecured bonds outstanding, with approximately $5 billion so far in unpaid interest and principal. Analysts estimate that the government has approximately $150 billion total in debt outstanding to creditors around the world.

Venezuela and its state-controlled entities including PdVSA began missing bond payments last year and have since spiraled into a widespread default. U.S. sanctions bar creditors from engaging the Venezuelan government in any kind of restructuring or buying new debt.

Maria Planchart once lived comfortably in Caracas and had aspirations of being a lawyer. In this WSJ Films documentary, we follow her struggle to feed her family.

For Venezuela, losing control of Citgo could jeopardize one of its only remaining sources of oil revenue, the U.S. At the same time, investors in Venezuela’s defaulted debt—as well at least 43 companies pursuing legal claims against the government—risk losing one of the few obvious assets in the U.S. that can be seized for repayment.

The only payment made this year by Venezuela was $107 million on its PdVSA bonds, due 2020, for which Citgo is pledged as collateral. That was a clear move by Caracas to protect that asset, analysts have said.

Without ownership of Citgo, investors worry PdVSA would have little incentive to continue to pay on the debt

Any sale of Citgo stock would require U.S. Treasury Department approval, and Crystallex needs to clear other legal hurdles before the shares could be sold.

In trying to lay claim to Citgo, creditors are following a familiar playbook. Hedge funds led by Elliott Management Corp. did something similar when they went after Argentine assets following that country’s 2001 default, the largest sovereign default at the time, on more than $80 billion in sovereign debt.

When Argentina refused to pay settlements arising from the default, the hedge funds sought out Argentine assets to seize and argued that everything from the assets of its central bank to its state-controlled oil company were an “alter ego” of the state.

Elliott in 2012 persuaded a Ghanaian court to impound a training vessel of the Argentine Navy, and in 2014 asked a California court to block Argentina from launching satellites into space. Argentina settled with the hedge funds in 2016, delivering gains of as much as 900% on some of their original principal investments.

"China’s first-ever landing of a heavy bomber on a disputed island in the South China Sea punctuates a steady buildup of military assets that has solidified Beijing’s claims to one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.

On Friday, China’s air force disclosed it had landed an H-6K bomber on an island in the area, which would “help improve actual combat capabilities in responding to various security threats at sea.”

Experts who track China’s military moves said the landing was on Woody Island in the Paracels, an island chain where claims by Vietnam, China and Taiwan intersect.

The landing was the latest in a series of military moves that China has carried out while global attention has been focused on the standoff with North Korea. Earlier this month, China deployed antiship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles on the disputed Spratly Islands off the coast of the Philippines for the first time.

Satellite imagery also shows Beijing has installed radars and communication-jamming equipment on the Paracels and Spratlys in recent months, and that Chinese navy ships and military aircraft have made frequent visits.

Together, the deployments give China an interconnected array of radar, missile batteries and airfields that will allow it to project power over hundreds of miles of ocean where the U.S. Navy’s dominance previously faced few serious challenges. “They crossed a big threshold,” said Euan Graham, director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute.

The militarization of the South China Sea is part of a broader push by President Xi Jinping to assert control over long-claimed territory and extend China’s defensive perimeter further into the Pacific, moves that are popular at home. As much as a third of global trade passes annually through the 1.35 million square miles of ocean, which is also thought to be rich in natural resources including oil and natural gas. China says it has historical claims to almost the entire area and that it has the right to defend those claims.

China staged its biggest military show of force in the South China Sea last month when it deployed dozens of navy vessels, including an aircraft carrier and nuclear-missile submarines, off its southern Hainan island.

The White House said this month that it has raised concerns with Beijing about the militarization of the South China Sea and warned there would be consequences. The new commander of U.S. Pacific naval forces, Adm. Philip Davidson, told a Senate committee in April that China had nearly completed military bases on its reclaimed South China Sea islands. “China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States,” he said.

The Pacific Command and China’s Defense Ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment.

"WASHINGTON—President Trump canceled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s scheduled weekend trip to North Korea in a series of tweets Friday after a briefing, signaling for the first time frustration with deadlocked nuclear talks.

“I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea, at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula…” Mr. Trump said on Twitter.

Mr. Trump’s decision appeared to take State Department officials by surprise. Mr. Pompeo named a new special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, to lead the talks only a day earlier, and staffers were preparing for the trip to go ahead on Sunday as planned.

Mr. Pompeo was in a meeting with Mr. Trump in the White House when the president wrote the tweets calling off the meeting, a person familiar with the matter said. The president made the decision after talking to Mr. Pompeo and getting an update on the state of negotiations, which have been gridlocked since Mr. Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June.

“I’m not satisfied with the progress,” Mr. Trump said at the meeting with his top diplomat, the person familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Trump appeared to blame China for the lack of progress on the negotiations, even though Beijing doesn’t have a direct role in the process. Officials say progress has stalled because the U.S. wants North Korea to take concrete steps before making any concessions, while Pyongyang wants Washington to reciprocate as it moves toward denuclearization.

Mr. Trump suggested in one tweet that China was no longer cooperating on denuclearization as a way to punish the U.S. over tariffs that have triggered a tit-for-tat trade dispute between the two countries. He said Mr. Pompeo would travel to North Korea after the trade dispute is resolved.

“Because of our much tougher Trading stance with China, I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were,” Mr. Trump wrote.

The U.S. has been calling on China to strictly enforce wide-ranging United Nations sanctions targeting North Korea’s economy. The sanctions were designed to exert painful economic pressure on Pyongyang and drive North Korea’s Mr. Kim to enter into talks over the country’s nuclear program.

Beijing initially appeared to work closely with the U.S. to enforce the U.N. sanctions, but in recent weeks U.S. officials have protested, citing a reported increase in trade between China and North Korea, and they warned that it could ease pressure on Pyongyang to negotiate.

Trade talks between the U.S. and China ended on Thursday without any sign of progress toward a solution. The U.S. put in place tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese goods on Thursday, raising the total to $50 billion. The Chinese have matched them dollar for dollar. The U.S. is eyeing tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese imports, about half the total from China, that could start taking effect as early as September.

China’s Foreign Ministry issued a stern riposte to Mr. Trump’s remarks, saying Beijing has consistently worked toward denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and maintaining regional stability.

“The U.S. statement is contrary to the basic facts and irresponsible. We are gravely concerned,” ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a Saturday statement. All relevant countries should “show more sincerity and flexibility, instead of acting capriciously and blaming others.”

Mr. Pompeo and his newly appointed special representative to North Korea, Mr. Biegun, were due to leave for Pyongyang on Sunday and then travel to Beijing.

It wasn’t immediately clear why Mr. Trump linked China’s lack of help on sanctions to the decision to cancel the talks with North Korea. Administration officials have often said that economic issues related to China and North Korea are kept on separate tracks, even though Mr. Trump sometimes treats them as related.

The purpose of the trip was to introduce Mr. Beigun, who will be taking over responsibility for the talks, and to push Pyongyang to do more to show commitment to its promise to move toward giving up its nuclear weapons.

Mr. Trump has long insisted the talks with North Korea were progressing well, and Friday’s tweets were the first indication that progress was going slower than expected.

Advertisement

As recently as last month, Mr. Trump tweeted that the U.S. was having “many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well!”

South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, in a telephone call with Mr. Pompeo on Saturday, expressed regret over Mr. Pompeo’s delayed visit to North Korea and said all sides should “maintain momentum” of the talks and work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establishing peace, according to a press release from Seoul’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Mr. Pompeo has made several trips to Pyongyang, but talks have been gridlocked over opposing demands. The U.S. wants North Korea to front-load its promises to denuclearize and take concrete steps to dismantle its assets before offering any concessions. North Korea wants the U.S. to make reciprocal, step-by-step concessions as a show of good faith.

Mr. Biegun was appointed to take over the nuclear talks on Thursday, after Mr. Pompeo’s relationship with the North Koreans appeared to sour. North Korea’s foreign ministry described Mr. Pompeo’s approach as “gangster-like” after a visit in July, and avoided a bilateral meeting with the secretary during a regional meeting earlier this month.

Despite the lack of progress at the lower level, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have continued to send each other friendly signals. On Friday, Mr. Trump repeated a previous promise to see Mr. Kim again. The two leaders met at a summit in Singapore in June.

“In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim. I look forward to seeing him soon!,” Mr. Trump said in another Tweet Friday.

The State Department didn’t immediately comment.

"OTTAWA—Canada is challenging the Trump administration’s use of tariffs in a complaint filed with the World Trade Organization, just weeks before crucial talks on revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement get under way in Montreal.

Canada says the complaint, made public Wednesday, is part of “broader litigation” to defend the country’s softwood-lumber producers, which were hit last year with U.S. tariffs of 20% or more. The complaint alleges the U.S. application of tariffs, and their calculation, are “inconsistent” with WTO obligations.

Trade-law experts say Canada’s WTO filing is among the broadest challenges to date against the U.S. practice of imposing countervailing and anti-dumping tariffs against imports it deems to be hurting U.S. industries. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer criticized Canada’s complaint as “ill-advised” and “unfounded,” adding the move “could only lower U.S. confidence that Canada is committed to mutually beneficial trade.”

While softwood is not a subject being addressed in the Nafta talks, some trade watchers said the complaint nonetheless will add tension around discussions when they resume later this month in Montreal.

“This to me is putting an extra finger in the eye” of the Trump administration, said Mark Warner, a trade lawyer who practices in Toronto and New York. “This is a very aggressive move…and I don’t know whether this is the right time to file this particular case.”

Canada has adopted a more pugnacious approach toward President Donald Trump’s administration on trade as Nafta talks have evolved. Canadian officials have said some of the changes the Trump administration wants in Nafta are “wholly unworkable,” most notably on the auto-production side and how disputes are resolved among the Nafta partners.

At the same time, Canadian officials have worked behind the scenes to press their agenda in meetings with members of Congress, state lawmakers and business groups in hopes that influential allies across the U.S. will support keeping Nafta in place.

A report published Wednesday from the Reuters News Agency said Canadian officials are “increasingly convinced” Mr. Trump will withdraw from the continental trade pact after the conclusion of the Montreal round, though the White House later said there has been no change in Mr. Trump’s position. The report weighed on the Mexican peso, and led to a drop in the share prices of General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.

A senior Canadian official said the government has no information suggesting Mr. Trump will imminently follow through on his oft-repeated threat to withdraw from Nafta and said Canada continues to work toward finding common ground with the U.S. and Mexico.

Besides softwood lumber, the U.S. has targeted Canada with tariffs on jetliners made by Montreal-based Bombardier Inc., following a complaint from Boeing Co. ; and on Canadian-made newsprint, in a decision issued Tuesday.

“Canada is taking a run against the entire U.S. trade regime, and it’s sort of carrying the flag for other countries that are getting nailed for these measures,” said John Boscariol, a Toronto-based trade lawyer with McCarthy Tetrault.

Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said Canada’s complaint could be viewed as laying the groundwork for trade with the U.S. should Nafta be terminated.

“It is making the point that if Canada will be treated as an outsider, then this is one way it will have recourse, but it is also hedging against the real risk that Trump may end Nafta as we know it.”

"HELENA, Mont.—Jerry Swick, an Army veteran who currently resides in this mountainous capital city, plans to vote this fall to keep Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in Congress. He just doesn’t know how he would tell that to President Donald Trump, for whom Mr. Swick voted in 2016.

Mr. Trump will host a campaign rally in Big Sky Country Thursday in an effort to corral his supporters behind Matt Rosendale, the Republican state auditor who hopes to quash Mr. Tester’s hopes for a third term.

“I guess if Trump came up to me and asked me to vote for Rosendale, I’d say, ‘Yeah, sure,’ ” said Mr. Swick, who in the 1970s served in the Army Signal Corps. “But then I’d go out and still vote for Tester.”

Mr. Trump and Senate Democrats from states the president won in 2016 will battle this fall over voters like Mr. Swick, who still enthusiastically support the president but may decide to keep their incumbent Democrats in Washington. Mr. Tester is one of 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election this year in states where Mr. Trump beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Republicans currently hold 51 seats in the Senate, compared with 49 controlled by Democrats. The GOP is aiming to pick off a few of the Trump-state Democrats to offset any losses they experience in November so they can protect or expand their caucus. Of the 10 red-state Democrats, four are listed by Cook Political Report as “tossups”; three Republican-held seats are ranked the same way. Mr. Tester’s race is rated as “likely” to remain in the Democratic column.

Many of these vulnerable Democrats plan to keep their Senate seats by positioning themselves as champions of their local constituents rather than trumpeting progressive agenda items such as Medicare-for-all or pledging to “resist” Mr. Trump’s presidency.

For Mr. Tester, that means focusing on public-lands policy and offering entreaties to Montana’s veteran population, one of the largest in the nation. It also means highlighting what Democrats say is perhaps Mr. Tester’s biggest asset: his reputation as a “real Montanan” who years ago lost three fingers in a meat grinder while working on his 1,800-acre dirt farm in Big Sandy, home to fewer than 600 residents.

On Tuesday, Mr. Tester was plowing peas in a field where he will start seeding wheat later this year or in the spring. A third-generation farmer, he typically works 12-hour days in Big Sandy in between voting in Washington and traveling this vast state to meet with constituents.

A “real Montanan,” he said, is someone who “is not phony, somebody who is what they are.”

Republicans argue that no matter how much incumbent Democrats appeal to their states, Mr. Trump is a stronger asset in parts of the country like Montana. Mr. Trump scored a 20-point margin over Mrs. Clinton in Montana, and Republicans expect Mr. Trump to cast Democratic incumbents like Mr. Tester as obstructionists.

The Trump Factor in Senate Races To defend 10 Senate seats they hold in states Trump won, Democrats must break a trend of voters increasingly backing the same party for the Senate and White House.

“He hasn’t really supported the president,” Montana GOP Chairman Debra Lamm said of Mr. Tester. “So I think the tides have turned against him.”

Mr. Tester has voted against legislation pushed by the White House, such as the GOP tax law and efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Tester also voted against Justice Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court and was instrumental in sinking Mr. Trump’s nomination of Dr. Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.

“It shows Republicans who might have voted for Tester in past elections that he doesn’t actually stand with us,” said one GOP operative working to elect Republicans this November. “Just keep in mind the president’s branding in a state like Montana.”

Mr. Tester in the coming months will face another politically risky vote on Mr. Trump’s nominee to succeed retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. But that vote also presents a dicey choice for the White House, as the president is courting Democratic senators from states he won, hoping to draw them over the partisan divide and get his nominee on to the High Court.

When Mr. Trump visits Great Falls on Thursday, he is expected to bring Mr. Rosendale on stage and portray him as vital to advancing the Make America Great Again agenda that swept Mr. Trump into the White House.

“It’ll be interesting to see what he does talk about,” Mr. Tester said of the president’s upcoming visit. Asked if he would be watching the speech, the senator responded: “Hell no,” adding that after participating in a roundtable on trade Thursday, he’d probably be busy on his tractor.

“I doubt Rosendale could change the oil on a tractor,” Mr. Tester said.

The Democrats have dubbed Mr. Rosendale, who is originally from Baltimore, as “Maryland Matt” in attack ads, an effort to juxtapose his background with Mr. Tester’s roots in the state. Mr. Rosendale said the strategy is a deflection from Mr. Tester’s opposition to many cornerstones of the Trump agenda.

“If the people like the agenda that has been put forth by the president, then clearly…they are going to be much more likely to have that become a reality with Matt Rosendale sitting in the U.S. Senate than with Jon Tester,” Mr. Rosendale said in an interview.

On his farm Tuesday, Mr. Tester reflected on his April decision to release a series of startling allegations against Dr. Jackson, the president’s nominee to lead VA who went on to withdraw from consideration. Dr. Jackson denied accusations that he crashed a government car after drinking alcohol, and liberally dispensed prescription drugs, including opioid painkillers and sleep aids.

Mr. Tester, who was criticized by the White House before Dr. Jackson withdrew, has no regrets.

“Bring it,” he said. “I did my constitutional duty on Ronny Jackson.”

The White House said its own review of documents turned up no evidence to support two central allegations that doomed Dr. Jackson’s candidacy, and Mr. Trump called on the senator to resign. “The great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being,” the president tweeted during the April showdown.

Mr. Tester’s allies say the exposure of allegations against Dr. Jackson resonates in Montana as putting the state’s veterans above Mr. Trump.

“I think the key is to always focus on the issues that are most important to your state,” said Sen. Doug Jones (D., Ala.), who won his seat in an upset in a December special election. Mr. Jones has sent out fundraising emails on behalf of Mr. Tester, whom Mr. Jones called “one of my favorites” in the Senate.

“I think Jon wanted to make sure whoever was the next head of the VA was someone who was qualified and not just there because of a friendship or whatever with the president,” Mr. Jones said.

Mr. Swick, the army veteran in Helena, doesn’t see a vote for Mr. Tester as a vote against Mr. Trump—whom he says he would like to see become a two-term president.

“Tester has a track record,” Mr. Swick said, pointing to advocacy for veterans. “I’ve made up my mind.”

BEIJING—China’s mass detention campaign against Muslims in its far west is targeting people who have moved overseas, with Chinese authorities investigating whether members of the Uighur ethnic group are involved in any antigovernment activities.

For more than a year, security officials have told Uighurs living abroad to provide documentation of their overseas activities and to spy and inform on other Uighurs, most of whom are Muslim, according to interviews and chat records reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Other expatriate Uighurs have had their passport renewals denied and instead were offered one-way travel documents to try to force them to return to China.

In many cases, these Uighurs said, authorities are leveraging the government’s detention program, threatening to throw family members still in Xinjiang into the centers, where the U.S. State Department estimates hundreds of thousands have been detained.

Namtulla Najmidin, a 35-year-old computer-engineering student in Norway, said his father called in May last year telling him to expect to hear from the local police. A man identified as a police officer soon followed up, asking for pictures of his passport and Norwegian identification documents.

“Those are my private things. I can’t give it to you,” Mr. Najmidin wrote back on May 18 last year, according to chat logs reviewed by the Journal.

Related Video A Wall Street Journal investigation reveals what goes on inside China's growing network of internment camps, where hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uighurs are believed to have been detained. Screenshot/Video: Clément Bürge

“You’d better think carefully about it,” was the reply. In November, Mr. Najmidin said his father, a 59-year-old cotton farmer without any record of prior arrests or political involvement, was taken to a detention center.

Far from being an afterthought, Uighurs living overseas are a focus of one of China’s largest mass incarcerations in decades. Beijing is concerned that radical Islamic militants are driving a long-running, sporadically violent Uighur separatist movement in Xinjiang, China’s sprawling northwest region. The government sees Uighurs living overseas as potential agents of radicalization.

China’s Foreign Ministry referred questions about targeting Uighurs overseas to other ministries. China’s Ministry of Public Security and State Council Information Office didn’t respond to requests for comment, and the Ministry of State Security, the top intelligence agency, wasn’t reachable for comment. Xinjiang police referred questions to the Xinjiang government, which didn’t reply. Chinese officials have previously denied the existence of detention camps, saying they are vocational training centers, mainly for petty criminal offenders.

Seventeen Uighurs living in the U.S., Britain, Germany, Australia as well as Norway and other countries told The Wall Street Journal they have been pressured by Chinese police and officials.

“Did you carry out illegal activities or not?” a state security agent asked Abdurahman Memet, a 30-year-old Chinese Uighur working as a tour guide in Istanbul, according to a voice message exchange through Chinese chat app WeChat in March last year. “How can I know, if you do not come back?”

Mr. Memet said the man didn’t explain why he needed to return. In one voice message, the agent said: “Your family members are in big trouble if you do not come back.”

A man who answered one phone number used last year to contact Mr. Memet said he was “just a community worker” and said not to call again.

Mr. Najmidin’s chat logs show that a man who contacted him identified himself as a police officer. A woman at a police station in Xinjiang’s Yuli County, where Mr. Najmidin’s father lives, confirmed there was an officer by that name and his work responsibilities include contacting overseas Uighurs. Reached on mobile phone, that police officer said he couldn’t answer questions, adding: “Our job is secret.”

Uighurs see Xinjiang as their homeland. In recent decades, many have gone abroad, mainly for better work prospects but also to escape the government’s tightening controls on religion and what they see as a flood of Chinese into the region.

Some have joined militant movements, with Uighurs turning up in jihadist groups from Afghanistan to Syria. An uptick in knifing and homemade bomb attacks, blamed on Uighur militants, happened in China in 2014. In February last year, a division of the Islamic State in Iraq released a video in which Chinese Uighur militants claimed they would return home to “shed blood like rivers.”

The response has been to swarm Xinjiang with security, swathing the region in a high-tech surveillance network and, in the past two years, building the detention centers that inmates say mix abuse with patriotic indoctrination.

While experts say the threat from a small number of extremists is real, Beijing’s reaction is drawing censure from abroad and warnings that the approach risks alienating many Uighurs generally supportive of the government.

Reyila Abulaiti, a naturalized British citizen, said her 65-year-old mother was taken to a detention center last summer even though she had sent her mother the requested proof of her studies in early childhood development in the U.K. She said her mother, Xiamuxinuer Pida, was a retired engineer for a state-owned petrochemical company with no criminal record.

“Where she has been taken, I have no idea,” she said. “Everyone is scared to communicate with me.”

Wumaerjiang Jiamali, a Uighur living in Sweden, said he was asked to become an informant in order to win his 18-year-old son’s release from a re-education camp. A man who identified himself as a state security agent contacted him this spring, demanding information about Uighurs in Sweden and Turkey, where Mr. Jiamali once lived, according to chat logs and voice recordings reviewed by the Journal.

Wumaerjiang Jiamali, left, a Chinese Uighur living in Sweden, became an informant to secure his 18-year-old son’s release from detention. His son was freed but then redetained in July. Photo: Wumaerjiang Jiamali

“At the time I was really frantic,” Mr. Jiamali said. “I told them that as long as we could get my only son out, there wasn’t anything I wouldn’t do.”

Mr. Jiamali said that after his son’s release, he kept quiet to protect him. Then BuzzFeed recounted Mr. Jiamali’s experience using the pseudonym “O” in July, and his son was detained again. Mr. Jiamali is now willing to use his real name because he thinks authorities have identified him as “O” and keeping quiet will no longer protect his son.

Aynur Ashimajy, a naturalized Australian citizen and activist, said her 71-year-old mother, Saiyidi Ayixiguli, no longer has valid identification in Australia, after the Chinese consulate in Sydney rejected her passport renewal request in January. Ms. Ayixiguli was issued instead a one-time travel permit back to China to apply for a new passport there. Ms. Ashimajy said her mother decided not to return to Xinjiang, fearing she wouldn’t be allowed back overseas.

A staffer at the Chinese consulate in Sydney said Friday that Uighurs could renew passports as usual, but that based on “domestic requirements” or individual “problems,” some might be issued travel documents instead.

Mr. Memet, the tour guide in Turkey, said he met with the same situation at the Chinese consulate in Istanbul last year, when he tried to get a passport for his newborn second son, Fuad. In 2015, Mr. Memet had secured a passport at the consulate for his elder son without incident, he said. This time amid the detention campaign, his younger son was denied a passport but given a one-way travel document valid for three months.

That’s expired, and so Fuad has no legal existence in Turkey, Mr. Memet said. “He can’t even go to the hospital.”

"Nationalism is on the rise across the globe. It is key to Donald Trump’s appeal in the U.S. It is the driving force behind resistance to the European Union and its policies in Britain, Italy, Austria, Poland and Hungary. And it is reflected in the success of Narendra Modi in India, Shinzo Abe in Japan and Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel. Even before considering more complicated examples such as Russia, Turkey and China—whose politics have arguably taken a nationalist turn as well—this constitutes a broad revival of nationalist ideals and aspirations.

Many critics see this revival as the greatest political danger of our time. But it is a mistake to think of nationalism as an inherently regressive or destructive political force. In fact, nationalism was the engine that established modern political liberty, and it has been a spur to diversity among nations. It has been embraced by both liberals and conservatives, including revered figures such as Woodrow Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt, David Ben-Gurion and Mahatma Gandhi, Charles de Gaulle and Margaret Thatcher.

What did all of these leaders see in nationalism that made it so attractive? And if nationalism is, in many respects, genuinely attractive, what can be said about the powerful considerations that are cited against it?

Let’s start with the classic arguments against nationalism. In his essay “Notes on Nationalism” (1945), published weeks after the end of World War II, George Orwell provided a critique of nationalism that is still widely invoked today. Calling nationalism a disordered “habit of mind,” he wrote that nationalists identify solely with a “single nation or other unit,” treat it as beyond moral reproach and recognize “no other duty than that of advancing its interests.”

But Orwell goes well beyond nationalism as the term is usually understood. He takes aim at political extremism on behalf of any collective, including churches, economic classes and “such movements and tendencies as Communism, political Catholicism, Zionism, anti-Semitism, Trotskyism and Pacifism.” At the same time, however, Orwell praises patriotism, which he sees as “devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people.”

George Orwell criticized nationalism but praised “devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life.”Photo: Associated Press

As it happens, this description of patriotism is exactly how most self-identified nationalists describe their own views. When read in context, Orwell’s famous critique of nationalism turns out to be sympathetic to a moderate nationalism.

A more compelling anti-nationalist position was proposed by Elie Kedourie in his 1960 book “Nationalism,” which founded an entire academic movement devoted to analyzing the shortcomings of nationalism. Kedourie, an Iraqi-Jewish scholar who admired the Ottoman and British empires, understood that nationalism is not a mental state. It is a political theory that suggests the world is governed best when it is divided into diverse nations, each having independence and self-government.

Kedourie argued that, though this theory had come to seem self-evident, its actual consequences were “disastrous.” National populations are too mixed to permit agreed-upon borders, and the resulting disputes between nations invariably lead to tension and mutual hatred. Nationalism is “a chain reaction, a vicious circle,” Kedourie wrote, observing that minorities on the wrong side of an international border become “a foreign body in the state” and are persecuted by the majority as it strives either to assimilate or expel them.

Perhaps most important, Kedourie believed that nationalist agitation over borders had precipitated the devastating conflicts of the 20th century. World War I was started by Serbian nationalism, while Hitler’s demand to annex the German populations of Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland “occasioned the outbreak” of World War II.

But the historical record is far more complex than Kedourie allows. World War I began as an Austrian response to Serbian nationalist violence, but it became a vast conflagration due to the conflicting global aspirations of the British, French and German empires. As for World War II, Hitler did not, after all, attack France, Britain and Russia in order to unite the world’s German-speakers. As he wrote in “Mein Kampf,” his aim was to make Germany “mistress of the globe” and “lord of the earth.” This aspiration was not so different from those of the imperial states that Kedourie applauded.

The difficulties of maintaining an international order of independent nations are quite real, but they don’t amount to a case for discarding the national state. In an age of globalized economics, and of international institutions that seem ever more determined to attenuate and replace national independence, it is important to bear in mind the virtues of the national-state framework. In fact, those virtues can help to achieve many political goals shared even by those who favor the disappearance of national distinctions.

Consider the Western tradition of limited government, individual liberty and open elections. Historically, free institutions appeared and persisted in national states such as England, the Netherlands and Scotland—countries built upon a dominant national language and religion, as well as a history of setting aside internal differences to fight common enemies. In “Considerations on Representative Government” (1861), John Stuart Mill argued that it is no accident that free institutions exist in such countries. As he wrote, “It is in general a necessary condition of free institutions that the boundaries of government should coincide in the main with those of nationalities.”

This argument is based on an empirical observation. Limitations on executive authority, achieved by means of competing branches of government and protections for individual rights, have taken root only where a high degree of mutual loyalty and trust exists between rulers and ruled. Similarly, rival tribes will agree to sharing power through democratic institutions only when a powerful “fellow-feeling” or “cohesion” (to use Mill’s terms) has been previously established.

Such political cohesion is rare in arbitrarily assembled human populations. But it can be found in certain human collectives—particularly in families, tribes and nations that share a distinctive cultural inheritance and a history of joint action in the face of adversity. The national state leverages these bonds of mutual loyalty to get individuals to obey the laws, serve in the military and pay taxes, even when their own party or tribe is out of power and the government’s policies are not to their liking.

The United States, with its history of religious and racial diversity, may seem to be an exception, defying the demands of national cohesion. But that isn’t so. The original American states shared the English language, Protestant religion and British legal traditions, and they had fought together in wartime. This shared heritage was strong enough to permit the addition, over time, of other “tribes” to the American nation, including large numbers of Catholic and Jewish immigrants and—in the awful wake of slavery, the Civil War and segregation—African-Americans.

Historically, Americans understood the need to counterbalance this increasing diversity with policies aimed at maintaining a common inheritance rooted in the Anglo-Protestant culture of the founding era. In recent decades, as the country has absorbed ever larger numbers of immigrants from the developing world, the challenge has been to maintain the bonds of mutual loyalty that long held Americans together. It’s not clear that the U.S. is succeeding at this task, which may help to explain the increasing discord in American politics.

National cohesion is the secret ingredient that allows free institutions to exist, the bedrock on which a functioning democracy is built. No wonder, then, that no multinational empire has ever been ruled as a democracy. Lacking mutual loyalty, its respective nationalities see one another only as a threat. That was the case in multinational states such as the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Syria and Iraq. In the long run, nothing holds such states together but coercion. In such cases, lifting the oppression of the state doesn’t bring freedom, only dissolution and civil war.

Of course, this doesn’t mean that every national state will have free institutions and protect individual liberties. But even national states far removed from the West—such as India, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan—have succeeded in imitating the English and American precedents. We are still waiting to see a multinational regime that is able to maintain genuine democracy over time.

Western-style liberties aren’t the only advantage of an order of independent national states. We are familiar with the idea that free competition among private business enterprises spurs innovation that no rational planner could have devised in advance. Less frequently discussed is the fact that the political order is, in this respect, much like the economic order. Diversity and originality are a consequence of competition among independent nations, each developing its own unique constitutional and religious traditions.

The periods in history that we regard as the most creative and productive were characterized by such competition among independent national or city-states. Think of ancient Greece and Israel, or of the Italian states of the Renaissance. In the same way, the centuries of competition among national states in Western Europe released dormant energies, fostering an unparalleled degree of experiment and innovation in government, economics, science, religion and art.

Kedourie is right that national independence is often marred by disputes over where to draw the borders between states. But he overlooks what is beneficial in these arguments. Medieval Europe knew nothing of borders in the modern sense of the term; every ruler added to his dominions to the extent that he was able. The ruinous efforts to conquer France by five generations of English kings during the Hundred Years War (1337-1453) offer a good example of what a world without strong national borders looks like.

The idea that good borders make good neighbors came to the fore only in the 17th century, thanks to debates between Dutch and English nationalists over the nature of international boundaries and how they are established. At first, these debates were solely concerned with drawing stable national borders in Europe—even as these same nations engaged in the often brutal conquest of foreign peoples in Asia, Africa and the Americas. But by the 20th century, the ideal of the independent nation had become the central factor in dismantling European colonial rule around the world, often with the support of American statesmen.

Finally, in our era of growing intolerance, it is important to notice the relationship between the rise of national states and the spread of political and religious tolerance. The Westphalia treaties of 1648, which brought an end to the Thirty Years’ War, marked Europe’s turn away from the ideal of a universal monarchy—a Christian aspiration since Roman times—in favor of a diversity of constitutional and religious arrangements in different states. Henry Kissinger calls this “the Great Moderation” in his 2014 book “World Order.” As he writes, the new state system “took multiplicity as its starting point” and entailed toleration of profoundly divergent views. Catholics had to tolerate Lutheran and Calvinist regimes, monarchists had to tolerate republican regimes, and rulers who tightly regulated their subjects’ affairs had to tolerate regimes affording more extensive liberties.

This formal recognition that diversity among nations is legitimate shattered the old assumption that only one way of life could be correct. Significantly, the Protestant powers negotiating the Westphalia treaties demanded, and in many places secured, freedom of conscience for Protestants in Catholic states. In this way, the toleration adopted by the international system also began to filter into states themselves, eventually attaining the status of a norm in most Western countries.

In certain respects, today’s demands for the imposition of universal standards of speech and belief are a reversion to a pre-Westphalian view of the world. Like universalists of the old school—whether Christian, Muslim or Marxist—the new liberal universalists tend to reject the constitutional, religious and cultural diversity of independent nations. As they see it, the way of life they propose—the downplaying of national distinctions, the unrestricted movement of peoples and goods, the elevation of individual judgment over tradition in all areas of life—will provide what everyone needs. Not surprisingly, the correlate of this rejection of diversity among nations is often a disdain for diversity of viewpoints at home, in one’s own country.

Nationalism has its vices and its extreme expressions. Every nationalist movement contains haters and bigots (though not necessarily more of them than are found in universalist political and religious movements). But nationalism’s vices are outweighed by its considerable virtues. A world in which independent nations are permitted to compete freely with one another is a world in which diverse ways of life can flourish, each an experiment in how human beings should live. We have good reason to believe that such a world holds out the best prospects for freedom, for innovation and advancement, and for tolerance.

"When 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came from nowhere to defeat Rep. Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary for New York’s 14th Congressional District, she became a media darling overnight. Time magazine called her win “the biggest upset of the 2018 elections so far.” Within days Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was appearing on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and “The View.”

Now Republicans looking for their own Ocasio-Cortez think they may have found her. Meet Elizabeth Heng—a Republican running in California’s 16th Congressional District. Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Heng is young (33). Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, she’s a racial minority (Cambodian). And like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, she’s a millennial female running against an established male politician.

What makes her race interesting is California’s “jungle” primary system, in which candidates of all parties run against one another. The top two finishers then face off in November’s general election. California’s 16th is a reliably blue district in a state practically synonymous with the term “blue.” But a funny thing happened on the way to this year’s primary: The virtually unknown Republican woman came within 6% of beating incumbent Democrat Jim Costa in a head-to-head matchup.

In the June primary Ms. Heng received 35,080 votes to Mr. Costa’s 39,527. To put this in perspective, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez received 16,898 votes to Mr. Crowley’s 12,880. And again, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had an easier task, trying to prove she’s the best Democrat in a Democratic district. By contrast, Ms. Heng must persuade Democratic voters to give a Republican a chance.

Ms. Heng isn’t your father’s GOP nominee. In 1983 her parents arrived in the U.S. as penniless refugees from communist Cambodia. She grew up working after school at the little grocery store in Fresno that her family still runs.

A product of Fresno’s public schools, Ms. Heng was valedictorian at Sunnyside High School. She then got her bachelor’s degree from Stanford, where she became student body president. She helped start a string of T-Mobile stores with her brother, earned a master’s in business administration from Yale, and worked for Rep. Ed Royce (R., Calif.) and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She also served on the Trump inaugural committee.

It seems her time spent running a business with her brothers was what drove her into politics. She found the combination of state and federal regulation overbearing. “Instead of focusing on jobs, we were focusing on government regulations,” she told the Fresno Bee. Today she is running as a strong fiscal and deregulatory conservative.

Not everyone is enthralled with Ms. Heng’s background. Twitter and Facebook blocked a campaign video because it contained supposedly offensive images related to the hell her parents had gone through during the killing fields of the Khmer Rouge. Ultimately she forced them to back down, even though neither company gave a good reason why they had banned the video in the first place.

Defeating Mr. Costa will be difficult. As a Blue Dog Democrat, he was one of 28 House Democrats to vote to authorize the Keystone Pipeline. He has name recognition from his years in state and national politics. Oh, yes, he also had raised $1,152,825 as of June 30—more than three times what Ms. Heng has raised.

He also is likely to make an issue of her support for Donald Trump. In this sense, she is the Republican mirror-opposite of Democrats running for office in states Mr. Trump won in 2016. Hillary Clinton carried California’s 16th by 22 points.

But Ms. Heng is nothing if not enthusiastic, and she is making a conservative case against Mr. Costa. She opposes the high-speed railway boondoggle pushed by Gov. Jerry Brown and Mr. Costa. She supports immigration reform. In a district where water is a big issue—and where the Interior Department is now trying to get water to San Joaquin Valley farmers over the objection of state authorities—Ms. Heng might find herself in the stronger position.

Ditto for opportunity. Ms. Heng cites an Almanac of American Politics finding that California’s 16th Congressional District ranks 412th out of 435 in income, making it one of the poorest in the nation. She puts it this way: “America’s booming economy never made it to our district.”

Far from the slash-and-burn attacks of so many candidates, Ms. Heng’s pitch to voters is measured and low-key. But it’s no less devastating. A campaign video has Ms. Heng walking past abandoned houses, homeless people and empty storefronts. She says that for 14 years the district has been represented by “a nice man, Jim Costa”—who has done almost nothing to bring a better life to his constituents.

Ms. Heng remains a long shot. But if there is to be an Ocasio-Cortez surprise in November, California’s 16th is the place.

"Tens of thousands of unaccompanied children and families, mostly from Central America, cross the Mexican border into the U.S. every year, according to Customs and Border Protection. Nearly all of the families and children are applying for asylum, a legal process that could take years because of an immigration court backlog of more than 700,000 cases.

In April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new “zero-tolerance” immigration policy in response to a spike in illegal border crossings in the spring. The overall goal, the Trump administration said, was to slow the number of people crossing the border illegally.

Starting in May, the government began referring every adult who crossed the border to federal prosecutors, which has resulted in the separation of children from their adult guardians.

Before this policy was in place, most families were released into the country with instructions to report back to immigration authorities at a later date. Many of the parents were outfitted with ankle bracelets to monitor their movements. Unaccompanied migrant children were sent to the care of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement.

Here is a look at the numbers:

1. Border Arrests

Arrests along the Mexican border have remained at lows last seen in the early 1970s. The Rio Grande Valley border sector, which includes McAllen and Brownsville, Texas, has been the busiest section of the border in recent years. But since Oct. 1 crossings have increased 17% compared with this time last year, to about 279,000 people, mostly from countries other than Mexico, according to U.S. government data obtained by The Wall Street Journal.

2. Where are they coming from?

Immigrants arrested after crossing the Mexican border are mostly coming from Central America.

3. How many are children?

The number of families and children traveling alone who have been apprehended while seeking refuge in the U.S. has fluctuated over the past few years.

Since the administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy went into effect, Custom and Border Patrol Lead Field Coordinator Brian Hastings said that from May 5 to June 9, they processed 2,235 families who had traveled across the Mexican border, which resulted in the detention of 2,342 unaccompanied minors.

4. How old are the children?

There is no breakdown of ages for those held in child migrants shelters, but looking at the number of unaccompanied children who crossed the border during the 2017 fiscal year, about one in five children were 12 or under, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

5. What is the legal process?

Most of the migrants hoping to stay in the country must wait for their day in immigration court. As of the end of March, the number of cases for all people waiting for a decision reached 700,000, according to the Justice Department.

In many courts, hearings are currently being scheduled beyond 2021 before an available slot on the docket is found, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University. In Houston, cases take an average of 1,751 days—or nearly five years—before their hearing is scheduled to occur.

6. What happens after?

A judge decides if the immigrant can stay in the country or must be deported. The share of deportation orders had been declining since 2011, but started rising in 2017.

"London

Other tourists may remember London for its spectacular sights and history, but I remember it for Islam. When I was visiting the U.K. as a teenager in 2006, I got lost in an East London market. There I saw a group of women wearing head-to-toe black cloaks. I froze, confused and intimidated by the faceless figures. It was my first encounter with the niqab, which covers everything but a woman’s eyes.

This summer, I found myself heading back to the U.K. as it was plunging into a debate over Islamic dress. Boris Johnson, the country’s former foreign secretary and London’s ex-mayor, wrote a column opposing attempts to ban face-covering veils. Nonetheless, he added, “it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes.” The responses could hardly have been more heated.

I wanted to cut past the polemics and experience London’s Muslim communities for myself. My first visit was to Tower Hamlets, an East London borough that is about 38% Muslim, among the highest in the U.K. As I walked down Whitechapel Road, the adhan, or call to prayer, echoed through the neighborhood. Muslims walked in one direction for jumu’ah, Friday prayer, while non-Muslims went the opposite way. Each group kept its distance and avoided eye contact with the other.

Women and girls were dressed in hijabs, niqabs and abayas (robes). Some of the males wore skullcaps and thawbs, Arabic tunics, with their trousers tailored just above the ankles as per Muhammad’s example. The scene could have been lifted out of Riyadh, a testament to the Arabization of Britain’s South Asian Muslims. At the barbershop, women waited outside under the hot sun while their sons and husbands were groomed.

Inside the East London Mosque, visitors were expected to dress “modestly.” Headscarves were provided at reception for any woman who showed up without one. A kind man on staff showed me around the men’s quarters. He gave me a bag filled with booklets about Islam. In one, Muslims are encouraged to “re-establish the Shari’ah,” or Islamic law. Those who ignore this mandate are “of little worth to any society.”

That night, I visited the Houses of Parliament. Rifle-carrying police officers greeted me when I stepped out of the Tube. The extra security was mobilized in response to last year’s car and stabbing attack in Westminster by Khalid Masood, who killed five people. Outside the station, there are roadblocks along Westminster Bridge and a new security fence in front of the palace yard. I asked an officer about Masood’s attack. “I’d rather not talk about it,” he replied. “I was there that day.”

Forty-eight hours later, I woke up to the news that a car had rammed a Westminster security barrier. Police arrested Salih Khater, a 29-year-old Sudanese refugee who had been given asylum and British citizenship. Three people were injured in the attack. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, expressed support for banning vehicles from parts of Parliament Square.

Next I visited Leyton, another district in East London where some Muslim social norms prevail. An Arab cafe near the Tube station was filled with men; no women were inside. An Islamic bookstore sold hijab-wearing dolls for children. The dolls had blank, featureless faces, since human depictions are prohibited in conservative Islam.

I stopped outside the Masjid al-Tawhid, a South Asian Salafi mosque and madrassa (school), just before afternoon prayer time. A group of girls in robes and veils walked around back, toward the dumpsters, where the women’s entrance is located. I later saw the Islamic Shari’a Council of Leyton. This community has religious, educational, business and legal institutions to maintain a separate identity.

All this gave me pause. But I was unprepared for what I would see next in Luton, a small town 30 miles north of London and the birthplace of the English Defense League, which has held unruly anti-Muslim demonstrations. At the Central Mosque, I met a friendly group of Punjabi-speaking young men. “You’ve come to see Luton?” one struggled to ask me in English. The young men asked me to follow them through the town center.

Within minutes, we walked by three other mosques, which were vibrant and filled with young men coming and going.

Girls in hijabs gathered around tables to paint henna designs on their hands. All the businesses had a religious flair: The eateries were halal, the fitness center was sex-segregated, and the boutiques displayed “modest” outfits on mannequins. Pakistani flags flew high and proud. I never saw a Union Jack.

The men finally led me to a discreet building that housed a small Islamic center. They spoke privately to its imam. I was led upstairs to see him. The imam asked me if I was prepared to convert. Apparently there had been some miscommunication with the young men. I told the imam I wasn’t ready for that, but I would appreciate any literature I could take home. He led me to a bookshelf and said I could have whatever I wanted. I grabbed the first booklet that was in English. It was by Zakir Naik, a fundamentalist preacher from India. “The Qur’an says that Hijab has been prescribed for the women,” the booklet explained in one section, “so that they are recognised as modest women and this will also prevent them from being molested.”

"WASHINGTON—Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating former White House national security adviser Mike Flynn’s alleged role in a plan to forcibly remove a Muslim cleric living in the U.S. and deliver him to Turkey in return for millions of dollars, according to people familiar with the investigation.

Under the alleged proposal, Mr. Flynn and his son, Michael Flynn Jr., were to be paid as much as $15 million for delivering Fethullah Gulen to the Turkish government, according to people with knowledge of discussions Mr. Flynn had with Turkish representatives. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has pressed the U.S. to extradite him, views the cleric as a political enemy.

Federal Bureau of Investigation agents have asked at least four individuals about a meeting in mid-December at the ‘21’ Club in New York City, where Mr. Flynn and representatives of the Turkish government discussed removing Mr. Gulen, according to people with knowledge of the FBI’s inquiries. The discussions allegedly involved the possibility of transporting Mr. Gulen on a private jet to the Turkish prison island of Imrali, according to one of the people who has spoken to the FBI.

The Wall Street Journal previously reported on efforts by Turkish officials to get Mr. Gulen to Turkey without going through the U.S. extradition legal process, an effort that included an earlier meeting with Mr. Flynn in September 2016.

The investigation is being handled by Mr. Mueller as part of his probe of Trump campaign advisers and Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to those familiar with the investigation.

A spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment.

The people who described the alleged proposal said they didn’t attend the December meeting and didn’t have direct knowledge from Mr. Flynn or his associates about its purported details. It isn’t clear how advanced Mr. Mueller’s investigation of the alleged plan to remove Mr. Gulen is, nor is there any indication that any money changed hands, according to those familiar with the discussions and the FBI investigation.

But federal investigators’ interest in whether Mr. Flynn was pursuing potentially illegal means to forcibly deal with Mr. Gulen indicates that the former Trump adviser faces another investigation stemming from his work on behalf of Turkish government interests, both before and after the presidential election.

Newsletter Sign-up

After this article was published, Mr. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, called the plot allegations “outrageous and prejudicial,” adding, “they are false.” A lawyer for Mr. Flynn Jr. declined to comment.

Before entering the Trump administration as the president’s national security adviser, Mr. Flynn was lobbying on behalf of Turkish interests in the U.S., including on the Gulen issue. He didn’t disclose that work until March of this year, after he was forced out of the White House for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Mr. Flynn served as national security adviser for just 24 days.

He is now facing military, congressional and criminal investigations into allegations that he improperly concealed his financial ties to Turkey and Russia, and into whether the ties played any role in his decisions as the president’s adviser, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.

One person familiar with the alleged discussions about Mr. Gulen said Mr. Flynn also was prepared to use his influence in the White House to further the legal extradition of the cleric, who lives in Pennsylvania.

Mr. Gulen’s legal residency in the U.S. became a major irritant in American and Turkish relations during the Obama administration, and Turkish officials pressed for Mr. Gulen’s extradition so that he could face charges. Mr. Erdogan’s government has accused the cleric of masterminding a failed coup and have called him and his supporters a terrorist network. Mr. Gulen denies both accusations.

The alleged meeting in New York in December, which came after Mr. Flynn was tapped as national security adviser, was a follow-up to an earlier discussion, on Sept. 19, where Turkish officials first raised the possibility of forcibly removing Mr. Gulen. That September meeting, held in a hotel and attended by former CIA Director James Woolsey, was reported earlier by the Journal.

Ex-CIA Head Woolsey on Flynn, Covert Plan In an exclusive WSJ interview, former CIA Director James Woolsey describes a meeting where Mike Flynn and others discussed a covert plan to move Fethullah Gulen back to Turkey and avoid the U.S. extradition process. (March 27, 2017)

Mr. Gulen’s removal was discussed as “a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away,” according to Mr. Woolsey, who said he attended the meeting at the request of one of Mr. Flynn’s business associates.

Also present at the September meeting were Mr. Erdogan’s son-in-law and Turkey’s foreign minister, foreign-lobbying disclosure documents show. The Turkish Embassy has previously acknowledged that Turkish officials met with Mr. Flynn but declined to discuss the conversation.

A White House spokesman deferred all questions to a spokesman for the Trump transition process.

“We don’t have any evidence that such a meeting took place,” that spokesman said, referring to the December meeting. “And if it did take place it happened not withstanding the transition.”

At the time the plan was discussed, Turkey had been lobbying Obama administration officials for months to release Mr. Gulen to Turkish custody and wanted to avoid a legal extradition proceeding, according to a former official with direct knowledge of Turkish and American discussions. The Obama administration rebuffed those requests, the official said.

In Mr. Flynn, the Turks found a more sympathetic ear. Mr. Flynn wrote an op-ed published in The Hill on the day of the presidential election in which he praised Mr. Erdogan’s government and called the cleric “a shady Islamic mullah” and “radical Islamist” who may be running “a dangerous sleeper terror network” in the U.S.

“We should not provide him safe haven,” Mr. Flynn wrote.

Mr. Woolsey said he informed the U.S. government about the September meeting by notifying Vice President Joe Biden through a mutual friend.

The mutual friend confirmed to the Journal that he told Mr. Biden about the meeting. Mr. Biden’s spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter, other than to say Mr. Biden felt the Gulen matter should be handled through the courts.

Mr. Woolsey, who served briefly as an adviser to the Trump campaign, said he turned down a consulting fee from Mr. Flynn’s company because of what he heard at the meeting.

Federal records show that the company, Flynn Intel Group, was paid $530,000 for advocacy work that “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.”

Federal investigators are currently looking at whether Mr. Flynn’s work on behalf of Turkey violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires people to disclose when they are acting in the U.S. on behalf of foreign powers, according to people with knowledge of the investigation.

Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has been indicted by the special counsel on charges stemming from his work for the former government of Ukraine, which he didn’t properly disclose to U.S. authorities, according to federal charges disclosed last month. Mr. Manafort’s attorney has entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf.

The Journal reported in March that Mr. Flynn had sought immunity from investigators probing Russia’s interference in the presidential election in exchange for his testimony. Mr. Flynn’s attorney, Mr. Kelner, wouldn’t comment at the time on details of his discussions involving Mr. Flynn, but said “General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.”

Mr. Flynn, who was fired in 2014 as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, is a central figure in the sprawling special counsel investigation, which is examining whether Trump campaign or business associates coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to steal private emails from political groups and campaigns and expose them publicly. Mr. Flynn’s contacts with the then-Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, have been scrutinized as part of that probe, according to people with knowledge of the investigation.

President Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia. The Russians have consistently denied interfering in the election.

"A major donor to President Trump agreed to pay $10 million to the president’s then-personal attorney if he successfully helped obtain funding for a nuclear-power project, including a $5 billion loan from the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter.

The donor, Franklin L. Haney, gave the contract to Trump attorney Michael Cohen in early April to assist his efforts to complete a pair of unfinished nuclear reactors in Alabama, known as the Bellefonte Nuclear Power Plant, these people said.

Had he been paid the success fee, Mr. Cohen’s deal with Mr. Haney could have been among the most lucrative of the known consulting agreements he secured after Mr. Trump’s election by emphasizing his personal relationship with the president, according to people familiar with his pitches.

The president has since severed ties with Mr. Cohen, who is under federal investigation in New York in connection with his work for Mr. Trump and private business dealings.

Authorities are investigating whether Mr. Cohen engaged in unregistered lobbying in connection with his consulting work for corporate clients after Mr. Trump went to the White House, according to people familiar with the probe.

Investigators are also examining potential campaign-finance violations and bank fraud surrounding, among other deals, Mr. Cohen’s October 2016 payment to Stephanie Clifford, the former adult-film star called Stormy Daniels, to keep her from discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the probe. Mr. Trump denies any encounter took place.

“Neither Mr. Haney nor Nuclear Development LLC ever entered into a contract with Michael Cohen or his affiliate for lobbying services related to the Bellefonte project,” said Larry Blust, a lawyer for Mr. Haney, referring to the name of the company Mr. Haney is using for the project. He declined further comment about the project or Mr. Cohen.

Mr. Cohen has never registered as a federal lobbyist, public records show.

A representative for Mr. Cohen declined to comment. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Under the contract, Mr. Haney agreed to pay Mr. Cohen a monthly retainer in addition to the $10 million success fee if he could help obtain the funding, including approval of the full amount of the project’s application under a U.S. Department of Energy loan program, the people familiar with the deal said.

Mr. Cohen’s fee would be reduced proportionally if he helped obtain less funding than the contract stipulated, according to a person familiar with the agreement.

A loan application by Mr. Haney’s company is still pending at the Energy Department. Mr. Cohen hasn’t communicated with Energy Secretary Rick Perry about Mr. Haney’s project, according to the Energy Department. Mr. Cohen made several calls to officials at the Energy Department in the spring to inquire about the loan guarantee process, including what could be done to speed it up, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Wall Street Journal couldn’t determine how much Mr. Haney may have paid Mr. Cohen, if anything, in monthly retainer fees.

The agreement was made shortly before Mr. Cohen’s home, office and hotel room were raided by federal agents on April 9, according to the people familiar with the contract. It is no longer in effect, one of them said.

James Thurber, a professor of government at American University, said success fees are “outside the ethical norms” among Washington lobbyists and are frowned upon. Century-old court rulings deemed fees contingent on lobbyists obtaining public funds or killing legislation unenforceable and counter to public policy, saying they encouraged corruption, he said. Several lobbyists contacted by the Journal said $10 million was an unheard-of sum to pay a consultant for government-related work.

There is no blanket federal ban on success fees being included in contracts for Washington lobbyists. And modern courts may be more disposed to such fees now that lobbying is deeply entrenched in law and policy-making and subject to stricter regulation, such as registration requirements, some lobbying experts say.

Manhattan federal prosecutors have contacted some of Mr. Cohen’s other consulting clients, including AT&T Inc. and Novartis AG , the Journal has previously reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Those companies said they paid Mr. Cohen a total of $1.8 million since Mr. Trump took office for his insights into the administration. Both have said he didn’t do any substantial work for them.

Mr. Cohen’s work for Mr. Haney included participating in an April 5 meeting during which he helped the donor pitch the vice chairman of the Qatar Investment Authority, Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim bin Mohamed al-Thani, on a possible investment in the nuclear plant, the Journal reported in May, citing people familiar with the matter.

The meeting took place near Miami Beach, where a Qatari delegation had come to promote business ties with the U.S. Mr. Cohen spent a night on Mr. Haney’s yacht during the trip, one of those people has said.

There is no indication that the Qataris have decided to invest with Mr. Haney. A Qatar spokesman in Washington has confirmed the meeting. A representative of the Qatari sovereign-wealth fund didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Haney’s company, Nuclear Development, entered into a $111 million contract in November 2016 to purchase the partially completed Bellefonte Nuclear Plant from the Tennessee Valley Authority. Mr. Haney has until November to close on the purchase.

A month after the purchase agreement, in December 2016, Mr. Haney donated $1 million to the Trump inaugural fund through a corporate entity, Federal Election Commission records show. He had previously backed mostly Democrats.

Nuclear Development and Mr. Haney’s main company, Franklin L. Haney Co., have spent nearly $1.1 million since the end of 2016 lobbying the federal government and Congress on issues related to nuclear power, according to federal lobbying records.

In a May 14 letter to Mr. Trump reviewed by the Journal, on which Mr. Perry was copied, five members of Congress urged the administration to finish reviewing Nuclear Development’s loan application, describing the project as an engine for economic development.

Dong Kim, chief operating officer for the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office, responded in a letter reviewed by the Journal that the agency would address the application “as quickly as possible, while still performing the necessary due diligence to protect taxpayer interests.”

"The U.S. and Mexico are getting close to reaching a bilateral agreement on key issues holding back a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, removing a hurdle to completing a deal that would eventually include Canada, according to people closely tracking the negotiations.

Trump administration officials and their Mexican counterparts are debating a proposal to exempt some industries from dispute-settlement provisions, which would remove one of the most difficult issues, the people said.

The negotiations have also included discussions over how much local content a car should have, and the cost of labor to produce a car, to qualify for tariff-free treatment under Nafta. The auto-related discussions are at an “advanced” stage, said one official familiar with the matter.

“Our relationship with Mexico is getting closer by the hour,” tweeted President Trump on Saturday morning, as negotiators continued their work. “A big Trade Agreement with Mexico could be happening soon!”

One of the sticking points throughout the last year of Nafta negotiations between the U.S., Mexico and Canada has been Washington’s desire to weaken or remove a provision in Nafta known as investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS, in which companies can bring claims to an international tribunal when they believe their overseas investments were unfairly treated by an action from another Nafta government.

The U.S. has argued that the tribunals erode national sovereignty. But many U.S. companies have pressured the administration to preserve the dispute-settlement provisions, arguing that otherwise their international investments would be exposed and unprotected. Mexico and Canada have also favored keeping the provisions, believing they bolster the confidence of investors.

The Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, National Association of Manufacturers, and American Petroleum Institute are among major industry groups that have fought to preserve the dispute-settlement provisions.

An idea to resolve the impasse is for only certain industries to remain covered by dispute settlement. Negotiators have floated the idea with different industries, according to three sources from industries closely tracking the negotiations. Mexico and the U.S. don’t appear to have reached an agreement on the idea to exempt some industries but not others.

While a compromise on dispute settlement may bring some industry groups along, it could spark further opposition from the exempted industries that believe they are losing meaningful protection of their international investments. The strategy could split the united front that many business groups have advanced, with some major industries potentially welcoming a resolution, leaving behind a smaller group with objections.

The U.S. Trade Representative’s office didn’t respond to a request to comment. Mexican officials, approached as they entered a negotiating venue in Washington, declined to comment.

One idea that has been discussed is to retain industries that bid for government concessions as a crucial part of their business, including energy, utilities, mining, telecoms and services under the dispute-settlement process. Other major industries, including manufacturing and agriculture, wouldn’t be covered by the dispute-settlement provisions in this version of the proposal.

Mexico and the U.S. have signaled in recent days that they are making significant progress in resolving their remaining disagreements. But they have stressed nothing is final. Talks are set to continue over the weekend.

One source of delay could be a rift emerging between the current Mexican negotiating team, and that of President-elect Andrés Manuel Lòpez Obrador, who wants Mexico’s newly opened energy sector to be exempt from dispute resolution.

Geoffrey Gertz, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied dispute settlement, said that the system is more important for some industries than others.

“There is a logic to focusing on industries with high sunk costs and extensive regulation, as this is where investors are potentially most exposed to reversals in government policy,” he said.

But companies that aren’t covered might still be convinced to support the deal if it allows the Nafta negotiations to be resolved, he said.

“What I suspect matters most for firms considering investing in Mexico is stable, predictable, comprehensive access to the North American market, more so than the right to bring ISDS cases,” said Mr. Gertz.

Even if the U.S. and Mexico agreed to only retain dispute settlement for certain industries, Mexico and Canada could still agree bilaterally to keep the provisions for all their industries.

Mexico’s chief trade negotiator, Ildefonso Guajardo, said Friday that the U.S. and Mexico are “very far” down the list of issues needing to be worked out between the two countries, but said “even if you are extremely engaged, there is always a last-moment thing that can come between you and your goals.”

He said conclusion of the talks, including some of the most difficult remaining issues, would require the inclusion of the Canadians.

Asked about the U.S. position that Nafta should include a “sunset clause” which causes the deal to expire in five years, Mr. Guajardo responded that “it’s clear that there are trilateral issues that have to be solved in a trilateral context.”

"A Saudi-led military coalition said Saturday it made mistakes in an airstrike last month that killed dozens of Yemeni schoolchildren, a rare admission of guilt for the U.S.-backed alliance.

The coalition, which is fighting a war against Yemen’s Iran-supported Houthi rebels, apologized for the strike and promised to hold accountable those responsible, pending the official findings from a Saudi-based investigatory body, according to a statement.

The coalition would also revise its rules of engagement “in a manner that guarantees non-recurrence of such incidents,” it said.

Saudi Arabia and its mainly Arab allies have carried out airstrikes and a ground campaign in Yemen for more than three years in a bid to oust the Houthis, who hold power in the capital San’a. They want to restore the internationally backed government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.

But as the human toll mounts, the U.S.-backed coalition’s airstrikes have come under intensifying scrutiny from human-rights groups, the United Nations and Washington. The conflict overall has killed more than 6,660 civilians, according to the U.N., a large portion of them allegedly by coalition strikes.

The coalition has admitted fault following investigations before, as it did in 2017 when it said a “technical mistake” was responsible for a strike that killed over a dozen people in San’a. But such admissions are unusual.

The one on Saturday followed growing political pressure on the coalition from political figures in the U.S., which sells many of the precision weapons the coalition uses in its strikes and provides vital aerial refueling to coalition warplanes.

Several congressional efforts to stop or reduce that support have sprung up in the past year. Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) last week repeated a call for an end to U.S. support for the coalition.

“There is simply no way our participation in this cataclysm of civilian deaths is making our country more safer,” he said. “The world is seeing what we are doing in Yemen, and they wonder what America stands for anymore.”

The strike on Aug. 9 that hit a school bus in Yemen’s northern Saada province, a Houthi stronghold that borders Saudi Arabia, drew a particularly virulent response from critics. Some 40 children were killed in the attack as their bus drove through a market in the town of Dhahyan, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Adding to the furor over the coalition’s handling of the war, a U.N. report found last week that members of the coalition and its allied forces may be guilty of war crimes due to alleged torture, child-soldier recruitment and attacks on civilians.

The coalition dismissed the report Wednesday, calling it biased and saying allegations of the coalition’s targeting of civilians were false.

Defense Secretary James Mattis said last week that the U.S. hadn’t seen Saudi Arabia showing “callous disregard” for Yemeni civilians. Yet he also said U.S. support wasn’t unconditional.",world
"President Trump continued his criticism for a second straight day that Google’s search engine is biased against conservatives, while saying he prefers not to pursue regulation of the internet giant.

Mr. Trump posted a video to Twitter on Wednesday that showed Google’s home page promoted live broadcasts of former President Barack Obama’s State of the Union addresses on YouTube but didn’t extend those promotions to Mr. Trump’s speeches before Congress.

The post, which included the hashtag #StopTheBias, followed Mr. Trump’s claim Tuesday that Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., GOOGL -1.80% surfaces news and search results that are unfavorable to himself and other conservatives because of what he sees as the company’s left-leaning bias—which Google denied. Mr. Trump in a series of tweets Tuesday signaled potential government action if Google didn’t change its alleged practices.

The president reiterated the bias claim Wednesday, telling reporters at the White House he would like to see Google, along with Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc., treat conservatives more fairly. “They are really trying to silence a very large part of this country and those people don’t want to be silenced,” Mr. Trump said. “You know what we want? Not regulation, we want fairness.”

A White House official said the president has made clear he wants his administration to look into the issue, and several officials were tasked with finding options for potential action against social-media companies.

Google said this week that its search results don’t reflect any political ideology and it never ranks results to manipulate political sentiment.

The company on Wednesday also disputed the claim in Mr. Trump’s tweet regarding State of the Union addresses. A Google spokeswoman said Wednesday that the company did highlight the live stream of Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address on Jan. 30. She said Google promoted neither Mr. Trump’s speech to Congress in February 2017 nor Mr. Obama’s in February 2009 because the first such speech by a new president isn’t considered a State of the Union address.

Archived versions of Google’s home page on Internet Archive, a nonprofit that preserves historical snapshots of webpages, appear to show Google.com promoting Mr. Trump’s State of the Union at certain points during this year’s speech and not at others. Several snapshots of the page that day don’t show promotion of Mr. Trump’s speech. Google declined a request to provide a screenshot showing promotion of this year’s speech.

Mr. Trump on Wednesday also mentioned his interest in a congressional hearing scheduled for Sept. 5, when executives including Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg are scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about election interference.

Kent Walker, Google’s senior vice president for global affairs, planned to join the hearing. But last week, Sen. Richard Burr (R., N.C.), who heads that committee, said he had rejected Google’s offer to send Mr. Walker, apparently in an effort to force a more senior executive to appear.

"LEXINGTON, Ky.—When Lou Hurst heads to the polls this November, two issues will be at the top of her mind as she casts her vote in the 2018 midterm election: the economy and health care.

While she acknowledges that a low unemployment rate and other indicators point to a strong economy, Ms. Hurst said she is worried about wealth inequality and stagnant wage growth. She also is concerned that Republicans, if they keep total control of Congress, would again try to repeal or gut the Affordable Care Act.

“Health care is huge for me,” said the 39-year-old, who works at a Lexington nonprofit and usually votes for Democrats. “I am really wary and upset about any attempts to undermine Obamacare, which we have for now. That’s my main concern.”

Control of the House could hinge on voters like Ms. Hurst, who said she doesn’t usually vote in midterm elections. This year, she plans on voting for Democrat Amy McGrath, a retired Marine pilot who is challenging Republican Rep. Andy Barr in one of the most contested races in the country.

For many voters, health care and the economy, as well as immigration, are the most important issues at stake in the midterms, according to a July Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. Their views of President Trump are also influencing how they plan to vote.

Leslie McCain, a Republican and retired teacher who lives in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District, where GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock is considered vulnerable in her race against state Sen. Jennifer Wexton, said she supports Mr. Trump’s policies and wants Congress to remain Republican and pass immigration legislation.

“We need to get the immigration issue taken care of,” she said. “I want a wall built. I want to quit giving money to all the illegals.”

Immigration policy—already a key issue after several unsuccessful GOP attempts at a major immigration overhaul—catapulted to the top of the national agenda when the Trump administration’s policy of separating children from their parents at the border unleashed criticism from both parties.

“There should be a need to think about all kinds of people in the country, and even world-wide,” said Mirza Ali, a 73-year-old Pakistani immigrant who is now a naturalized citizen in Bristol, Va. “Given the present government’s attitude and its work, I would never vote Republican. I will vote for Democrats.”

As Democratic candidates focus on health care, Republicans are touting a low unemployment rate and the tax bill passed at the end of 2017, based on their advertising. But for voters, those GOP accomplishments can be overshadowed by Mr. Trump and controversies surrounding his administration.

Rebecca Kegley, who lives in Kentucky’s Sixth District, where Ms. McGrath is challenging Mr. Barr, said she has “mixed feelings” heading into the November election.

“I like what’s happening with the economy, the job rate is really low. It’s probably the lowest it’s been in a really long time,” said Ms. Kegley, who didn’t want to say how she might vote. “I could really do without the rhetoric, the unprofessionalism, the impulsiveness. Those concern me.”

Gloria Gbatu, of Manassas Park, Va., says the economic recovery still has a way to go. “I see how things are,” said Ms. Gbatu, who didn’t want to disclose any political affiliation. “It’s a little bit better than before, but we don’t know if it’s stable.”

Richard Vimont, an attorney in Lexington, Ky., and a registered Democrat, said he wants to see Congress check the president. “The Republicans have control of both houses, and they seem to not be willing to stand up to the president,” he said. “I think the president has put in a lot of policies that will be detrimental to the well-being of this country.”

Dick Harshberger, who lives in Radford, Va., and said he is an independent, wants Republicans to keep control of Congress so they can enact Mr. Trump’s agenda. He said he wants Congress to ratify new trade agreements and confirm Supreme Court nomineeBrett Kavanaugh, who may be confirmed before the election.

“I don’t agree with everything that President Trump does and says, but overall I think he’s getting an awful lot done that needs to get done,” said Mr. Harshberger, who said he is in his 80s.

Nikki Fast Pollock, an insurance professional in Lexington, Ky., and a Democrat, said women’s issues played an important role in shaping her decision to vote for Democrat Ms. McGrath.

“There really aren’t a lot of good options in Kentucky for a woman who is a liberal thinker,” she said. “Our candidates don’t seem to understand that we live in 2018 and not 1960.”

Disdain for national Democratic figures has also galvanized some conservative voters. Thomas Gates, who has lived in Leesburg, Va., since 1974, said he doesn’t want to see people he called “liberal lunatics” like Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi back in power.

Other voters, such as George McKay, from Nokesville, Va., say they have been motivated to vote Republican because of the criticism of Mr. Trump.

“I think Trump’s doing a great job,” the 74-year-old independent said, listing a strong economy and Mr. Trump’s foreign policy as positive accomplishments. “The Democrats have lost their minds. Democrats are advertising this big blue wave, and I think it’s going to be the other way around.”",politics

"In more than 40 tweets this year, President Trump has praised tariffs for making Americans richer, reducing trade and budget deficits and restoring U.S. prestige.

“Only fools would disagree,” he tweeted in August.

He also calls himself a free trader who wants to eliminate tariffs altogether as well as industry subsidies and non-tariff trade barriers across countries.

“No tariffs, no barriers. That’s the way it should be,” Mr. Trump said at a press conference after Group of Seven meetings in June.

Is that no-tariff objective serious after all that Mr. Trump has said in favor of them?

Probably not. As recent talks with Europe help show, most nations have industries they are determined to protect—including the U.S.—which makes it hard even for the most ardent free traders to level the global trading field completely. It is one reason the global trade deals that do exist are so complex and often uneven, and why they are likely to stay that way.

Advertisement

The U.S. initially pushed the zero-tariff line in recent talks with Europe, but both sides quickly watered it down.

The U.S. insisted that automotive trade be exempted from the talks, even though the U.S. is pushing Europe to eliminate its car tariffs and has threatened tariffs as high as 25% on European car imports, if they don’t.

The reason vehicles aren’t in the talks: The U.S. auto industry itself relies on 25% tariffs to protect U.S. trucks from import competition, and the Trump administration wanted to preserve that. The European Union, on the other hand, blocked U.S. efforts to consider agricultural subsidies because it wanted to preserve the Common Agricultural Policy, which relies on subsidies. Also off the table: U.S. “Buy America” provisions, which block foreign firms from government contracts.

Negotiators are now largely talking about reducing tariffs on industrial products, which is the usual starting point of most trade deals. But the economic gains of going to zero would be small because tariffs are already low. The average U.S. manufacturing tariff is 2.4%, compared with the EU’s 2.6%.

The zero-zero proposal springs from work done by Larry Kudlow before he was appointed National Economic Council director earlier this year. He and two free-trade economists—Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation and Arthur Laffer, a Reagan administration adviser, sought ways to make their views jibe better with Mr. Trump’s belief that trade makes some countries winners at the expense of others, says Mr. Moore.

Advertisement

They latched on to the 2018 Economic Report of the President, which showed that the U.S. had among the lowest tariffs among major trading nations. Zero tariffs would make the U.S. a winner, they argued, because other countries would have to make bigger cuts than the U.S. As NEC director, Mr. Kudlow pushed that line.

In a spring White House discussion with trade advisers, Trump trade hawk Peter Navarro objected, arguing that zero tariffs weren’t sufficient to level the playing field, said individuals familiar with the discussions. The U.S. also needed to push for zero subsidies, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation and value-added taxes, Mr. Navarro argued, because other countries used those tools to their advantage. The advisers agreed to push for three zeros: tariffs, subsidies and non-tariff barriers.

At the G-7 summit in June Mr. Trump pitched the idea, which was overshadowed by a public feud with the host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and then a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The following month, the proposal resurfaced in talks with Europeans.

Though hard to achieve in practice, the zero-tariff initiative still plays a role in U.S. negotiating strategy. In the U.S.-Europe talks, it helped ease relations, which had been strained by U.S. tariffs on EU steel and aluminum exports. The U.S. has pledged to not go ahead with tariffs on European cars as long as the two sides are negotiating. The two sides met in Washington on Aug. 20 for follow-up talks where the zero-tariff initiative remained on the table, said an EU official.

Advertisement

Similarly, the zero-tariff plan could give the U.S. a way to re-engage with trading partners who have dismissed the Trump administration as hopelessly protectionist. “It gives the U.S. the moral high ground,” says Mr. Moore.

If the U.S. cuts deals with allies like the EU, Canada, Mexico and Japan, the Trump administration could then focus on China. Administration trade hard-liners and free-traders alike have been frustrated that fights over steel, aluminum and other issues have made it tougher to mount a coordinated Western offensive against China.

When it comes to China, a push toward zero tariffs and subsidies could produce some clear wins for the U.S., given China’s much greater level of protection. Chinese industrial tariffs, for instance, average 12.1%, the Council of Economic Advisers reports. Cutting them to zero—or at least a lot lower—could be a big win for the U.S.

Getting China to accept dropping all subsidies and other discrimination against foreign firms—now that would be a real long shot.

"WASHINGTON—The Trump administration has rejected an effort by Turkey to tie the release of a U.S. pastor with relief for a major Turkish bank facing billions of dollars in U.S. fines, telling Ankara other issues are off the table until the minister is freed, a senior White House official said.

The jailing of Andrew Brunson has triggered the worst crisis between the two countries in decades and helped push the Turkish currency to record lows in recent months. The rejection of a possible trade sets the stage for the U.S. to impose another round of penalties against Ankara as soon as this week.

The administration wants Turkey to release Mr. Brunson and other citizens it holds on disputed terrorism charges, as well as three Turkish nationals who work for the U.S. government.

Turkey, seeking a gesture in exchange, asked the U.S. to drop an investigation into Halkbank , which is facing potentially crippling fines for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.

The White House official said the U.S. made clear to Turkey that areas of dispute between the two nations, including the fines Halkbank faces, won’t be discussed until Mr. Brunson has been released.

“A real NATO ally wouldn’t have arrested Brunson in the first place,” the senior White House official said, referring to Turkey’s membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The Trump administration imposed sanctions against two top Turkish officials earlier this month, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. was prepared to take tougher steps.

On Friday, President Trump called the charges against Mr. Brunson “phony,” adding: “We are not going to take it sitting down.”

The U.S. and Turkey have been in prolonged negotiations over a major fine against Halkbank, but the talks stalled. Halkbank is also facing further investigation in the U.S.

Halkbank recently complied with a subpoena request from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets and Control, but its response was deemed insufficient, the White House official said. Washington has told Ankara that Halkbank must comply properly with the U.S. legal process before any discussions about relief could be entertained, the official said.

A Treasury spokesman declined to comment.

The Turkish embassy in Washington didn’t respond to a request for comment. Halkbank couldn’t be reached for comment. The Turkish government has said accusations that Halkbank helped Iran evade U.S. sanctions are groundless and based on fabricated documents.

The bank, formally known as Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S., is one of Turkey’s largest state lenders. It has denied any wrongdoing.

Other points of dispute between the two nations include Turkey’s retaliation against U.S. exports after the Trump administration placed tariffs on imported aluminum and steel. The U.S. Trade Representative’s Office has also started a review of Turkey’s duty-free access to U.S. markets.

Mr. Brunson, a 50-year-old North Carolina native, has been accused by Turkish officials of aiding the group accused of orchestrating a failed July 2016 military coup and another group of Kurdish separatists battling the Turkish military for greater autonomy. He has been held since October 2016.

Mr. Brunson’s fate—he is now held under house arrest—has been a major cause for evangelical Christians and a priority for Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

The White House official discussed other national security issues as well, saying there was skepticism at the highest level of the White House about Russia’s ability to help remove Iranian forces from Syria. That ran counter to Mr. Trump’s optimistic tones after his Helsinki summit with President Vladimir Putin of Russia last month that Moscow and the U.S. would be able to work jointly on the issue.

Syria was the longest subject of discussion between Messrs. Putin and Trump when they and their top advisers met, the official said. The Russian president said during private meetings that he didn’t want the Iranians in Syria either, but he wasn’t sure Russia was able to achieve that, the official said.

John Bolton, the White House national security adviser, said Sunday on ABC that Mr. Putin told the president he “didn’t have the same interest as Iran in Syria, and that he’d like to talk about ways to get them [Iran] out.”

“President Putin is very candid in his comments to President Trump, he was to me as well,” Mr. Bolton said.

Mr. Bolton said he plans to discuss the situation in Syria when he meets with Israeli and Russian leaders this week.

"There are several questions about President Trump’s financial dealings that Allen Weisselberg might be uniquely positioned to answer.

Mr. Weisselberg, Mr. Trump’s longtime accountant and the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, would be in a good position to know if Mr. Trump is actually a billionaire and how much he paid in taxes. Mr. Weisselberg may also know who holds stakes in Mr. Trump’s real-estate holdings or other business lines. And whether Mr. Trump authorized payment to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

Now Mr. Weisselberg provided information to prosecutors working on at least one of several investigations orbiting Mr. Trump.

The news Friday that federal prosecutors had granted Mr. Weisselberg immunity and that he had testified before a grand jury in the investigation into Michael Cohen , Mr. Trump’s former lawyer, underscores the critical role accountants and CFOs play in criminal prosecutions.

“They’re often the key witness for the prosecution in putting a case together that has a financial element to it,” said Widge Devaney, a former federal prosecutor, who is co-chair of the Global Compliance & Investigations group at law firm Baker & McKenzie LLP.

Finance chiefs manage the books, know the state of the balance sheets, the business relationships driving deals and the parties funding new partnerships. They also know the provenance of payments received, how that money is used and—if they are good—why.

They also are often involved in the creation or management of an organization’s holding companies. Real-estate developers in particular tend to own portfolios or individual properties in separate limited liability companies. It is common for a finance chief to understand the nature of these entities and how money flows between them, their partners and a parent corporation.

The 71-year-old Mr. Weisselberg first worked for Fred Trump, the president’s father, rising to the position of controller at the Trump Organization by the late 1980s, as previously reported by CFO Journal. Over the years, he advanced to the post of CFO and executive vice president of the Trump Organization and serves as treasurer at the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which is under investigation by New York state authorities.

Mr. Weisselberg also oversaw President Trump’s personal finances and tax returns, a role that expanded after the 2016 election when Mr. Trump handed control of his financial interests to Mr. Weisselberg alongside his adult sons, The Wall Street Journal reported. Mr. Trump’s tax returns have been a focus for his critics, who point out he has bucked decades of tradition of transparency among presidents and presidential candidates.

A spokesman for the Trump Organization declined to comment.

Mr. Weisselberg’s decades of proximity to Mr. Trump and his finances mean he might be able to guide prosecutors through complex transactions, identify the parties in LLCs and tie payments to senders and recipients, lawyers and accountants said.

“You need to talk to the accountant when the books aren’t accurate, or you think the accountant knows something about the transaction… that’s not in the paperwork,” said Ryan Rohlfsen, a partner at law firm Ropes & Gray LLP and former federal prosecutor.

Mr. Weisselberg was mentioned on a tape Mr. Cohen secretly made during a September 2016 meeting with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen spoke with Mr. Trump about purchasing the rights to a former Playboy model’s story of an affair with Mr. Trump, according to the recording, which is being reviewed by federal prosecutors. Mr. Cohen said he planned to create a company to make the payment, adding “I’ve spoken with Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up.”

Prosecutors’ decision to grant immunity to Mr. Weisselberg reflects his value to their case, former federal prosecutors said. A request to grant immunity must go to the criminal division at the Justice Department and must be approved at a very high level.

And there is no legal privilege that would shield such communication from criminal subpoenas or civil litigation, such protection only extends to attorneys who are providing legal advice.

“If a CFO, a treasurer or comptroller or even a CEO is privy to communications or facts, none of that is protected from disclosure to either government investigators or to outside lawsuits in the discovery process,” said Joseph Moreno, an accountant, former federal prosecutor and partner at law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP. “People are often surprised by that, because people think business communication is privileged, and it’s not.”

CFOs questioned by prosecutors will be required to speak and tell the truth, unless they invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination, lawyers and former prosecutors said. That right is typically waived in an immunity deal, lawyers said.

CFOs often attract scrutiny when something goes wrong at an organization, particularly when investigators probe whether controls and procedures were applied.

But as the CFO of a private company, Mr. Weisselberg didn’t have to meet the same level of fiduciary responsibility to speak up as is expected of a public company finance chief, said Aaron Beam, the former CFO of HealthSouth Corp., who was jailed for his role in the company’s accounting scandal.

“When you’re working for a family, you really don’t have that responsibility to call the family out and say, ‘I don’t think you’re spending money wisely,’” said Mr. Beam, who now consults on corporate ethics. “In fact it would be very bizarre for you to get involved in family stuff.”

DUBLIN—As Ireland prepares to welcome its first papal visit in four decades when Pope Francis arrives Saturday, it is a much changed and less Catholic country. But in one key respect, the Ireland of 2018 is as it was in 1979: The vast majority of its children are educated in Catholic schools.

In the years since millions came out to see Pope John Paul II, contraception and divorce have become legal, as has same-sex marriage, while a ban on abortion added to the constitution in 1983 was removed after a referendum this May.

Although the adult world has altered almost beyond recognition, the world of childhood remains largely the same. The bulk of primary school pupils still receive instruction in the principles, doctrines and narratives of the Catholic faith.

That is a path followed by the vast majority of Irish people since the primary school system was constructed in the second half of the 19th century, encouraging many people until recently to regard Catholicism as an essential marker of Irishness.

But growing numbers of Irish parents are now seeking an alternative to the Catholic system. Orla Matthews lives in Leixlip, a small but expanding town in County Kildare, on the edges of Dublin. Her 4-year-old son Faolán will start primary school in September 2019, and she is hoping that a new school due to open in the town will be nonreligious.

Having received a Catholic education, the 40-year-old digital strategist became an atheist in her mid-20s. Revelations from 2012 onward about the historic mistreatment of unmarried mothers and their children in institutions run by the Church, following earlier evidence of widespread sexual abuse of children by priests, reinforced her determination to seek a non-Catholic education for her child.

“With the scandals that have come out about the Catholic Church, I don’t want that organization anywhere near my child’s education,” she said.

Her other objection to the existing system is that it no longer reflects Irish society. In the 2016 census, the share of people identifying as Catholic had fallen to 78% from 93% in 1981, while weekly attendance at Mass has slipped more sharply. In 2017, barely half of all marriages were celebrated inside the church, compared with 78% as recently as 2001.

Related Video The people of Ireland on May 25 voted in a referendum on whether to repeal its ban on abortion, one of the most bitterly contested battlegrounds in the country. For both sides, it has been more than a debate about abortion rights—it was a battle over health care, human rights, identity and values. WSJ's Niki Blasina reports.

“The schools at the moment don’t reflect the mix of the area,” she said. “We want them to be more reflective of the Ireland that we know today. We’re a different country. We’re just not all Catholic anymore.”

Declining religiosity is only one of the big changes to have taken place here over recent decades. For centuries, Ireland was a country that sent people overseas. But in 1996, it became a net importer of people for the first time, and that is expected to continue.

“That has led to a multicultural Ireland that is out of sync with the primary school system,” said Daniel Faas, an associate professor of sociology at Trinity College Dublin. “It’s creating parental pressure on the state to look at this.”

Paddy Monahan became a father for the first time in 2015, an event that focused his attention on the fact that local schools, all of which were Catholic, could reject applicants who hadn’t been baptized as Catholics in favor of those that had, even if they lived further away.

“I realized with a crash that my boy, who is not baptized, could have a problem getting in to one of these schools,” he said.

Then a lawyer, Mr. Monahan launched a petition that called for the removal of the “Baptism barrier,” which quickly gained the support of thousands of signatories and helped persuade the government to pass a law in July that means the first intake of children who can’t be selected on a religious basis will start school in September 2019. Mr. Monahan now works for the campaigning group Education Equality.

Even if entry to school can no longer be decided on religious grounds, the system requires a hefty commitment to religious education. The government’s suggested minimum time allocated to this subject is two-and-a half hours a week, although individual teachers and schools often disregard that guidance and children can opt not to take part.

Ireland isn’t unique in allowing the teaching of a particular religion in its primary schools. What distinguishes it from the rest of Europe is that more than 90% of its schools are owned by the Catholic Church. The state pays most running costs, including teacher salaries, but ownership of the buildings and land gives the Church patronage, or the right to decide what the government terms a school’s “ethos.”

With demands growing for a more diverse system of education, the government launched its first effort to speed the handover of Catholic schools to other groups in 2012. The program made little progress, complicated by laws regarding ownership, and the government began a reboot of the effort in May.

The Catholic Church says it welcomes the move toward greater diversity, and says change has been slow because many local communities are happy with the education their children receive. The Irish school system performs above average in international comparisons, while being much better at teaching literacy skills than math or science.

“What we would very much want is those who attend our schools want to be there, and want the ethos,” said Bishop Brendan Kelly, chairman of the Irish Episcopal Commission’s education group.

With school transfers limited, much of the change is being driven by the opening of new schools for a growing population. Bishop Kelly said the church is unlikely to seek patronage of new schools.

The government’s goal is to have 400 multidenominational and nondenominational schools by 2030, or 13% of the total. The leading alternative system is run by a not-for-profit body called Educate Together. It now has 82 schools, and aims to add many more.

“The pace of change is lagging way behind the demand for change,” said Paul Rowe, Educate Together’s chief executive officer.

"In 1935, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected President Franklin Roosevelt’s bid to fire a Federal Trade Commission member appointed by President Herbert Hoover, his immediate predecessor.

Judge Brett Kavanaugh, now President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, has signaled he would like to overturn the precedent set in the case, Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S.

The case has come up repeatedly in Judge Kavanaugh’s writings as a misguided dilution of the president’s power over the executive branch.

William E. Humphrey died before the case bearing his name was decided. Photo: Library of Congress

In a 2008 dissent, he acknowledged that lower courts had no power to overrule a Supreme Court precedent, but argued that judges shouldn’t extend the Humphrey case’s reasoning to panels structured differently than the FTC, such as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, an agency Congress created in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to prevent corporate accounting scandals.

The accounting board members were even more insulated from removal than officials at other independent agencies, he said, making them unaccountable to the public.

The two judges in the majority–the liberal Judith Rogers and the conservative Janice Rogers Brown–dismissed Judge Kavanaugh’s approach.

“The absolutes that the dissent postulates—essentially, either the President must have at-will removal power or Congress has acted unconstitutionally”—are simplistic, Judge Rogers wrote for the majority.

But by a 5-4 vote along conservative-liberal lines, the Supreme Court in 2010 adopted Judge Kavanaugh’s view, making board members removable at will by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Throughout his time on the bench, Humphrey’s Executor and related precedents he considers erosions of presidential authority have never been far from Judge Kavanaugh’s mind.

He alone raised the issue in a 2009 case involving royalty rates that satellite radio services pay to broadcast musical recordings, which were set by a board appointed by the librarian of Congress.

“Billions of dollars and the fates of entire industries can ride on” decisions of board members neither nominated by the president nor confirmed by the Senate, he wrote, suggesting that the Copyright Royalty Board could be unconstitutional. He was vindicated three years later, when the D.C. Circuit in a different case ruled the structure violated the Constitution.

Two years later, he brought the issue up in litigation over nuclear-waste storage at Nevada’s Yucca Mountain. President Obama wanted to kill the project, Judge Kavanaugh observed, but lacked the final say because Congress assigned authority to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. NRC appointees can be removed for corruption or incompetence, but not solely because the president disagrees with their decisions.

The NRC and similar agencies “have huge policymaking and enforcement authority and greatly affect the lives and liberties of the American people,” Judge Kavanaugh wrote. “Yet those independent agencies are democratically unaccountable—neither elected by the people nor supervised in their day-to-day activities by the elected President.”

After his landslide victory in 1932, President Roosevelt asked Commissioner William Humphrey, a Hoover appointee, to resign. It was nothing personal, President Roosevelt wrote, but he thought his agenda “can be carried out most effectively with personnel of my own selection.”

The commissioner declined Mr. Roosevelt’s increasingly insistent requests he resign, ignored an October 1933 letter dismissing him, and filed suit to keep collecting his salary. Mr. Humphrey died a few months later, but his estate kept litigating for back pay.

The Supreme Court, then controlled by conservatives who repeatedly frustrated New Deal initiatives, did so again by siding with Mr. Humphrey’s executor. In the 1914 act creating the FTC, Congress validly sought “to create a body of experts...independent of executive authority except in its selection,” the court found.

As a practical matter, Humphrey’s Executor proved little hindrance to President Roosevelt, who had already replaced the dead commissioner. And in succeeding years, Democrats more than Republicans turned to the independent-agency structure to implement their agenda, establishing such entities as the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Election Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Because the D.C. Circuit frequently hears regulatory cases, Judge Kavanaugh lives in the shadow of the late Commissioner Humphrey’s executor.

“This is my life: the alphabet soup of federal agencies,” he joked in a 2015 lecture at Marquette University.

"Iran oil shipments are declining at a faster-than-expected pace ahead of U.S. sanctions set to begin in November.

Iran expects crude exports to fall by a third in September, according to people familiar with purchasing plans, potentially posing an unforeseen supply risk to markets. Officials at the state-run National Iranian Oil Co. provisionally expect crude shipments to drop to about 1.5 million barrels a day next month, down from about 2.3 million barrels a day in June, say people familiar with the country’s ports loading program.

Many experts had expected oil shipments to decline by about 1 million barrels by year's end. Now some of them say that fall may have already happened. Iran hasn’t yet announced its exports this month or its forecast for next month.

The developments reflect in part a reluctance of tanker companies to ship Iranian oil.

Oil companies have until Nov. 4 to adjust to a U.S. ban on buying Iranian oil following President Trump’s decision in May to pull out of the nuclear agreement with Tehran. The Europe Union, China and other countries have vowed to resist the unilateral U.S. sanctions and are trying to find ways to keep buying crude from Iran. But they have struggled to find banks, shipping companies and insurers that are willing to risk running afoul of the U.S.

The managing director of Iran’s state oil company, Ali Kardor, didn’t return a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Iran’s oil ministry said she had no information about upcoming Iran oil exports.

Countries such as India, Japan and European Union members complied with a previous round of U.S. sanctions on Iran in 2012. What has changed since that time is that the Trump administration, unlike the prior U.S. administration, isn’t pushing for import reductions but a complete halt, said Sara Vakhshouri, president of Washington-based oil consultancy SVB Energy International.

Ms. Vakhshouri, a former National Iranian Oil Co. market analyst, said she expects Iran’s crude exports to drop by half to 800,000 barrels a day in November compared to August. The country’s shipments remained above 1 million barrels a day at the beginning of the last round of sanctions.

While oil prices rose following Mr. Trump’s decision to bring back sanctions in May, some analysts say traders have yet to realize the scale of upcoming Iranian disruptions.

“I am not sure this drop is really got priced in,” said Helima Croft, the chief commodities strategist at Canadian broker RBC. “Many markets participants still seem to believe that the decline will be smaller because President Trump would not dare risk overt tightening the market” before the mid-terms U.S. elections.

So far, Iranian oil exports to Europe and India have halved in recent months and, in August, fell by 25% in China, said Reid I’Anson, economic analyst at Paris-based shipping-data tracker Kpler.

Turkey, which is embroiled in a separate dispute with the U.S., shows how even a U.S. adversary which disagrees with the Trump administration’s policy on Iran is impacted.

Just after Mr. Trump’s May announcement, Iran’s exports to the European country fell from 227,000 barrels a day that month to 70,000 barrels a day in June, with the loss offset by Iraqi and Russian crude, according to Ankara’s Energy Market Regulatory Body.

Turkey’s main Iran oil importer Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS exemplifies its vulnerability to sanctions the country rejects. The country’s largest refiner banks with a joint-venture part owned by UniCredit SpA, which is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for possible sanctions violations related to the Islamic Republic, according to disclosures from both companies.

UniCredit and Tupras didn’t return requests for comment.

Shipping is emerging as Iran’s main Achille’s Heel. Starting Nov. 4, the Trump administration’s sanctions will also ban insurance coverage for Iran oil tankers. Shippers from China, India, Greece or Spain that transported Iranian oil as recently as July have stopped dealing with Tehran, according to tracker FleetMon and some of the shippers. Many of the shippers are insured with European firms that think dealing with Iran is not worth the risk of falling afoul of the U.S., said Mike Salthouse, chairman of the Sanctions subcommittee at the International Group of Protection & Indemnity Clubs.

The P&I Clubs’ reinsurers cover around 90% of the world’s shipping tonnage, including oil tankers. Mr. Salthouse said “if we provide insurance in breach U.S. sanctions, that would deny us access to U.S. financial system, that would put us out of business overnight.”

"WASHINGTON—President Trump canceled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s scheduled weekend trip to North Korea in a series of tweets Friday after a briefing, signaling for the first time frustration with deadlocked nuclear talks.

“I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea, at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula…” Mr. Trump said on Twitter.

Mr. Trump’s decision appeared to take State Department officials by surprise. Mr. Pompeo named a new special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, to lead the talks only a day earlier, and staffers were preparing for the trip to go ahead on Sunday as planned.

Mr. Pompeo was in a meeting with Mr. Trump in the White House when the president wrote the tweets calling off the meeting, a person familiar with the matter said. The president made the decision after talking to Mr. Pompeo and getting an update on the state of negotiations, which have been gridlocked since Mr. Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June.

“I’m not satisfied with the progress,” Mr. Trump said at the meeting with his top diplomat, the person familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Trump appeared to blame China for the lack of progress on the negotiations, even though Beijing doesn’t have a direct role in the process. Officials say progress has stalled because the U.S. wants North Korea to take concrete steps before making any concessions, while Pyongyang wants Washington to reciprocate as it moves toward denuclearization.

Mr. Trump suggested in one tweet that China was no longer cooperating on denuclearization as a way to punish the U.S. over tariffs that have triggered a tit-for-tat trade dispute between the two countries. He said Mr. Pompeo would travel to North Korea after the trade dispute is resolved.

“Because of our much tougher Trading stance with China, I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were,” Mr. Trump wrote.

The U.S. has been calling on China to strictly enforce wide-ranging United Nations sanctions targeting North Korea’s economy. The sanctions were designed to exert painful economic pressure on Pyongyang and drive North Korea’s Mr. Kim to enter into talks over the country’s nuclear program.

Beijing initially appeared to work closely with the U.S. to enforce the U.N. sanctions, but in recent weeks U.S. officials have protested, citing a reported increase in trade between China and North Korea, and they warned that it could ease pressure on Pyongyang to negotiate.

Trade talks between the U.S. and China ended on Thursday without any sign of progress toward a solution. The U.S. put in place tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese goods on Thursday, raising the total to $50 billion. The Chinese have matched them dollar for dollar. The U.S. is eyeing tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese imports, about half the total from China, that could start taking effect as early as September.

China’s Foreign Ministry issued a stern riposte to Mr. Trump’s remarks, saying Beijing has consistently worked toward denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and maintaining regional stability.

“The U.S. statement is contrary to the basic facts and irresponsible. We are gravely concerned,” ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a Saturday statement. All relevant countries should “show more sincerity and flexibility, instead of acting capriciously and blaming others.”

Mr. Pompeo and his newly appointed special representative to North Korea, Mr. Biegun, were due to leave for Pyongyang on Sunday and then travel to Beijing.

It wasn’t immediately clear why Mr. Trump linked China’s lack of help on sanctions to the decision to cancel the talks with North Korea. Administration officials have often said that economic issues related to China and North Korea are kept on separate tracks, even though Mr. Trump sometimes treats them as related.

The purpose of the trip was to introduce Mr. Beigun, who will be taking over responsibility for the talks, and to push Pyongyang to do more to show commitment to its promise to move toward giving up its nuclear weapons.

Mr. Trump has long insisted the talks with North Korea were progressing well, and Friday’s tweets were the first indication that progress was going slower than expected.

As recently as last month, Mr. Trump tweeted that the U.S. was having “many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well!”

South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, in a telephone call with Mr. Pompeo on Saturday, expressed regret over Mr. Pompeo’s delayed visit to North Korea and said all sides should “maintain momentum” of the talks and work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establishing peace, according to a press release from Seoul’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Mr. Pompeo has made several trips to Pyongyang, but talks have been gridlocked over opposing demands. The U.S. wants North Korea to front-load its promises to denuclearize and take concrete steps to dismantle its assets before offering any concessions. North Korea wants the U.S. to make reciprocal, step-by-step concessions as a show of good faith.

Mr. Biegun was appointed to take over the nuclear talks on Thursday, after Mr. Pompeo’s relationship with the North Koreans appeared to sour. North Korea’s foreign ministry described Mr. Pompeo’s approach as “gangster-like” after a visit in July, and avoided a bilateral meeting with the secretary during a regional meeting earlier this month.

Despite the lack of progress at the lower level, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have continued to send each other friendly signals. On Friday, Mr. Trump repeated a previous promise to see Mr. Kim again. The two leaders met at a summit in Singapore in June.

“In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim. I look forward to seeing him soon!,” Mr. Trump said in another Tweet Friday.

The State Department didn’t immediately comment.

"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia—Malaysian Police on Friday charged the alleged mastermind of the multibillion-dollar 1Malaysia Development Bhd. scandal with money laundering, saying it would facilitate his arrest overseas.

They are the first criminal charges brought in Malaysia against financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, who has been moving between Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China in recent months, according to people with knowledge of his movements.

In conjunction with the charges, a Malaysian court issued arrest warrants for Mr. Low and his father, Low Hock Peng. The elder Mr. Low isn’t believed to be in Malaysia, say people familiar with his movements.

Amar Singh, chief of the Malaysian police commercial-crime division, said the procedures would ease Mr. Low’s return from another country but didn’t specify which one.

He said Mr. Low faces eight money-laundering charges and his father one, Mr. Singh said.

Mr. Low maintains his innocence and is conferring with consulting his lawyers, a spokesman for Mr. Low said in a statement. He won’t submit to any jurisdiction “where his guilt has been predetermined by politics,” the statement it added, saying he couldn’t get a fair trial in Malaysia.

The scandal at 1MDB, a state development fund established in 2009, led to the downfall of the Malaysian government that created the fund and is being investigated in several countries over allegations that billions of dollars were siphoned off.

The prime minister ousted in the May election, Najib Razak, has been charged with money laundering and criminal abuse of power. He has rejected those charges.

During his tenure, Malaysian probes found no wrongdoing at 1MDB.

Current Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday that “rumors’’ lead him to believe Mr. Low “is probably in China,” but that he hadn’t asked Chinese officials about it during a visit to Beijing this week.

A spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry said Friday that he had no information on the case and reiterated that Beijing is willing to cooperate with other governments on judicial matters.

The charges filed by Malaysian police allege Mr. Low received $260.8 million between December 2013 and June 2014 and transferred $188.2 million between January 2014 and June 2014, in some cases with the involvement of a Cayman Islands company, World View Ltd., that the U.S. Justice Department has previously said was used by Mr. Low to control his yacht Equanimity.

Malaysia seized the $250 million yacht earlier this month with the help of Indonesia, where the yacht had been traveling. Mr. Low’s representatives have called the seizure improper.

The receipt and transfers of money were conducted via separate accounts at BSI Bank in Singapore, according to copies of the charges seen by The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Low’s father was charged with transferring $56.5 million to his son in February 2014, according to the charge sheet.

Each count carries a maximum fine of 5 million ringgit ($1.2 million), a jail term up to five years, or both.

Singapore has separately charged Mr. Low with money laundering and receiving stolen property, the Singapore attorney general’s office said.

A court in Singapore there sentenced a former wealth manager at BSI to 4½ years in prison last year after he pleaded guilty to a money-laundering offense linked to misappropriated 1MDB funds.

BSI was renamed EFG after its purchase in 2016 by Zurich-based private banking group EFG International .

A spokeswoman for EFG said it had no comment.

The U.S. Justice Department alleges Mr. Low helped siphon off at least $4.5 billion from 1MDB between 2009 and 2015. Mr. Low and conspirators from Asia and the Middle East allegedly used the proceeds to buy luxury homes in the U.S., frequent Las Vegas nightclubs and fund Hollywood movies, among other things.

The Justice Department has sought, via civil lawsuits in California, to seize almost $2 billion in assets allegedly bought with the stolen money. The Equanimity was initially seized in Indonesia in February at the request of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Malaysia is eager to quickly sell the yacht and recoup the proceeds.

The yacht’s representatives say that the vessel is being poorly cared for in Malaysia and is losing value. They also contend that ownership disputes would lead to its being sold for far less than its market value.

"WASHINGTON—Top congressional Republicans sharply criticized President Donald Trump Monday after he cast doubt on Russian interference in the 2016 election during a press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“Missed opportunity by President Trump to firmly hold Russia accountable for 2016 meddling and deliver a strong warning regarding future elections,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), who often advocates for Mr. Trump on Capitol Hill, said on Twitter Monday. “This answer by President Trump will be seen by Russia as a sign of weakness and create far more problems than it solves.”

Standing next to Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump said he trusted the Russian president’s denial that Moscow had interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign and didn’t take an opportunity to warn Mr. Putin against future meddling.

“I have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,” Mr. Trump said. During the press conference, Mr. Putin said he had wanted Mr. Trump to win the election but that his country didn’t meddle in the campaign.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), who is retiring at year’s end, pushed back on Mr. Trump’s assessment Monday afternoon.

“There is no question that Russia interfered in our election and continues attempts to undermine democracy here and around the world,” Mr. Ryan said in a statement. “The president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally.”

“The Russians are not our friends and I entirely believe the assessment of our intelligence community,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.).

Mr. Trump’s comments came just days after special counsel Robert Muellercharged a dozen Russian intelligence officers with hacking the computers of Democratic organizations during the 2016 campaign and releasing emails strategically during the campaign to undercut Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid.

GOP Sen. John McCain, who is battling brain cancer at home in Arizona, delivered one of the most blistering attacks on Mr. Trump Monday.

“Today’s press conference in Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory,” Mr. McCain said in a statement. “No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant.”

Because Mr. Trump is highly popular with the most faithful Republican voters, GOP lawmakers have largely refrained from criticizing him, even while he has deviated from party orthodoxy by escalating a trade fight by levying tariffs and criticizing such traditional U.S. allies as the European Union and Britain.

Mr. Trump’s sway is powerful among GOP voters: Rep. Mark Sanford (R., S.C.), a critic of the president, lost his primary last month after Mr. Trump endorsed his GOP opponent.

But congressional Republicans objected Monday when Mr. Trump said he held “both countries” responsible for the deterioration in U.S.-Russia relations and said he did not see “any reason why” Russia would be responsible for interfering in the 2016 election.

“A person can be in favor of improving relations with Russia, in favor of meeting with Putin, and still think something is not right here,” Rep. Justin Amash (R., Mich.) said on Twitter after the press conference.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.), who has frequently clashed with Mr. Trump, called the president’s remarks “shameful” on Twitter.

“I never thought I would see the day when our American President would stand on the stage with the Russian President and place blame on the United States for Russian aggression,” said Mr. Flake, who is retiring.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) said he found Mr. Trump’s comments “deeply disappointing” and that they made the U.S. look like a “pushover.”

“This was a very good day for President Putin,” said Mr. Corker, noting he was startled that Mr. Trump didn’t defend U.S. intelligence agencies, which work for him. “It was saddening at this point to see our intelligence agencies on parity with the words that were coming out of President Putin’s mouth.”

Other Republicans defended the president’s statements in Helsinki, arguing that American intelligence agencies are unreliable.

“I think for the president to cast doubt is appropriate,” Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.) said, in a reference to the election interference investigation. “Having said that, Putin is an evil man who has killed many people in his own country, there’s no question at all Russia is still an adverse entity to the United States.”

The White House said Monday evening that Mr. Trump would meet with lawmakers Tuesday afternoon, but didn’t provide further details.

Democrats were sharply critical of Mr. Trump’s decision to defend Russia and criticize U.S. intelligence officers.

“For the president to side with Putin over his own intelligence officials and blame the United States for Russia’s attack on our democracy is a complete disgrace,” said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Mr. Trump’s “behavior is so inexplicable and so against the interest of the United States” that he wonders what Moscow has on the president.

Mr. Schumer said Republicans should do more than issue statements. In a press conference on Monday, he said GOP lawmakers should demand the indicted Russians be sent to the U.S. for trial, ratchet up sanctions against Russia and that members of the president’s security team should be called to testify before Congress.

"Mary McCartney, 48, is a fine-art photographer and author of several vegetarian cookbooks. Her latest book of photography is “The White Horse” (Rizzoli). She spoke with Marc Myers.

One of my earliest memories is my parents sitting me on a pony in Scotland. They carefully wrapped my hands around the horse’s mane and slowly walked me around. I must have been about a year old.

The pony’s name was Coconut. He was very kind and patient. I remember the coarse texture of his mane and how I held onto it tightly. Riding him that young gave me an early sense of pride and self-confidence.

As a family, we spent most summers together at a remote farmhouse on Scotland’s Kintyre peninsula. During the school year, we lived in central London.

Those summer stays were about seclusion and family. By spending long periods far away and close together, my parents, siblings and I were each other’s entertainment.

Growing up, I loved the Scottish landscape. The land wasn’t manicured or developed. It was open and wide, and the sky was expansive. Hills were covered in heather and bracken, and the fields were divided by old stone walls that had fallen apart in places. You could see for miles.

Our one-story, green-and-red stone farmhouse was a comfortable and simple home. We spent much of our time outdoors, with our horses, sheep and dogs.

Growing up with artistic parents was inspiring. My mother, Linda, was a professional photographer, and my father was Paul McCartney. In London, they took me to art exhibits. I was encouraged to observe, feel and express myself. My mother always had beautiful photography books around and we had contemporary artwork.

In Scotland and London, my mother and her cameras were inseparable. They were a part of her and always at the ready to take photos of images that moved her.

Mum was kind and gentle, comforting and elegant. She had a great sense of humor. She often left me alone with a camera to figure out my own artistic taste and sensibility.

There were two parts of me growing up. Either I was out and about in London and everyone was watching. Or, in stark contrast, I was in Scotland, surrounded by nature. Those extremes made me who I am.

At school in London, I was quite chatty and sociable. I was curious about people and wanted to know their personal stories. On holiday, in seclusion in Scotland, I could become more introspective. I’d ride off into the hills for adventures on my new pony, Sugar Foot.

Riding was the perfect way to explore the landscape. I had an opportunity to become more observant, taking in nature from my pony’s perspective. I felt safe.

Photography first became a passion in my teens. My mother was forthcoming with invaluable advice. We both processed our artistic viewpoint through our own personal experiences.

I also learned a great deal just by watching her. I feel like I inherited her eye. Mum was interested in nonperfect, authentic moments. We both strived to gain a subject’s trust and not rush a promising situation.

She also helped me develop a critical eye. During our summers in Scotland, I’d save up my rolls of film and have them developed at the lab when I got back to London. Then we’d go through the photographs and edit out our favorites together. I liked hearing her opinions.

After college, I had a job as a photo researcher at a music-book publisher. Then Mum invited me into her archive to look through all of her books of contact sheets.

This was the moment I became passionate about taking up photography professionally. I was 23 years old. And when I told my mother the news, she gave me one of her prized cameras—a Leica R7.

That Leica was the kind of camera that motivates you to take photographs. When I held it, I felt comfortable and inspired to go out on adventures and search for moments to capture in a single frame.

The camera’s sleek design made it easy to handle, and I loved the sound and feel of the shutter release. There was something about the click that was substantial and reassuring.

Today, my husband, Simon Aboud, and I live with our four children in central London, near Regent Park. It’s a Victorian apartment with lots of light. My favorite room is our bedroom. On a good day outside the bedroom windows I can watch the clouds float by and the trees sway in the breeze.

A couple of times a month, I drive down to stables in the countryside south of London to ride my white horse, Alejandro. He’s strong and kind and stunningly beautiful. We trust and calm each other as we explore the natural landscape.

Sadly, my mother passed away in 1998. I still have the Leica R7 she gave me. When I use it now, I feel as if she’s there with me, giving me advice and confidence. Just holding the camera takes me back to the day she gave it to me.

The Story Behind the Fab Photo

Mary McCartney on the back cover of Paul McCartney's 1970 solo album.

Perhaps my mother’s most famous photograph of me was taken in Scotland in 1969. When I was a little baby, my father, Paul, would put me inside his soft zip-up jacket when they went for a horse ride.

One day, after they returned to the farmhouse and my father dismounted, my mother took the image of my dad and me. It wasn’t preplanned or posed. My mother just caught the moment in the golden light of late afternoon.

My parents used the image on the back of my father’s “McCartney” album when it came out in early 1970. I looked pretty cozy in there.

"Michael Cohen had many reasons to play ball last weekend when his legal team sat down to talk to federal prosecutors.

The Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office had testimony from Mr. Cohen’s accountant and business partners, along with bank records, tax filings and loan applications that implicated not only Mr. Cohen in potential criminal activity, but also his wife, who filed taxes jointly with her husband. Prosecutors signaled Mr. Cohen would face nearly 20 criminal counts, potentially carrying a lengthy prison sentence and staggering financial penalties.

Adding to the pressure, David Pecker, the chairman of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, provided prosecutors with details about payments Mr. Cohen arranged with women who alleged sexual encounters with President Trump, including Mr. Trump’s knowledge of the deals.

This account of how Mr. Cohen went from a pugnacious defender of the president to turning on Mr. Trump is based on details provided by people close to Mr. Cohen and others briefed on the discussions with prosecutors.

For weeks, the president had been distancing himself from Mr. Cohen, including by stopping paying his longtime attorney’s legal fees, making clear amid the pressure that he was on his own.

Under oath on Tuesday, before a packed courtroom, Mr. Cohen created a spectacular moment without parallel in American history when he confessed to two crimes that he said he committed at the behest of the man who would become president.

Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes, including tax evasion and making false statements to a bank, capping a monthslong investigation into his business dealings and work as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer. For the president, it opens up a perilous new legal front.

Mr. Cohen in court said Mr. Trump directed him to arrange payments during the 2016 campaign to two women who alleged they had sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. The payments violated caps on campaign contributions and a ban on corporate contributions, prosecutors said.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump denied he directed Mr. Cohen to buy the women’s silence. Contradicting earlier statements, the president said he became aware of the payments to the women “later on” and said Mr. Cohen was reimbursed from his personal funds, not his 2016 campaign coffers.

The investigation is continuing, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Although the plea deal doesn’t require Mr. Cohen’s cooperation, it leaves the door open for him to talk with both the Southern District of New York and special counsel Robert Mueller. The court restricted Mr. Cohen’s travel to New York City; Chicago, where he owns taxi medallions; South Florida, where his parents live; and Washington, D.C., where the special counsel is based.

The deal doesn’t preclude further prosecutions, including other charges against Mr. Cohen.

Prosecutors built their case partly by using materials seized in April 9 raids of Mr. Cohen’s home, office and hotel, including recordings and other items that provided evidence of campaign-finance violations.

Investigators quickly zeroed in on Mr. Cohen’s relationship with American Media, including its role brokering deals on behalf of Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker had been an open supporter of Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Prosecutors say Mr. Pecker offered to help keep quiet negative stories about Mr. Trump that might come to the National Enquirer, a practice in the business known as “catch and kill.”

American Media executives were involved in both hush-money deals that formed the basis of Mr. Cohen’s guilty plea to campaign-finance violations, prosecutors said on Tuesday. One was a $130,000 payment to Stephanie Clifford—a former porn star who goes professionally by Stormy Daniels—as part of an agreement to keep her from publicly discussing an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. The payment was first reported by The Wall Street Journal in January.

The second was a $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her exclusive story of an alleged extramarital affair with Mr. Trump, a story that was purchased by American Media in August 2016 at Mr. Cohen’s urging, and then never published. The payment was first reported by the Journal in November 2016.

On April 5, days before the raids, Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One he didn’t know about the payment to Ms. Clifford, and referred questions about the matter to Mr. Cohen. “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen,” Mr. Trump said. “Michael is my attorney.”

Mr. Cohen, who that night was staying aboard the yacht of Trump donor Franklin Haney, which was docked in Miami, grew irate on the ship soon after Mr. Trump made his remarks distancing himself from the Clifford payment, according to a person familiar with the episode. Mr. Cohen was swearing loudly as others on the boat were sipping their drinks, the person said.

The search warrant executed on April 9 sought materials and information related to a wide range of communications, including ones related to the payments to Ms. Clifford and Ms. McDougal. At the same time, investigators subpoenaed Mr. Pecker, American Media and the Trump Organization, Mr. Trump’s business.

Prosecutors had reason to be concerned that without raiding Mr. Cohen’s office, “records could have been deleted without record and without recourse for law enforcement,” according to a court filing.

Prosecutors in the Southern District said the investigation into Mr. Cohen was, in part, a referral from the special counsel’s office. It isn’t clear when the referral took place, or if the office was already investigating Mr. Cohen when the referral came through.

The special counsel’s office was examining Mr. Cohen’s finances since at least October 2017, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Prior to the raids, investigators had already obtained covert search warrants on multiple email accounts used by Mr. Cohen, prosecutors said in a court filing. Early this year, they also had subpoenaed Mr. Cohen’s former accountant, Jeffrey A. Getzel, who handled Mr. Cohen’s personal and business tax returns.

In May, Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for Ms. Clifford, released a memo detailing payments made to Mr. Cohen from companies including AT&T Inc. and Novartis AG , as well as an investment firm linked to a Russian oligarch. Federal agents investigated whether Mr. Cohen lobbied Trump administration officials on the companies’ behalf without registering as a lobbyist, the Journal previously reported.

Initially, Mr. Cohen seemed unlikely to turn on the president. Although their relationship was at times turbulent, Mr. Trump appreciated Mr. Cohen’s absolute loyalty. On the day of the raids, Mr. Trump called the move a “disgrace” and a “witch hunt.”

Soon after the April raids, Mr. Cohen’s relationship with Mr. Trump began to deteriorate.

The estrangement began over legal bills, said a person who has spoken with Mr. Cohen about the matter. The Trump family covered part of Mr. Cohen’s legal fees after the raids, but then stopped paying.

Mr. Cohen felt exposed. Public comments by Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, put distance between the president and Mr. Cohen and further alienated the attorney, the person said.

Mr. Cohen told associates and friends he felt Mr. Trump didn’t have his back and vented that the president hadn’t personally offered to pay his legal bills in the Manhattan investigation, which he said were “bankrupting” him.

Mr. Cohen’s troubles increased in May, when Evgeny “Gene” Freidman, a New York City taxi mogul who managed taxi medallions owned by Mr. Cohen and his relatives, pleaded guilty to state criminal tax fraud and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in their probe of Mr. Cohen.

By then, prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service had focused on Mr. Cohen’s personal income taxes. In conversations with a potential witness in June and July, investigators asked “very pointed” questions about various tax filings, according to a person familiar with the conversations.

“They knew what they wanted, they knew what they had, and they went after it,” the person said.

In late June, Mr. Cohen openly broke with Mr. Trump.

A personal turning point for Mr. Cohen was a conversation with his father, Maurice Cohen, a Holocaust survivor.

Mr. Cohen’s father urged him not to protect the president, saying he didn’t survive the Holocaust to have his name sullied by Mr. Trump, according to a person who was told about the conversation. The elder Mr. Cohen couldn’t be reached for comment.

On June 20, Mr. Cohen stepped down from his position as the Republican National Committee’s deputy finance chairman and tweeted his first public criticism of his former boss: “As the son of a Polish holocaust survivor, the images and sounds of this family separation policy [are] heart wrenching.” The tweet no longer appears on Mr. Cohen’s Twitter account.

By then, Mr. Cohen had hired New York lawyer Guy Petrillo to represent him in the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s probe. The choice of Mr. Petrillo, who had once served as the chief of the office’s criminal division, was seen as a sign that Mr. Cohen hoped to cooperate. Mr. Petrillo began to signal this intent to prosecutors.

Shortly after Mr. Petrillo’s hiring, Mr. Cohen told ABC News in an interview that his first loyalty was to his family and country, not to the president.

In July, a recording became public that Mr. Cohen surreptitiously made of a conversation he had with Mr. Trump in September 2016 about buying the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story. The president has denied the affair.

The president’s legal team had waived attorney-client privilege on the recording, which had been seized in the April 9 raids.

The week of the recording’s release, the investigation appeared to accelerate, people familiar with the investigation said.

Federal prosecutors faced an early September deadline to charge Mr. Cohen. After that, they would have to wait until after the midterm elections, under Department of Justice guidelines, or risk criticism of potentially affecting the election’s outcome. They had follow-up witness interviews scheduled as recently as this week, a person familiar with the investigation said, but canceled them as the plea agreement came together over the weekend.

Given the Justice Department’s policy of not indicting sitting presidents, a guilty plea from Mr. Cohen and his public implication of Mr. Trump were among the strongest outcomes prosecutors could have hoped for, according to former federal prosecutors. For prosecutors, the guilty plea meant they could avoid a contentious trial and free up resources to pursue other investigations.

On Monday, Manhattan federal prosecutors filed a court document, in a case then labeled as U.S. v. John Doe, indicating a guilty plea was forthcoming.

By Tuesday night, hours after Mr. Cohen implicated Mr. Trump in a possible crime, one of Mr. Cohen’s lawyers, Lanny Davis, appeared on cable news shows to say Mr. Cohen wouldn’t accept a pardon from Mr. Trump and “is more than happy to tell the special counsel all that he knows.”

"I met Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap—who died on Friday—twice. The first time was in the Vietnamese military hospital where I was taken shortly after my capture in 1967. My father commanded all U.S. forces in the Pacific, which made me an object of curiosity in some quarters of the North Vietnamese government.

I remember several high-ranking visitors in addition to the guards and interrogators I saw daily. Giap, North Vietnam's minister of defense, was the only one I recognized. He stayed only a few moments, staring at me, then left without saying a word.

Our second meeting was in the early 1990s, during one of many trips I made to Hanoi to discuss the POW/MIA issue and the normalization of relations between our countries. I had asked then-Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach and his deputy, Le Mai, to arrange a brief interview with the legendary commander of the People's Army of North Vietnam.

The next day I was ushered into the grand reception room of the Beaux-Arts presidential palace the French had built for their colonial governors, where the general was waiting. Smiling, diminutive, aged but spry, and dressed in a gray suit and tie, he hardly looked like his wartime reputation as a ruthless fighter with a fierce temper.

Giap greeted me warmly beneath an enormous bust of Ho Chi Minh, who had led Vietnam in the wars against the French and the United States. Both of us clasped each other's shoulders as if we were reunited comrades rather than former enemies.

I had hoped our discussion would concentrate on his historical role. After I came home from Vietnam in 1973, I read everything I could get my hands on about both the French and American wars there, starting with Bernard Fall's ""Hell in a Very Small Place,"" his classic study of the 1954 siege of Dien Bien Phu, where French colonial rule effectively ended and Giap's genius first became apparent to an astonished world.

I wanted to hear Giap describe that nearly two-month long battle, to explain how his forces had shocked the French by managing the impossible feat of bringing artillery across mountains and through the densest jungles. I wanted to talk to him about that other marvel of logistics, the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

I knew he was proud of his reputation as the ""Red Napoleon,"" and I presumed he would welcome an opportunity to indulge my curiosity about his triumphs. I wanted us to behave as two retired military officers and former enemies recounting the historical events in which he had played a critical part and I a small one. But he answered most of my questions briefly, adding little to what I already knew, and then waved his hand to indicate disinterest.

That is all in the past now, he said. You and I should discuss a future where our countries are not enemies but friends. And so we did, two politicians discussing the business between our countries that had brought me to Vietnam.

Giap was a master of logistics, but his reputation rests on more than that. His victories were achieved by a patient strategy that he and Ho Chi Minh were convinced would succeed—an unwavering resolve to suffer immense casualties and the near total destruction of their country to defeat any adversary, no matter how powerful. ""You will kill 10 of us, we will kill one of you,"" Ho told the French, ""but in the end, you will tire of it first.""

Giap executed that strategy with an unbending will. The French repulsed wave after wave of frontal attacks at Dien Bien Phu. The 1968 Tet offensive against the U.S. was a military disaster that effectively destroyed the Viet Cong. But Giap persisted and prevailed.

The U.S. never lost a battle against North Vietnam, but it lost the war. Countries, not just their armies, win wars. Giap understood that. We didn't. Americans tired of the dying and the killing before the Vietnamese did. It's hard to defend the morality of the strategy. But you can't deny its success.

Near the end of our meeting, I made another attempt to test Giap's candor. I asked him if it were true that he had opposed Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia. He dismissed that too, with something like, ""the party's decisions are always correct.""

With that, our meeting came to an end. We stood up, shook hands, and as I turned to leave, he grasped my arm, and said softly, ""you were an honorable enemy.""

I don't know if he meant that as a comparison to Vietnam's other adversaries, the Chinese, the Japanese or the French, who had killed his wife, or if it was an implicit recognition we had fought for ideals rather than empire and that our humanity had played a part in our defeat. Maybe he just meant to flatter me. Whatever his meaning, I appreciated the sentiment.

"SEOUL—When North Korea returned the purported remains of a British fighter pilot in 2011 as part of a diplomatic rapprochement, experts in London found something amiss: They concluded after laboratory analysis that Pyongyang had sent the remains of a dead animal.

British officials immediately protested.

An embarrassed North Korean diplomatic corps confronted their military counterparts, who had been responsible for overseeing the efforts to recover the remains of Flight Lt. Desmond Hinton, who was shot down on the outskirts of Pyongyang during the 1950-53 Korean War.

“Too bad,” came the reply from North Korea’s military to Thae Yong Ho, who says he was involved in the discussions at the time and who later became North Korea’s second-ranking diplomat in the U.K.

The episode, recounted in a memoir published last month by Mr. Thae, who now lives in South Korea after defecting in 2016, offers a cautionary tale as the U.S. prepares to receive the remains of more than 250 American service members from North Korea as part of an agreement signed by President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last week.

Mr. Thae wrote in his memoir that the British government agreed not to publicize the fiasco. A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Seoul said she couldn’t comment. The North Korean government hasn’t commented on the affair.

The incident also highlights how little oversight the U.S. has into the repatriation process, which Mr. Trump has portrayed as one of the most concrete deliverables from his summit meeting with Mr. Kim in Singapore.

That the North Korean government could turn over as many as 250 sets of remains so quickly after the agreement last week suggests that Pyongyang might have set aside these remains for use as a bargaining chip in a moment such as this.

Hundreds of American remains were already in a Pyongyang warehouse by the late 1980s, said Mark Sauter, a private investigator based in Washington who has spent years researching the fates of Americans missing in the Korean War.

It can take years for the Pentagon to identify DNA from recovered remains. Some of the initially recovered American remains immediately after the Korean War still haven’t been identified.

“The remains are often mixed amongst each other, not only among American dead” but sometimes among different nationalities, complicating the identification process, Mr Sauter said.

The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the Department of Defense’s main office for identifying recovered remains, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

In one case, officials in Washington and Seoul took 17 years to identify the remains of one soldier recovered from a North Korean battlefield. The remains, which North Korea turned over to the U.S. in 2001, were initially suspected to be those of a U.S. soldier. But scientists more recently concluded that they were from a South Korean soldier.

Recovery work for American war remains on the Korean Peninsula began in 1951, while the conflict was still raging, according to the agency’s website. In 1954, a year after the armistice was signed, North Korea returned the remains of more than 3,000 U.S. prisoners of war.

More recently, the U.S. conducted recovery work inside North Korea between 1996 and 2005, during which more than 220 sets of remains were returned to the U.S.—a fraction of the 7,700 Americans still listed as missing, of whom about 5,300 were lost in North Korea.

Complicating matters is the possibility that Pyongyang could demand payment for recovery services, as it did in the past, including the most-recent return of U.S. remains, according to Moon Seong-mook, a retired South Korean Army brigadier-general who negotiated with North Korea on the recovery of Korean War dead and other military matters between 2002 and 2007.

After the collapse of denuclearization talks last decade, Pyongyang ended its efforts at recovering U.S. war remains.

Some U.S. experts question the integrity of North Korea’s recovery efforts. The Pyongyang regime has been accused of planting bodies of U.S. war dead that it has held for years in storage at recovery sites.

A 2005 report by the Congressional Research Service also raises questions about whether North Korea may have secretly detained U.S. prisoners after the Korean War ended, rather than returning them to the U.S. Small numbers of U.S. POWs in North Korea may have been transferred to the Soviet Union, the report notes, citing “compelling circumstantial evidence.” Russia denied it held any U.S. POWs.

Mr. Moon, the retired brigadier-general, says the North might use the return of the remains to deflect attention from its human-rights abuses. “Pyongyang has propagandized these efforts to boast about their self-claimed humanitarianism,” he said.

"Congress is poised to strengthen the procedures for vetting both foreign investments in the U.S. and overseas transactions involving cutting-edge American technology.

Negotiators from the Senate and the House reached a deal on the final text of the provision to bolster both the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. and the U.S. export-control system, in an effort to block Chinese and other foreign transactions that could harm national security.

The measure represents the first major change in a decade to the rules governing foreign investment reviews, and its impending passage follows a bruising battle among lawmakers and some of the country’s biggest companies.

“It’s a done deal,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R., Texas), one of the architects of the initiative, in a Thursday interview.

The provision, which has been attached to a must-pass military spending bill, could become law as soon as this month. First introduced as proposed legislation by Mr. Cornyn and Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.) in November 2017, the measure will affect both foreign firms seeking deals in the U.S. and American companies doing business abroad.

The measure will strengthen CFIUS’s authority to review foreign entities’ minority-position investments through venture-capital funds and other means, its ability to vet real-estate transactions near sensitive U.S. facilities, and its right to review any deal structured to evade the committee’s jurisdiction, such as transactions that use shell companies to obfuscate ownership. It will also bolster the export-controls process to review overseas transactions such as joint-venture agreements involving sensitive U.S. technology.

A secretive panel called CFIUS is paving the way for President Trump to block more foreign business deals due to national security concerns. WSJ's Shelby Holliday explains why you'll hear more about CFIUS during the Trump era. Illustration: Laura Kammerman

CFIUS is an interagency committee that reviews proposed foreign takeovers of U.S. businesses. The committee, led by the Treasury, can advise the president to block such deals on national-security grounds. Export controls regulate which U.S. technologies can be sent abroad.

President Donald Trump in June said he would rely on Congress’s CFIUS provision to address national-security concerns with Chinese investment instead of imposing his own set of restrictions.

“America’s technology will now have stronger protections commensurate with the challenges from China and other nations seeking to exploit our current laws,” said Mr. Pittenger on Thursday.

The impending legislative victory for China hawks in Congress hardly seemed a foregone conclusion until very recently. It followed a nearly two-year-long battle to gather support from an array of government agencies, businesses and lawmakers that often held strong—and opposing—views.

Mr. Cornyn began talking with Treasury officials about cracking down on certain foreign deals in October 2016, according to a person familiar with the matter. At that time, Chinese investment was pouring into the country, tripling to a record $46 billion by the end of the year, according to analysts at New York research firm Rhodium Group.

Mr. Cornyn has said he was particularly concerned that China was exploiting loopholes in the CFIUS process to acquire U.S. technology with military applications. A February 2017 report by DIUx, a Defense Department unit, laid out just how Chinese investors were doing so and provided a road map for some of the bill’s text.

China presents unique national security issues for the U.S. because it is both a key military and economic rival, and many deals involving Chinese companies may be directed and subsidized by the government.

Although Mr. Cornyn began gaining traction through personal outreach to cabinet officials at the Treasury, Defense and Justice Departments—which are all heavy hitters on CFIUS—one early concern was the level of support across the aisle. While many Democrats were eager to crack down on China, some proposed expanding CFIUS’s remit beyond matters of national security to include issues such as economic competitiveness, which would have been a deal breaker for many Republicans. Ultimately the legislation attracted wide bipartisan support, including from co-sponsors Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.).

On the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Cornyn and his allies faced stiff opposition from major businesses such as International Business Machines Corp. and General Electric Co. , which publicly criticized an earlier iteration of the bill as overly broad. The companies took particular issue with an initial plan to widen CFIUS’s remit beyond inbound investment to include deals struck abroad as well.

Expanding CFIUS’s jurisdiction to include U.S. firms’ investments in joint ventures around the world “would generate thousands of additional cases for an already under-resourced CFIUS system, reduce the likelihood of a coordinated approach with our closest allies and needlessly damage American companies and their workers seeking to compete abroad,” a GE lobbyist wrote in a March letter published in The Wall Street Journal in response to an op-ed by Mr. Pittenger published in the Journal two days earlier.

Mr. Cornyn hit back in an April speech on the Senate floor. “These joint ventures are essentially acquisitions by another name, which is why CFIUS should be able to review them for national-security risks,” he said, adding that those criticizing his proposal were only doing so “so they can bolster their bottom line.”

To overcome the impasse, lawmakers in both chambers agreed in May to amend the measure’s text to leave reviews of U.S. companies’ transactions abroad to a strengthened export-controls process, as opposed to giving CFIUS jurisdiction to review them.

While the deal paved the way for the measure’s inclusion in the must-pass defense bill, which greatly increased its chances of becoming law, it left some China hawks concerned that the resulting legislation won’t do enough to protect U.S. technology.

Soon, the initiative’s proponents had another problem. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) mounted an extraordinary, last-ditch effort to derail the CFIUS measure due to concerns it would overly restrict foreign investment.

Mr. Ryan excluded from recent CFIUS negotiations lawmakers with national-security expertise, such as members of the House Armed Services and Intelligence panels, as well as Mr. Pittenger, according to people familiar with the matter. A House GOP aide said Mr. Ryan followed past precedent and deferred to relevant committee chairmen on whom to name to negotiating panels. Mr. Ryan also told conferees it was important to get the CFIUS provision right, and “we will take all the time we need to do that,” according to the House GOP aide.

Mr. Hensarling, whose committee has jurisdiction over CFIUS, said in an interview earlier this week that he met with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin several times to discuss the measure, and with Mr. Ryan’s backing, threatened to remove the CFIUS provision from the defense bill if negotiators didn’t change the language. The move could have indefinitely postponed the passage of the CFIUS changes.

Mr. Hensarling has long been hostile to the CFIUS measure, according to people familiar with the matter. For example, he invited an array of witnesses who opposed the bill to testify at a handful of committee hearings on it and rejected a proposal by Mr. Pittenger to have a senior Treasury proponent speak about the bill at a committee retreat for Republican members earlier this year, one of the people said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hensarling said he worked for months, “holding numerous hearings and security briefings, in order to reach agreement on a House bill that passed the committee with unanimous support and balanced national security concerns with protecting personal freedom and economic opportunity.”

Still, the final effort by House GOP leadership to make material changes to the CFIUS measure was largely unsuccessful following pushback from cabinet officials and Vice President Mike Pence, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Pence’s office said that the vice president met with Mr. Trump and key legislators on the matter, and wanted to make sure the CFIUS provision wasn’t watered down to the point that it weakened national security.

Mr. Hensarling said in a Wednesday interview that the negotiations had resulted in “a lot of give and take.” Rep. Mac Thornberry (R., Texas), the top House negotiator on the defense bill that contains the CFIUS measure, said he expects the bill to get a vote next week.

"NEW YORK—Michael Cohen, the president’s former personal lawyer, told a federal judge that Donald Trump had directed him during the 2016 campaign to buy the silence of two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Cohen made the statement as he pleaded guilty Tuesday to eight criminal charges, including campaign-finance violations. He said he paid $130,000 to adult-film actress Stephanie Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, and coordinated a $150,000 payment by the publisher of the National Enquirer to former Playboy model Karen McDougal.

Mr. Cohen, who has described himself as Mr. Trump’s “fixer,” said he made both payments “for the purpose of influencing the election” and acted at the direction of “the candidate,” referring to Mr. Trump. That was the first time Mr. Cohen has admitted to coordinating with the president on the hush-money deals with women, both of which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The surprising admission by Mr. Cohen directly implicated Mr. Trump in a federal crime, escalating pressure on the president. Three other Trump associates have been charged with felonies and a fourth was convicted by a jury on Tuesday.

Mr. Trump and his representatives previously denied that he knew about the payments at the time they were made.

Mr. Cohen “worked to pay money to silence two women who he believed would be detrimental to” Mr. Trump and his campaign, said Robert Khuzami, the deputy U.S. attorney in Manhattan, at a news conference. “For that, he is going to pay a very, very serious price.”

Mr. Cohen, 51 years old, pleaded guilty to a total of eight criminal counts: two counts of illegal campaign contributions related to payments to women; five counts of evading personal income taxes from 2012 to 2016; and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. The charges stem from a grand jury investigation led by the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The plea agreement doesn’t require Mr. Cohen to cooperate with prosecutors. That doesn’t preclude him from providing information later on to the government, including to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s associates colluded with Russia in the 2016 campaign.

Under the plea deal, Mr. Cohen and the government agreed to a sentence of between about four years and five years in prison, with a fine of $20,000 to $1 million. Mr. Cohen was released on $500,000 bond.

Charging documents filed Tuesday revealed new details about the payments to the women, including disputes with the National Enquirer’s publisher over how to pay Ms. McDougal and a sham invoice Mr. Cohen filed with the Trump Organization to receive reimbursement for paying Ms. Clifford.

Under federal law, individual campaign contributions are limited to a total of $5,400 for each election cycle, including primary and general election votes, and corporate contributions are barred.

Conspiring to cause an excessive campaign contribution of more than $25,000 is an indictable offense and a felony. Sitting presidents cannot be indicted under Department of Justice policy.

Rick Hasen, a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine, said Mr. Cohen’s admission could amount to an “impeachable offense,” particularly if Democrats retake the majority in the House this fall.

Mr. Cohen, in a black suit and gold tie, left the courthouse Tuesday without speaking to reporters.

Lanny Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, said in a statement that Mr. Cohen “stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election.”

“If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn’t they be a crime for Donald Trump?” he said.

In an MSNBC interview later Tuesday, Mr. Davis suggested his client was willing to keep talking. He said Mr. Cohen would be “more than happy” to tell the special counsel “all that he knows about the obvious possibility of a conspiracy to collude and corrupt the American democracy system in the 2016 election.”

Mr. Davis said Mr. Cohen had knowledge of whether Mr. Trump had advance knowledge that Russia had hacked emails from Democratic servers that were later published by WikiLeaks, which Mr. Trump has said he didn’t.

The guilty plea cemented the break between the Republican president and his former longtime lawyer, who for years has touted his close relationship with Mr. Trump and once said he would “take a bullet” for the president. Mr. Cohen had said more recently he would seek to protect the interests of his own family and the country before those of the president.

Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said there was “no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president” in the charges against Mr. Cohen. Mr. Giuliani also attacked Mr. Cohen, adding: “It is clear that, as the prosecutor noted, Mr. Cohen’s actions reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time.”

During the court hearing, neither Mr. Cohen nor prosecutors named Mr. Trump or the two women to whom payments were made. Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Griswold said evidence at trial would have shown that the payments “were made in order to ensure” that the women “did not publicize their stories of alleged affairs with the candidate.”

In a statement read before U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III, Mr. Cohen admitted to making an illegal campaign contribution a month before the 2016 election when he paid $130,000 to Ms. Clifford to prohibit her from publicly discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. He said he worked “with and at the direction of the candidate” and was later repaid by Mr. Trump.

Mr. Cohen also admitted to arranging an illegal $150,000 payment from American Media Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer, to Ms. McDougal, a former Playboy playmate, for her exclusive story of an alleged extramarital affair she had with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Cohen said he coordinated the August 2016 payment with “the CEO of a media company,” referring to David Pecker, the chief executive of American Media who is a longtime friend of Messrs. Trump and Cohen. Mr. Cohen said the payment was made “at the request of the candidate” to keep Ms. McDougal from talking.

Mr. Pecker agreed to purchase Ms. McDougal’s story at Mr. Cohen’s “urging” and only after Mr. Cohen promised he would reimburse the company, prosecutors said. The publisher has previously said it purchased Ms. McDougal’s story for editorial reasons, not to benefit Mr. Trump’s campaign.

As early as August 2015, Mr. Pecker had offered to help the Trump campaign bury negative stories about Mr. Trump’s relationships with women, prosecutors said.

After American Media bought Ms. McDougal’s story, Mr. Cohen planned to buy the rights to the story for $125,000, according to Tuesday’s charging documents. An agreement was drawn up, but in October 2016, Mr. Pecker told Mr. Cohen “in substance, that the deal was off and that [he] should tear up the assignment agreement.” Federal agents retrieved the document from Mr. Cohen’s office during an April search, the document says.

The investigation into Mr. Cohen was unusual because parts of it played out publicly months before he was charged.

In an extraordinary move against a sitting president’s lawyer, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents on April 9 raided Mr. Cohen’s home, office and hotel room to seize millions of files, including cellphones, hard drives, iPads and even the contents of a shredder. Prosecutors had obtained the search warrant after a federal magistrate judge found probable cause to believe Mr. Cohen’s materials contained evidence of a crime.

Four days after the raid, lawyers for Mr. Cohen appeared in a public court hearing to stop federal prosecutors from reviewing the seized materials, claiming attorney-client privilege. Their motion set off a series of court hearings that each became their own media spectacle, including one attended by Ms. Clifford.

Mr. Khuzami, the deputy U.S. attorney, said after the plea hearing that Mr. Cohen also failed to report more than $4 million in income, including from interest from a personal loan, his taxi business and consulting commissions. Mr. Cohen deprived the federal government of $1.4 million in taxes, he said.

Those charges related to Mr. Cohen’s personal finances were used by federal investigators in recent weeks to apply pressure on Mr. Cohen, people familiar with the matter said. The Journal reported earlier this month that prosecutors were weighing tax- and bank-fraud charges against the lawyer, stemming from his taxi business and loan applications.

An open question is whether the president will move to pardon his former lawyer.

Mr. Trump has privately asked aides about his ability to issue pardons in the investigations of his associates, according to people familiar with the discussions, and he has declined to answer questions about whether he would pardon his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Mike Flynn.

Even if Mr. Trump pardons him, Mr. Cohen—like Mr. Manafort—could still face tax-related charges in New York state, although New York’s double-jeopardy laws could complicate any efforts at prosecution, people familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Trump was aboard Air Force One on his way to West Virginia, where he was set to hold a rally Tuesday evening, as Mr. Cohen entered his guilty plea and prosecutors announced the charges. At the same time, a jury in Alexandria, Va., returned a guilty verdict on eight charges against Mr. Manafort.

Disembarking Air Force One on Tuesday, the president defended Mr. Manafort, but declined to answer questions about his former lawyer.

Paul Manafort’s conviction Tuesday on eight counts—the jury deadlocked on 10 others—hardly spells the end of his legal troubles.

The former Trump campaign chairman faces a second trial next month on charges of obstruction of justice, failing to register as a foreign agent and conspiracy to launder money as part of an indictment brought by special counsel Robert Mueller’s grand jury in Washington.

"WASHINGTON— Sen. John McCain’s death touches off a number of questions about who will succeed him, putting the spotlight on Arizona’s Republican governor, Doug Ducey, who will choose a replacement.

Before Mr. McCain’s death, a spokesman for Mr. Ducey declined to share any details of the governor’s thinking. He pointed to a statement in which Mr. Ducey called Mr. McCain “a hero, always putting country before self.” The governor, who is up for re-election this year and expected to face a stiff general election challenge, is under intense pressure from rival wings of the Republican Party, including factions that want him to appoint someone loyal to President Trump.

The question of succession practically has been a forbidden subject in Washington, as Republicans had sought to show respect for one of the party’s few elder statesmen while he battled an aggressive form of brain cancer.

Mr. McCain was re-elected to his sixth term in 2016. His successor would serve for roughly the next two years, with voters choosing a new senator in the 2020 elections.

Newsletter Sign-up

Among the names that have been mentioned recently are Barbara Barrett, a former U.S. ambassador to Finland and the wife of retired Intel Corp. Chief Executive Craig Barrett, as well as Kirk Adams, chief of staff to Mr. Ducey. A name that has been floated as a long shot is former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, who was close to Mr. McCain.

Three other names have circulated: Michael Bidwill, president of the Arizona Cardinals and son of the team’s principal owner; Karrin Taylor Robson, who runs a land-use firm in Arizona and was appointed to the Arizona Board of Regents in 2017 by the governor; and Mr. McCain’s wife, Cindy. Her name is often mentioned, though conservatives have bristled at the prospect—a factor that could weigh on Mr. Ducey.

A spokesman for Mr. Ducey had said earlier this year that the governor wasn’t considering himself as a replacement. Though Mr. Ducey has been tight-lipped about his thinking, he waded into the fight late last year after some Republicans, including Kelli Ward, who is running for the seat being vacated by Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.), seemed to openly express an interest in taking Mr. McCain’s seat.

“To the politicians out there that have been openly lobbying for this position—they’ve basically disqualified themselves by showing their true character,” Mr. Ducey told KTAR radio in December.

Mr. Ducey visited with the McCain family in May. In other situations in which a senator dies in office, the governor consults with the family before determining a replacement.

Mr. McCain’s death further jumbles the political landscape in Arizona, which is already due to be recast with Mr. Flake’s retirement. The primary takes place on Tuesday. Ms. Ward is vying against Rep. Martha McSally (R., Ariz.) and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio to be the GOP nominee.

There also are now questions about the timing of an appointment, including whether party leaders will want to defer any public announcements until after Mr. McCain has been laid to rest.

It isn’t clear whether Mr. McCain will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda. The honor is typically reserved for presidents, although it has also been accorded to senators. The last senator to lie in state in the Rotunda was the late Sen. Dan Inouye, a Hawaii Democrat and World War II hero. Mr. McCain has said that he wants to be laid to rest along the banks of the Severn River, at the U.S. Naval Academy, instead of at Arlington National Cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried.

"PERAST, Montenegro—Vladimir Milinović has seen Western tourism in his Balkan village swell so much, he now knows who is likely to tip, and who will try to haggle down the €5 (nearly $6) he charges for a short boat ride.

“We like Americans because they are very generous,” said Mr. Milinović, as he navigated his motorboat to a picturesque island near the village called Our Lady of the Rocks. “If somebody tries to get a cheaper price we know they are probably French.”

So many tourists are descending on Europe this summer—drawn in part by the strong dollar—that a growing number are looking beyond the continent’s famous destinations, leaving hardly a spot on the map unvisited. As the lines stretch longer outside Notre-Dame in Paris, and the crush gets greater on Saint Mark’s Square in Venice, even tiny Montenegro is enjoying its place in the sun.

In well-trodden Europe, you can’t get much more off the beaten track than this Balkan country smaller than Connecticut, whose pristine beaches and landscape were relatively obscure until recently.

Conditions could hardly be better for Europe, which takes the lion’s share of global tourism revenues globally. The rising dollar and strong U.S. economy are drawing more Americans here. Russians have begun to travel again in Europe, especially in the Balkans, after a hiatus for Russia’s economic downturn. And the growing number of Chinese who visit Europe are staying longer, venturing beyond whistle-stop tours to delve more deeply into the continent’s culture offerings.

International overnight stays in Europe rose 7% in the first four months of 2018 compared with the same period last year, building on what the United Nations’ tourism organization called a “remarkable” 8% increase in 2017. Above all, Europe’s continuing economic upswing has led to strongly rising tourism within the continent, especially from Germany. Tourism industry executives expect the good times to continue.

The sector’s boom began several years ago, spurred by Europe’s emergence from its financial crisis, and has proved largely impervious to Europe’s other woes, from the migration crisis to terrorism.

With Europe remaining one of the world’s safest and most politically stable regions, destinations such as Spain and Greece have benefited from people’s security fears about vacationing in the Middle East and North Africa. Even European cities that suffered terrorist attacks in recent years, such as Paris in 2015 and Brussels in 2016, saw temporary dips in tourism before bouncing back within about a year and joining the wider boom.

The trend of tourists seeking out locations that were once considered second tier is evident even in Spain, whose 82 million foreign guests in 2017 made it the world’s second-most visited country after France. In the first half of this year, foreign tourists in Spain’s 11 least-visited regions, including the Basque Country, were about one-third higher than in the same period in 2016, while visitors to Andalusia and the Canary Islands, two of the country’s top destinations, were up a more modest 12% and 7%, respectively, in that time.

The boom is bringing back fond memories for Montenegro. It was a popular destination for Yugoslavs, but it didn’t see many foreign guests for a long time after Communism fell. Last year, 1 million tourists visited this country of 650,000 inhabitants, according to the national statistics office, a 19% rise from the year before. In the first four months of 2018, numbers were up another 20% on the year.

Tourism generated about €1 billion for Montenegro in 2017, a third of the country’s gross domestic product. In Europe, only Croatia has faster tourism growth.

Caleb Wang, a 20-year-old history student at the University of Chicago, said it never would have even occurred to him to visit Montenegro. But he ended up in the medieval town of Kotor, near Perast, on a cruise with his parents that left from Venice and followed the Croatian and Montenegrin coasts.

“I’d heard Croatia was beautiful, but I didn’t expect Montenegro would be this nice,” said Mr. Wang. “You can see why tourism is booming here.”

Montenegro is scrambling to build and refurbish hotels and improve its roads. Kotor plans to renovate the 1,350 stone steps, many in a parlous state, that lead steeply up to its formidable fortress.

The only road through Kotor, a Unesco World Heritage site with about 2,500 inhabitants that gets up to 15,000 tourists a day in high summer, is often jammed with traffic. On a recent sunny day, the old town was awash with visitors from a cruise ship.

When the first cruise ship docked at Kotor just over a decade ago, the town celebrated, and the event made the national evening television news. Now an average of a ship a day stops here. One day this August, four ships queued for a berth.

“People ask me what’s wrong if there isn’t a tour ship docked,” said Ana Nives Radović, the town’s tourism director. “The number of tourists here is still acceptable,” she said. But if there is another decade of such growth, “it might start getting out of hand.”

"Coinbase Inc., the operator of the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is setting up shop in Japan, where much of the world’s bitcoin trading takes place.

The San Francisco-based company named Nao Kitazawa, a former Morgan Stanley banker turned fintech executive, as its new Japan CEO. Coinbase said it is working with Japanese regulators to ensure it complies with local laws. It didn’t offer a time frame for when it expects to commence operations.

Coinbase, which was founded in 2012 and runs the largest U.S. digital-currency exchange by volume, said it currently operates in 32 countries including Singapore. Yet it has lacked a significant presence in Asia, one of the driving forces behind bitcoin’s surge last year.

“As a regulated, compliant crypto company in the U.S., we will focus on building that same level [of] trust with new customers in Japan,” Dan Romero, vice president and general manager of Coinbase, wrote on the company’s blog. He said the expansion was part of Coinbase’s efforts “to accelerate the global adoption of cryptocurrency.”

Japan has long been a hotbed for cryptocurrency trading. Rules that took effect in Japan last year established bitcoin as a legitimate payment method and helped the digital currency flourish in the country. About two-thirds of bitcoin trading is yen-denominated, according to data provider Coinhills.

But Japanese regulators have tightened their grip on the market in recent months, after cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc. in January lost more than $500 million in customer funds. Regulators have since suspended operations at some exchanges.

Exchange operators have had mixed success in Japan. In April, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken said it was ending its trading services for Japanese residents. Also in April, internet brokerage Monex Group Inc. said it was buying Coincheck for $34 million and aimed to fully restore its operations. Messaging-app operator Line Corp. is one of several companies waiting on regulatory approval to open a cryptocurrency exchange.

Coinbase operates a popular app that people use for storing, trading and transferring bitcoin and collects fees when customers buy or sell the cryptocurrency. At one point in December, Coinbase was the most-downloaded free app in Apple Inc.’s App Store. The company has been trying to branch out beyond its core base of U.S. individual investors, and last month unveiled plans for new services aimed at hedge funds and other big investors, such as brokering large-scale cryptocurrency trades.

The price of bitcoin recently traded at around $7,400, according to research site CoinDesk. It has lost more than half its value since peaking near $20,000 in December. Still, it is significantly higher from early 2017, when it started the year below $1,000.

"The Justice Department is seeking to reach a plea deal in its criminal investigation of the former son-in-law of Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s one-time campaign chairman, according to people familiar with the matter.

The investigation into Jeffrey Yohai—who hasn’t been charged with any crime—by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles is separate from the Washington-based probe of his former father-in-law and others by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is examining Russian influence on last year’s presidential election, some of the people familiar with the situation said.

Mr. Manafort was accused by Mr. Mueller in an indictment unsealed Oct. 30 with using a network of shell companies in the U.S. and abroad to avoid taxes and launder money, and with lying to investigators and defrauding banks on real-estate transactions. He pleaded not guilty.

Although those charges didn’t appear to directly relate to Mr. Mueller’s investigation of whether Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election, they could be an effort to gain Mr. Manafort’s cooperation, legal experts said.

Last week, federal investigators working on a possible plea deal reached out to Mr. Yohai’s attorney and to a Los Angeles-based lender, Genesis Capital LLC, which lent money to entities Mr. Yohai had created for failed house-flipping projects in which Mr. Manafort had also invested, according to some of the people. The investigation has also scrutinized at least one real-estate deal involving Mr. Yohai in New York, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.

WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains what have we learned after Special Counsel Robert Mueller unveiled his first two big actions in his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. Photo: Getty

It isn’t clear to what charges investigators want Mr. Yohai to plead guilty. Nor could it be determined whether Mr. Yohai would be charged with any wrongdoing if no deal were reached.

Aaron May, a lawyer for Mr. Yohai, said in a statement: “Mr. Yohai has not been charged with any crime nor has he entered into any plea agreements.”

Mr. Manafort’s spokesman, Jason Maloni, said in a statement: “Paul Manafort entered a plea of not guilty in response to the indictment and he looks forward to having these allegations tried before a judge and jury.”

Messrs. Manafort and Yohai worked together on real-estate deals related to multiple properties, both in Los Angeles and New York, court and real-estate records show, including some alleged to have involved loan fraud, according to Mr. Mueller’s indictment.

Mr. Yohai is referred to in Mr. Manafort’s indictment as Mr. Manafort’s son-in-law, but not by name.

Mr. Manafort’s daughter, Jessica, filed for divorce from Mr. Yohai earlier this year. Records show a divorce judgment was issued in August.

Mr. Manafort, his wife and daughter put at least $4.2 million into house-flipping projects, federal bankruptcy-court records show. Mr. Yohai put the four properties into corporate bankruptcy in December 2016, as the lender, Genesis, was moving toward foreclosure, records show.

In September, Mr. Yohai said in a federal court filing in Santa Ana, Calif. that Mr. Manafort and associates had “conspired to mislead” the judge about purchase offers that had materialized for the properties. Mr. Manafort hasn’t responded to that allegation in court filings. A spokesman for Mr. Manafort declined to comment on those allegations.

Earlier this summer, a bankruptcy judge in Santa Ana, Calif. cleared the way for a corporate entity partially owned by Mr. Manafort to buy two of the bankrupt properties, but Mr. Yohai later said in court papers that it appeared the purchaser was having trouble finding a loan. The sales failed to close by an Oct. 20 deadline, court records said.

Advertisement

Genesis was also the lender in early 2016 on a Brooklyn townhouse cited by Mr. Mueller in the indictment accusing Mr. Manafort of loan fraud. Mr. Manafort purchased the property through a corporation for nearly $3 million in 2012 using money from another entity in Cyprus, then took out loans from Genesis in early 2016, in part for construction at the property, according to real-estate records and the indictment.

Genesis got loan guarantees for the Brooklyn property from Mr. Manafort, his wife Kathleen, Mr. Yohai and Jessica Manafort, court records show.

According to the indictment, Mr. Manafort told his tax preparer that the construction loan would allow him to fully pay off the mortgage on another apartment.

After Genesis went to court to foreclose on the Brooklyn property, Mr. Manafort obtained loans from another bank based in Chicago, run by a Trump campaign adviser, and then settled the foreclosure proceedings, the Journal previously has reported.

Advertisement

Mr. Yohai was referred to in Mr. Mueller’s indictment in connection with a Manhattan condominium Mr. Manafort purchased in 2012 through a corporation for $2.85 million, which the government alleged used funds wired from entities he controlled in Cyprus.

Mr. Mueller accused Mr. Manafort of subsequently defrauding a bank when applying for a mortgage on the property. Although the property was used to generate rental income, Mr. Manafort told the bank that it was a second home for his daughter and Mr. Yohai, so he could get a greater loan amount, for $3.185 million, than he could have otherwise, the indictment says.

The indictment says that on Jan. 26, 2016, Mr. Manafort wrote to his then son-in-law about a visit from an appraiser to the condominium, saying, “[r]emember, he believes that you and” Jessica Manafort “are living there.”

"ATHENS—Wildfires raged through popular resort areas near Greece’s capital, leaving at least 74 dead and more than 100 injured, in the country’s deadliest fire season in more than a decade.

Fires fanned by strong winds broke out Monday afternoon on both sides of Athens, ripping through pine forests and towns. Tourists and residents were forced to quickly flee to beaches, where more than 800 people were picked up by coast guard and navy vessels and fishing boats.

The fires hit areas of widespread unregulated construction with narrow streets and houses mixed among tinder-dry forest, which likely contributed to the death toll. Greece’s Red Cross said the bodies of 26 people believed to be trying to escape were found near a beach, some of them hugging each other in their last moments.

Fires are common during Greece’s hot and dry summers, in part because of a lack of forest maintenance and weak zoning laws. Public spending cuts imposed during the country’s financial crisis have eaten into fire service funding and fire brigades struggle with aging equipment.

“This was a deadly mix: a mega fire, strong winds of more than 80 kilometers per hour [50 miles per hour] in an unregulated area at the peak of the tourist season,” says Yiannis Stamoulis, head of the Association of Greek Firefighters.

Even after the fires were contained, authorities said the number of casualties could rise as rescue crews check scorched areas and the coast guard conducts a search-and-rescue operation for people who may have fled by swimming or in boats.

“It will take several days, maybe even months to check all the area,” Mr. Stamoulis said. “We have to check room by room in hundreds of buildings and cars.”

In addition to the death toll, 184 were injured, including 23 children and 11 people in critical condition, a fire brigade official said. Some bodies were found just a few feet from shore or from homes that had been engulfed with little warning.

“It took people by surprise and it all happened really fast,” Ambulance Service deputy director Miltiadis Mylonas said. “The task we face now is organizing the identification of victims by members of their families.”

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared three days of mourning.

“The country is going through an unspeakable tragedy,” he said. “Nothing and no one will be forgotten.”

The Supreme Court prosecutor ordered an investigation and Mr. Tsipras said the extent of the fires raised suspicions of illegal activity.

Greece has been particularly hard-hit this year. Spain and Portugal, normally fire hot spots, have been relieved by a rainy spring and cooler summer temperatures. Spain has had one major fire as of July 15 compared with 10 during the same period last year, when dry weather conditions and high temperatures scorched the Iberian Peninsula.

The government in Lisbon has taken steps to prevent blazes before they spread after more than 100 people died in summer fires last year, including some who where trapped in their cars as they tried to flee. Lisbon has responded by increasing investments and trying to clear flammable growth.

An exodus of residents from the countryside to urban centers during the past several decades has accelerated the spread of deadly fires as fewer people control the brush, noted Javier Madrigal, who studies forest fires.

In addition, uncontrolled and unregulated urbanization in city centers has pushed people into areas that border forests, leaving their homes vulnerable.

The death toll in Greece is the largest since 2007, when fires burned in the southern Peloponnese for days, leaving more than 60 people dead.

Small fires were burning in some areas Tuesday afternoon while white smoke billowed from others. The resort town of Mati, about 20 miles east of Athens, was completely destroyed.

“Mati doesn’t even exist as a settlement anymore,” one woman who managed to escape told local TV. “I saw corpses, burned-out cars.”

Greece requested international help through the European Union, while parts of Attica, the peninsula that includes Athens, declared a state of emergency. Spain and Cyprus have offered assistance. Hundreds of firefighters from all over Greece were redeployed and the army was called in to help.

Mr. Tsipras spoke over the phone with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and several of his European counterparts, who expressed their condolences and offered help, the prime minister’s office said.

DARWIN, Australia—The past casts a long shadow over this palm-lined city on Asia’s fringe.

In February 1942, a devastating Japanese airstrike killed more than 200 people here and prompted many more to flee into the remote Outback. Together with the fall of Singapore days earlier, the attack on this “wild little tropic port,” in the words of U.S. war correspondent John Lardner, forcing a fundamental change in Australia’s outlook that its remoteness bestowed a level of safety from the world.

Three generations on, this once-isolated northern Australian outpost has transformed to a city of 150,000 with renewed military importance for the U.S. and its allies as they bolster defenses against an assertive China.

At an army base on the city’s outskirts, the largest deployment of U.S. Marines stationed in Australia in decades recently began drills aimed at preparing for any future conflict in Asia. Darwin’s location, 400 miles from the Indonesian archipelago and 1,700 miles from the South China Sea, provides what could serve as a springboard for U.S. forces in the region.

“This place is of huge importance to the United States,” said the Marines’ Darwin commander, Col. Jay Schnelle. “The Australian-America relationship underpins peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region.”

The U.S. and Australia have begun a multibillion-dollar improvement of air bases in northern Australia to accommodate stealth warplanes and long-range maritime patrol drones, and are building wharves and refueling points for visiting warships in Darwin—part of a $150 billion upgrade of Australia’s military.

Over the coming months, the Marines will embed for the first time on Australian amphibious assault ships and practice humanitarian-disaster operations and combat skills. The Marines will be joining troops from the Philippines, Japan and Pacific island countries here and on Australia’s east coast.

France, meanwhile, this month sent an amphibious task force to visit Darwin carrying British and French forces for drills alongside U.S. and Australian personnel. And India, for the first time, will send warplanes to Darwin for large-scale air exercises in July, joining aircraft from Singapore, Indonesia, the U.S., Thailand, Canada and Australia, involving thousands of personnel.

Much of the activity is a response to Chinese efforts to militarize atolls in the contested South China Sea, as Beijing modernizes its military to project power far from its shores. This month China began sea trials of its first China-made aircraft carrier and landed a heavy bomber on one of the disputed islands for the first time.

China’s arms buildup has brought a reappraisal of Darwin’s importance as a military station, a role it played during World War II and more recently as a launchpad for peacekeeping missions in East Timor.

The U.S. and Australia have ruled out permanent U.S. bases on Australian soil, wary of domestic sensitivity to foreign bases. China has criticized the growing American presence in Australia, accusing both countries of a “Cold War mentality”—and Australian officials, mindful of Beijing’s economic clout, have sought to avoid antagonizing China while maintaining the security alliance with the U.S.

China is by far Australia’s largest trading partner, with a market for natural resources that has helped make Australians among the world’s most prosperous people. Darwin today is home to large numbers of ethnic Chinese, Thai and Indonesian migrant families, and is as attuned to Asia as it is to the surrounding Outback and Australia’s major population centers thousands of miles to the south.

The city’s affinity with Asia, said Mayor Kon Vatskalis, helps to explain why a 2015 deal handing China’s Landbridge Group a 99-year lease over the city’s port attracted scant attention locally. When Washington later voiced concern that the $368 million agreement could facilitate spying on Marines, Australia rushed to tighten rules around foreign investment in critical infrastructure.

“People here don’t think China is a threat—unless they’re in defense,” said Mr. Vatskalis.

In response to China’s buildup, the U.S. has sent aircraft carriers to assert freedom-of-navigation rights in the South China Sea and the Pentagon is considering sending heavily armed Marine Corps Expeditionary Units to East Asia. Japan is bulking up antiship and antiaircraft missile batteries and unifying its army command structure to facilitate quick deployment.

For the U.S., Australia’s benefits go beyond confronting China. The alliance allows the U.S. to disperse forces and offset a lack of permanent bases in the Pacific outside Japan and South Korea, particularly for aircraft.

Northern Australia offers Marines some of the world’s largest training ranges and allows them to test equipment against tropical heat and axle-breaking terrain. It also hosts important U.S. satellite bases, as well as one of the world’s most advanced long-range radars.

The U.S. presence here has been steadily expanding since the Marines arrived in 2012 as part of the Obama administration’s pivot to Asia. This year’s rotation of almost 1,600 Marines will grow to 2,500 in the next few years.

“Since the Marines deal was first done, there is a much more pressing sense of China’s presence in Southeast Asia,” said Peter Jennings, a former Australian defense official who helped to negotiate the agreement to build up U.S. forces. “That makes Darwin even more strategic now than it was either in 2010, or even back in 1942,” said Mr. Jennings, now executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a security think tank.

Russia, too, has shown renewed interest in the region. This month, a Russian navy ship docked in Papua New Guinea for a training deployment. Russian strategic bombers visited Indonesia’s eastern Papua province late last year, putting Australia’s air force on alert.

Elsewhere to the north of Darwin, terrorism and piracy in the waters of the southern Philippines and eastern Indonesia pose security challenges, while North Korea’s missile program keeps U.S. allies in Asia in a constant state of readiness.

For 98-year-old Charlie Parrott, a veteran of the last great war in the Asia-Pacific, the Marines’ presence is reassuring.

“People can say what they like about America these days, but it’s very nice to have Marines back,” he said.

"ISTANBUL—The Turkish lira’s fall has been sudden and sharp. The cause traces back nearly a decade when the country’s leader decided to turn Turkey into something resembling China on a smaller scale, a world-class economy under one man’s firm control.

Eager to pull his nation out of an economic contraction that had marred much of the world at the start of 2009, Recep Tayyip Erdogan signed a decree easing access to foreign-exchange loans for Turkish companies.

The new rules lifted restrictions that barred companies without revenue in hard currencies from doing such borrowing—as long as the loans exceeded $5 million. “It was tantamount to saying: If you drink, drink a lot,” said one official in Ankara, Turkey’s capital.

In the following years, Turkish companies gorged on euro and dollar loans, granting Mr. Erdogan’s wish of brawny economic expansion that helped him and his ruling Justice and Development Party power through successive national and local elections. Memories of the 2009 recession evaporated, as did those of the 1990s crisis that had led Turkey to seek international assistance.

Mr. Erdogan was, in effect, mirroring in ways the approach of Chinese President Xi Jinping and his party, which consolidated political power in an authoritarian regime and encouraged heavy borrowing to supercharge the economy.

Turkey’s financial trouble shows the limitation of that approach, especially for countries more susceptible to the forces of global finance and without the kind of control exerted by China’s Communist Party. Vulnerabilities in the Turkish expansion model were so severe it took only two tweets by President Trump in recent weeks—one announcing sanctions against two Turkish officials and another on the doubling of some tariffs—to spark panic.

Nonfinancial corporations built a $330 billion debt pile that is now at the heart of global investor concerns over Turkey’s perilous financial situation. Compounded by a protracted dispute with the U.S. over the fate of an American pastor, those concerns have caused a currency debacle, with the Turkish lira collapsing to its lowest level ever against the dollar on Monday.

Although the lira pared some of its losses, it has shed roughly a third of its value against the dollar since the start of the year. On Friday, the lira sank more than 4% against the dollar after the U.S. administration threatened new penalties against the country over its detention of the pastor, Andrew Brunson. In late European trading Friday, a dollar bought 6.12 lira; a month ago, it bought 4.75.

The lira’s drop has sent ripples through the global financial system, raising concerns about the exposure of some European banks and denting investor appetite for emerging markets.

“It feels like going back to the 1990s,” when a deep Turkish financial crisis had ripple effects on global finance, said Zumrut Imamoglu, chief economist at Tusiad, one of Turkey’s leading industry and business-lobbying groups.

Among businessmen caught on the wrong side of the lira is Atilla Kulekcioglu. In April, Citir Usta, the food chain he founded in 2003, filed for protection from creditors over debt of more than 10 million lira. Mr. Kulekcioglu said he had always resisted the temptation of contracting foreign-currency loans because clients pay in lira for the pide, a Turkish dish similar to flatbread he serves at his restaurants.

Yet, the shopping malls that house his outlets, built on the back of euro or dollar loans, charge rents indexed on foreign currencies, he said. Unable to pass on the higher rent costs to his customers, Mr. Kulekcioglu said he closed 25 of his 65 restaurants and began scouting for foreign investors. “We were one of the four biggest chains in the sector,” he said.

Investor concerns over Turkey’s vulnerable finances have long been pervasive, especially as Mr. Erdogan consolidated his one-man rule and increased his sway over the central bank and monetary policy. In the spring, Mr. Erdogan called snap elections. And in June, he won a new five-year mandate that came with expanded executive powers, securing his political future before those concerns took hold.

The currency storm was a far cry from Mr. Erdogan’s electoral promise to place Turkey among the world’s top 10 economies by the end of his term from its current rank of 17th. As the lira storm raged last weekend, the president was touring the Black Sea region, delivering speeches to thank voters for his re-election. He made no mention of the corporate-debt challenge. Rather, he denounced the tariffs the U.S. has introduced on some Turkish imports as an “act of economic war.”

“Once again, we are facing a surreptitious political plot,” he told supporters in the Black Sea town of Trabzon on Sunday. “God permitting, we will overcome this.”

On Thursday, Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak—Mr. Erdogan’s son-in-law—said on a conference call with about 3,000 investors and financial analysts that the lira rout was excessive and didn’t reflect Turkey’s core economic strength.

Economists say years of heavy corporate borrowing, during which liquidity minted by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks met Mr. Erdogan’s thirst for higher economic growth, has reached a limit.

Refet Gurkaynak, a professor of economics at the Bilkent University in Ankara, said souring U.S. relations were a trigger that awakened investors to the reality of Turkey’s financial pain.

“The problem here is that our corporate sector is deeply, deeply indebted,” he said, warning of a looming rise in defaults and layoffs. “You can’t dump all the corporate problems on the banks, so there will have to be some sharing of the problems by the banks and the government, hence the public.”

Turkish officials didn’t reply to messages seeking comment. During his call with investors, Mr. Albayrak said the government would announce a detailed action plan in September.

At the start of his national political career, Mr. Erdogan cut a more accommodating figure. When he became prime minister in 2003, Turkey was two years into a bailout plan run by the International Monetary Fund, receiving billions of dollars of loans in exchange for implementing the fund’s recipe of fiscal and budget rigor.

Carrying out the remaining IMF measures, Turkey reaped the benefits with lower inflation and a jump in exports, becoming a darling of emerging-market investors. Europeans greeted Mr. Erdogan as a strategic partner and, in December 2004, the European Union formally granted Turkey the right to begin accession talks, kicking off large aid and investment programs.

At a conference around that time at the European Parliament, Franco-German lawmaker Daniel Cohn-Bendit walked up to the Turkish leader, video of the meeting shows. “Mr. Erdogan, I have a present for you,” the lawmaker said, handing him a coin. “The first euro in Turkish.”

With the flow of money, Turkey became a construction site, as Mr. Erdogan, who had developed a penchant for infrastructure projects when he was Istanbul’s mayor in the 1990s, launched train, highway and bridge projects. Istanbul’s skyline, which counted 19 high-rises when he became prime minister, now has 98, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, a Chicago-based nonprofit.

In 2007, his honeymoon with the EU took a hit. Several European leaders, such as then-President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, publicly said they would veto Turkey’s membership to the bloc.

In 2008, the IMF assistance program expired. Mr. Erdogan minimized the fund’s role, instead crediting his own stewardship for Turkey’s economic miracle and vowing to follow his own course.

Durmus Yilmaz, an opposition lawmaker, said Mr. Erdogan and his ruling AKP party began behaving more confidently. “After 2008, they felt they knew better,” said Mr. Yilmaz, a former governor of Turkey’s central bank.

That is when the global recession hit Turkey. In the first quarter of 2009, the Turkish economy shrank more than 13%. The government switched to expansionary measures such as the easing on foreign-currency loans.

Within months, the Turkish economy was back on its feet. Mr. Erdogan wanted more growth and didn’t reduce budget spending. “With demand increasing a lot in an economy that was already at full capacity,” said Mr. Gurkaynak, the economics professor, “we began to run the humongous current-account deficit and inflation began to creep up.”

In May 2013, then Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan boasted that Turkey had finished paying its $23.5 billion IMF debt. “For the first time in 19 years, Turkey owes no debt to the IMF,” Mr. Babacan said after initiating the final wire transfers from a computer at Turkey’s central-bank headquarters.

Two weeks later, two tremors shook Turkey. One came from the U.S., where then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled in an address to Congress that years of Fed stimulus might come to an end. For Turkey, the message was a warning that the days of easy access to foreign funding, vital to plugging holes in its current account, could be numbered.

The other occurred in Istanbul, where a small sit-in protesting the destruction of the tree-lined Gezi park escalated into nationwide, often-violent protests against Mr. Erdogan’s increasingly authoritarian rule.

Mr. Bernanke’s speech and the political upheaval weighed on the lira, which lost ground against the dollar, heightening pressure on the Turkish central bank to raise interest rates. But Mr. Erdogan vetoed a rate increase. In a series of speeches in June, he blamed what he called “the interest-rate lobby” for the Gezi protests and negative pressure on the lira.

“He believes the economy works in a way that is different from what the faculty says” in economic literature, said Mr. Yilmaz, the former central-bank governor.

After a failed coup in July 2016, the Turkish economy shrank abruptly. The emergency rule introduced by the government spooked foreign companies, which sharply cut direct investment.

Last year, the government dramatically expanded its support to small companies through a state fund that guaranteed bank loans worth about 200 billion lira in total, up from about 15 billion in 2016. Economists say the move helped turbocharge the Turkish economy to a growth rate of 7.4% in 2017, the highest of all Group of 20 economies.

At the start of 2018, the lira was falling on simmering concerns over Turkey’s large corporate debt. Some of the president’s advisers talked on television about the need to cool Turkey’s economic engine after such a bewildering run.

But surrounded by businessmen in a hall of the presidential complex in April, Mr. Erdogan distributed framed “incentive certificates” as he announced another $34 billion stimulus program.

“Some people say ‘too much growth is not a good thing,’ ” he said. “Why? Because they are jealous. It is nothing else.”

The fallout has been harsh on companies such as partly state-owned Turk Telekom , Turkey’s largest phone operator. Last month, it blamed a second-quarter net loss of 889 million lira on “unfavorable forex movements,” saying almost all of its bank borrowings, which stood at 14.7 billion lira as of June 30, were in dollars and euros. Stripping out those effects, it said, it would have posted a net profit of 676 million lira.

“Turk Telekom has debt in foreign currencies but this is at a manageable level and actually is a low amount,” a Turk Telekom spokeswoman said Friday.

Having announced this spring his intention to seek a new mandate, Mr. Erdogan hit the campaign trail. He promised that a landmark mosque in Istanbul and the city’s new airport, cast as the world’s biggest, would soon be completed. He announced details of a grand project to connect the Black and Marmara seas with a canal that would house a population of seven million along its banks.

In May, the lira’s drop intensified after the president told a London conference he intended to have a bigger say in monetary policy in the future. In a bid to support the Turkish currency, the central bank sharply raised interest rates. That same month, the government reintroduced most of the restrictions on foreign-currency loans it had lifted in 2009.

“That was too late,” said Ms. Imamoglu, the Tusiad economist. “They should have done it before 2015.”

"Newly announced U.S. sanctions—and the potential for a second round of actions in 90 days—roiled Russia’s currency and blue-chip stocks as the country braced for further economic pain amid uncertainties over the Trump administration’s commitment to enforcement.

In Moscow, the ruble shed as much as 5% against the dollar on Thursday and stocks plunged as much as 9%, led by state banks and national carrier PJSC Aeroflot-Russian Airlines , which risk losing access to U.S. markets if the sanctions escalate. In Washington, the administration remained notably silent on the action and offered few details on the severity of the prospective punishments.

The sanctions stem from a March nerve-agent attack against a former Russian spy in the U.K. The U.S. and Britain have held Russia responsible for the attack. Moscow has repeatedly denied involvement.

The sanctions are mandated by a U.S. law that requires action over the use of chemical and biological weapons—but President Trump maintains significant discretionary power over the degree of that punishment.

A spokesman for President Vladimir Putin of Russia struck a cautious tone and said Moscow remained committed to building “constructive relations with the U.S.” and wouldn’t draft countermeasures before learning the full details.

Others in the country expressed alarm and dismay over the U.S. move, which threatened to diminish hopes of improved bilateral ties.

Lawmakers from Russia’s ruling party accused U.S. politicians of treating the country like a punching bag in their partisan infighting and in midterm campaigning. On state television, analysts and commentators lamented Mr. Trump’s inability to push through a hostile Congress a reset in relations with Russia following a summit with Mr. Putin in Helsinki in July.

The head of the foreign-relations committee of Russia’s Senate, Konstantin Kosachev, compared the new sanctions to a “lynching.”

“The U.S. is once again behaving like a police state, beating out evidence from suspects by threats and torture,” he told Interfax.

The Kremlin, meanwhile, repeated its previous denial of any involvement in the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in southern England this year, while playing down the importance of the sanctions.

As a volatile day unfolded in Moscow, response from Washington was muted. Mr. Trump made no public comments on the matter, and communications aides referred all questions to the State Department, which said the U.S. still sought improved ties with Moscow.

Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the administration had “complied with the law” and would continue to do so, but added: “We’d like to have a better relationship with the Russian government, recognizing that we have a lot of areas of mutual concern.”

The measures announced Wednesday constitute the first tranche of sanctions dictated by U.S. law. A second tranche of sanctions would take effect within three months unless the president certifies to Congress that Russia has met three conditions: ceasing the use of chemical and biological weapons; credibly assuring the U.S. that it won’t use such weapons in the future; and submitting to inspections by international observers to ensure compliance.

Should Russia fail to meet these criteria, the president has discretion over the severity of the next measures, requiring Mr. Trump to impose at least three of six types of additional sanctions. These include opposing any loans or other assistance to Russia by international-development banks; barring U.S. banks from issuing loans or extending credit to the Russian government; prohibiting exports of goods and technology to Russia; restricting imports of Russian goods; downgrading or suspending diplomatic relations with Russia; and suspending the authorization of Russian-owned or controlled air carriers to fly into and out of the U.S.

A spate of Western sanctions against Russia since Mr. Putin’s decision to annex Crimea in 2014 have wiped out half of the ruble’s value, reduced investment in the energy sector and crippled aluminum giant United Co. Rusal PLC.

The State Department declined on Thursday to provide further details on how the administration planned to tailor the potential second round of sanctions.

“That’s asking us to look into the future, and we don’t know what the future holds. That’s a hypothetical question,” Ms. Nauert told reporters.

The sanctions drew praise from House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R., Calif.), who has urged the administration to respond to the poisoning.

In a March 15 letter to the president, Mr. Royce requested a formal determination of Russian responsibility and imposition of sanctions. The congressman sent a second missive on July 26, noting that the administration had exceeded the 60-day statutory limit for making this determination and urging submission of the required report to the committee by noon on Aug. 9.

“The administration is rightly acting to uphold international bans on the use of chemical weapons,” Mr. Royce said on Wednesday. “The mandatory sanctions that follow this determination are key to increasing pressure on Russia.”

But some still questioned the administration’s overall policy toward Russia after months of sometimes conflicting statements and actions.

Heather Conley, a former deputy assistant secretary of state in the Bureau for European and Eurasian Affairs in Republican George W. Bush’s administration, characterized the latest move as emblematic of a “broader incoherence” in the U.S. approach to Russia.

Ms. Conley, who serves as senior vice president for Europe, Eurasia, and the Arctic at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted the two countries “don’t have that much bilateral trade, and what we do have is protected trade.” In light of those limitations, she said, the objective of the sanctions is uncertain.

“The interagency process is always tortured, on a good day,” she said. “But it’s starting to break down to a point where I’m actually very concerned we don’t have a coherent process anymore. And if we’re confusing ourselves, the signals that we’re sending to the Kremlin are very confused, may be misinterpreted, and can also lead to an escalation that we didn’t anticipate, either.”

"WASHINGTON—A top commander of U.S. military operations in Syria said he wasn’t informed of any agreements President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin reached at their summit this week.

Joseph Votel, commander of U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for the Middle East, said Thursday in a briefing with reporters that he had “no new guidance as a result of Helsinki,” the site of Monday’s summit. Syria was among the topics Messrs. Trump and Putin said they discussed.

...",world
"Donald Trump meets Vladimir Putin Monday in Helsinki, and if the U.S. President has an agenda beyond dominating the headlines and taunting his domestic opponents, it isn’t apparent. That won’t be the case with Mr. Putin, who has spent 18 months sizing up the American President and will be looking to get the most out of a weak Russian hand.

In 18 years running Russia, Mr. Putin has outfoxed two previous U.S. Presidents who sought better relations. The Russian makes promises to win concessions but then typically reneges or moves to exploit what he perceives as U.S. weakness. George W. Bush at least negotiated the end of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that stifled missile defenses, but Mr. Putin rolled over Barack Obama like T-14 tanks in a Ukrainian corn field.

So let’s assess the summit in advance by what Mr. Putin wants now from Mr. Trump. The U.S. President considers himself a shrewd negotiator, so we can measure the results by how much of the Putin agenda the former KGB operative gets Mr. Trump to concede.

• Prestige. Mr. Putin’s top priority at all times is shoring up his political standing at home, where he lacks democratic legitimacy. This means striding the world stage as if Russia is again a global power, and Mr. Trump is helping Mr. Putin on this score merely by meeting him on equal terms. The Russian will also want Mr. Trump to endorse Mr. Putin’s denials about meddling in the 2016 election—which he will advertise as official absolution.

Mr. Putin has been persona non grata in Europe since he invaded Crimea in 2014, and he wants Mr. Trump’s help with rehabilitation. Expect Mr. Putin to flatter Mr. Trump for his willingness to disrupt global norms. He’ll also want Mr. Trump to repeat his recent comments that Mr. Putin should rejoin the G-7.

• Syria. Mr. Putin has accomplished what he sought when he barged into Syria in 2015. He’s saved Bashar Assad, fortified long-term military bases, and replaced the U.S. as chief power broker in the region. He wants Mr. Trump to validate these gains and withdraw U.S. troops from eastern Syria.

In return Mr. Putin may promise to help the U.S. contain Iran’s presence in Syria, though there’s no guarantee he can do so, given Iran’s investment in Mr. Assad. The Russian knows Mr. Trump is eager to bring U.S. troops home and might rely on assurances on Iran the way he did on the “de-escalation” zone in southwestern Syria. Mr. Putin has helped Mr. Assad bomb the opposition in that part of Syria despite the Russian’s assurances.

• Ukraine. Mr. Putin wants Mr. Trump to accept his Crimea annexation, perhaps in return for recommitting to the Minsk negotiation process for eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces started another illegal war. Mr. Trump has already blamed Barack Obama for losing Crimea, essentially a unilateral concession that Mr. Putin will pocket. The Russian will also try to get Mr. Trump to stop providing Kiev with lethal weapons.

• Lifting sanctions. This is Mr. Putin’s top near-term priority. He needs to be able to enrich his cronies, and U.S. and European sanctions have become a major problem. The Russian will play to Mr. Trump’s dislike for the European Union by suggesting Mr. Trump can come to an independent deal over Ukraine, Syria and sanctions. Mr. Putin knows that the Italian, Hungarian and Greek governments are wobbly on sanctions, and he’d like Mr. Trump to stir more dissension in the EU.

• The trans-Atlantic alliance. Mr. Putin knows that the stronger NATO is as a military force, the riskier it is for him to engage in foreign adventurism. The Russian’s long-term goal is to erode the West’s political will to add to its capabilities as the memories of Crimea fade. Mr. Putin will do whatever he can in Helsinki to underscore Mr. Trump’s frustration with Europe that was on display this week at the NATO summit, planting the seeds of future discord.

• Arms control. Mr. Trump has been floating the idea of new arms talks with Russia, though over what isn’t clear. No doubt Mr. Putin’s spies have told him that Mr. Trump wants to be known as a nuclear peacemaker. And Mr. Putin may try to exploit that desire by offering a new round of talks to reduce the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals.

The problem here is that the Pentagon believes Mr. Putin is violating his current arms treaties with the U.S. This includes deploying intermediate-range cruise missiles in Europe that are banned under the 1987 INF Treaty. But that might not stop Mr. Trump from thinking he can change Mr. Putin’s behavior.

"Global wheat prices have soared to multiyear highs as a heat wave sweeping across Europe and Asia slashes forecasts for this year’s harvest.

The price rise could potentially provide some relief to North American farmers, who have largely avoided such scorching weather, just as Chinese tariffs sap demand for other crops like soybeans.

Chicago wheat futures hit three-year highs Thursday, while a key European benchmark topped a four-year high. The price of Paris-traded milling wheat has leapt 33% so far this year. That is already translating into more expensive animal feed in some regions and could eventually mean more expensive bread.

Hot temperatures and drought typically stunt the growth of cereals and reduce their quality. With this in mind, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has forecast that global wheat stockpiles will fall for the first time since 2013.

So far, most agricultural analysts say this wheat-stunting summer is an aberration. But the prospect of global warming has led some observers to predict an eventual shakeup for farming in parts of the world.

“Dry weather across the board has stifled yields,” said Tracey Allen, agricultural commodities strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “We’ve certainly seen dry conditions in Europe compounded by earlier issues with the Black Sea crop drawing down inventories quite quickly.”

She added that the U.S. is well-placed to increase its export share of the global market in 2018 and 2019.

After years of over-supply, this year’s heat is hitting wheat yields in key growing areas like Russia, Ukraine, France and Britain, while also affecting the crop in Australia, China and other parts of Asia.

The U.K. has had its hottest summer in four decades, while parts of southern Europe are expected to break record temperatures this weekend and Beijing in June sweltered in the hottest weather in half a century.

It’s unusual for Europe to experience such a scorching summer. The unseasonable heat “has been going at least a couple of months, and it’s been between 7 and 10 degrees [Fahrenheit] above normal over the last month,” said Donald Keeney, senior agricultural meteorologist at weather consultancy Radiant Solutions.

In Southeast Asia, a wave of El Niño weather systems—characterized by hotter-than-normal waters in tropical Pacific Ocean regions and less precipitation in Southeast Asia and eastern Australia—has prompted warmer, drier weather in key growing regions in recent months.

Wheat is typically harvested between June and September in Europe, and the harvest data so far has suggested shortfalls. The International Grains Council last month slashed its production forecast for European Union wheat in 2018-2019 to just shy of 140 million metric tons, down from 148.3 million tons in March.

“There is no end to the dire EU drought,” research firm AgResource Co. said in a recent note. “The bull story in world wheat is just unfolding.”

Less wheat from other parts of the world is a boon for U.S. and Canadian exporters, who are expected to produce better crops this year. The ratio of global grain supply, both wheat and corn, relative to demand has never been lower, AgResource said.

In the coming days, farmer Ryan Wagner will start harvesting his wheat in Day County, S.D. “It’s a good spot to be in if you have a good crop and there’s a shortage in another part of the world,” he said.

The jump in wheat prices comes at a difficult time for U.S. farmers, after China slapped tariffs on American grain and oil-seed imports. While the price of other agricultural commodities like soybeans have fallen, wheat traders have been largely unaffected as buyers look to them to make up shortfalls elsewhere.

It’s the opposite for Western Europe’s farmers, who had already suffered from low-cost competition from the Black Sea region. Grain levels have fallen so low in Germany that its farmers are unsure if they have enough feed for their livestock, according to the International Grains Council.

U.K. farmers are slaughtering some of their cattle earlier than usual and feeding others hay that normally wouldn’t be used until the winter, according to the British Broadcasting Corp.

Western Europe’s troubles follow on from sustained dry weather in the Black Sea region, which incorporates parts of Russia, Ukraine and Romania.

Market participants believe that while European prices may have peaked, Chicago futures have further to climb.

“I don’t think [U.S.] farmers recognize the extent of the opportunity they have, but it’s going to be very big,"" said AgResource’s Ben Buckner. “If everyone comes to the U.S. in November, it could be incredible, and that part hasn’t yet been fully digested.”",world

"WASHINGTON—When Jean-Claude Juncker arrived at the White House on Wednesday, he had no idea how the meeting with President Donald Trump would end.

When asked on his flight from Brussels whether he was ready, after having pored through piles of documents stacked in blue folders, the European Commission president smiled and said: “No. We’ll have to see how it goes.”

Once Mr. Juncker entered the Oval Office, it was clear Mr. Trump was in a mood to negotiate, said a senior European Union official who was present. Mr. Trump, who typically entertains a question or two from reporters during Oval Office visits, took none, looking instead to dive into discussions with the visiting delegation from the EU’s executive arm.

What followed between the two leaders ushered in a potentially significant de-escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and EU, after months in which the Trump administration had applied tariffs on European steel, and threatened more. The resulting agreement was vague, but the two sides agreed to pursue a range of possibilities—including increased U.S. exports of natural gas and soybeans—that might address the trans-Atlantic trade imbalance.

In recent international meetings, such as the Group of Seven summit in Canada, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels, Mr. Trump grabbed headlines with an argumentative approach. But on Wednesday, the American president was “charming, well-briefed” and “made an effort” to reach a deal with his European counterpart, the senior EU official said.

Mr. Juncker grabbed the opportunity to argue that both sides need to refrain from further punitive tariffs or they would foolishly harm themselves.

“If you want to be stupid,” he told Mr. Trump, “I can be stupid, as well.”

Backing up his points, Mr. Juncker flipped through more than a dozen colorful cue cards with simplified explainers, the senior EU official said. Each card had at most three figures about a specific topic, such as trade in cars or standards for medical devices.

“We knew this wasn’t an academic seminar,” the EU official said. “It had to be very simple.”

The Europeans had an ally on Mr. Trump’s team in White House, chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow. On Wednesday morning, before the meeting, he had told the television program “Fox & Friends,” “I just say, keep an open mind—you might be surprised by the outcome of this meeting.”

Mr. Kudlow had met with a member of Mr. Juncker’s team the previous evening and hinted at a possible deal over Diet Cokes at a D.C. hotel.

Still, when EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Wednesday morning, odds of an agreement looked remote. Mr. Lighthizer seemed unaware of the overture made by Mr. Kudlow the night before and insisted on issues that were a no-go for the Europeans, such as opening the entire agricultural sector to U.S. firms, the EU official said.

Mr. Kudlow seemed to “have the ear of the president,” the EU official said.

Mr. Juncker stuck closely to the negotiating mandate handed to him by leaders of big EU countries including Germany, France and the Netherlands. Germany, which is heavily dependent on exports, was from the onset open to a trade arrangement, including abolishing EU tariffs on U.S. car imports. France, meanwhile, was vehemently opposed to opening EU agricultural markets.

Mr. Juncker told Mr. Trump and Mr. Lighthizer that any talk of including agriculture would kill prospects of a deal. He countered with a threat to drag public procurement into negotiations, which would question the Buy American Act, a nonstarter for the U.S. side.

At one point, talk shifted to Europe buying more U.S. natural gas, a move EU leaders had agreed to take back in May, even though U.S. gas, shipped liquefied, is as much as 20% more expensive than gas Europe buys via pipeline from Russia. The Europeans said U.S. companies need licenses to sell overseas, which inflates prices. Mr. Trump proposed scrapping licenses, the EU official said. Administration officials jumped in to nix the idea, saying licenses are vital for national security. Instead, the two sides agreed to negotiate license exemptions.

When a deal looked near after almost three hours of talks, Mr. Trump said he wanted to hold a joint news conference and announce the good news. Mr. Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disappeared for more than half an hour in a room to fine-tune the language of the joint statement, U.S. and EU officials said.

“Suddenly Trump came out into our group and asked, ‘So, where are we now? Where is the statement?’ ” the EU official said. “We said, ‘We haven’t seen it yet, because your people are still negotiating among themselves.’ ”

U.S. officials were ironing out some disagreements about the wording of the statement, a person familiar with the discussions said. White House aides occasionally urged them to speed things so the two presidents could make a televised statement.

Outside the Cabinet Room, where the meetings took place, the push to stage the unplanned announcement was under way. White House officials and Marines in dress uniform worked quickly to set up podiums and display the U.S. and EU flags at the edge of the Rose Garden. Journalists were called to the event with little warning or information and stood in the garden for close to an hour, waiting for any sign of the U.S. and EU officials.

All the while, the lawmakers who had been scheduled to meet the president that afternoon to discuss his proposed aid to farmers, were escorted out to the Rose Garden so they too could watch the announcement.

The main elements of the agreement that emerged had been floated by the Europeans, prodded by Germany, two months earlier in the hope that Mr. Trump would refrain from imposing tariffs on European steel and aluminum. Mr. Juncker said after the meeting that the agreement was significant because “we were never in a position to agree on these main elements before.”

Mr. Juncker said he trusts Mr. Trump to stick to the elements of the agreement. “We have a good personal relation,” he said.

Last week, Mr. Trump called the EU America’s “foe” and vowed “tremendous retribution” if his meeting with the EU officials didn’t lead to what he considers to be a fair auto-trade deal.

But his remarks in the Rose Garden struck a conciliatory tone. He mentioned nothing about deficits, trade imbalances or auto tariffs. Often focused on putting America first, he called for making “trade fairer and more reciprocal.”

After the announcement with Mr. Juncker, the president arrived victorious to a closed-door meeting with Republican lawmakers, said Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas, who attended. Lawmakers shared specific concerns with the president and said they were worried about farmers back home. Specifically, lawmakers talked about soybeans and cherries being held up at ports in China.

“He seemed legitimately concerned,” said Mr. Conaway, chair of the House agriculture committee. “He will keep negotiating.”

In comments Thursday, Mr. Trump said he wanted to “personally thank” Mr. Juncker for his work on the agreement. “He’s a very tough, very smart, very good man. Of course, If I didn’t make a deal with him, I wouldn’t be saying that,” Mr. Trump joked.

"The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether a fugitive Malaysian financier laundered tens of millions of dollars through two associates and used the funds to pay a U.S. legal team that includes former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and a lawyer who represents President Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.

Jho Low, the Malaysian businessman, has been described in U.S. court filings as playing a central role in the alleged embezzlement of $4.5 billion from a Malaysian fund called 1Malaysia Development Bhd.

Malaysian authorities this week separately charged Mr. Low with money laundering in the case, which investigators suspect may be one of the biggest financial frauds in history. He has been moving around Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China in recent months, according to people with knowledge of his whereabouts.

The Justice Department, in July 2016 and last year, filed civil lawsuits in federal court in California seeking to recover assets from Mr. Low and others including mansions, artwork and a yacht allegedly bought with 1MDB funds. It is now pursuing a criminal investigation in which Mr. Low, who has U.S. assets, is a target, these people said.

The team of lawyers and consultants working for Mr. Low includes Mr. Christie, who briefly headed Mr. Trump’s presidential transition team; Mr. Trump’s longtime lawyer Marc Kasowitz; Bobby Burchfield, a lawyer who has served as the Trump Organization’s outside ethics adviser; and Ed Rogers, a Washington lobbyist with close ties to the Republican Party.

Mr. Low was close to former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who unexpectedly lost an election in May and was arrested last month in Kuala Lumpur. Mr. Najib has pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering and criminal breach of trust in connection with the 1MDB scandal.

Since 2016, Mr. Low’s access to the global financial system has been sharply curtailed by banks wary of handling allegedly tainted funds, according to the people familiar with the matter. That has made it difficult for him to pay directly for a range of outlays, from lifestyle expenses to legal and advisory services, according to these people.

There is no indication that any of the people who ultimately received payments were aware the funds could have originated from money Mr. Low allegedly siphoned off from 1MDB. The Justice Department is investigating Mr. Low’s potential use of two intermediaries to facilitate the payments through the international financial system, people familiar with the matter say. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.

Representatives for Mr. Low didn’t respond to a request for comment. He has previously denied wrongdoing.

Illustration: Oliver Osborne for The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Christie is representing Mr. Low in the asset-forfeiture cases in California, a spokesman for the former governor said. “There has been no communication by Governor Christie with any other area of government on Mr. Low’s behalf,” the spokesman said, adding there has been “no inquiry made to him by the Department of Justice with regard to any other investigation regarding funding or otherwise.""

A spokesman for Kasowitz Benson Torres, Mr. Kasowitz’s New York law firm, confirmed the firm represents Mr. Low in Justice Department matters. “Here, as with all of our clients, our job as attorneys is to represent and vindicate our clients’ interests; and here, as with all of our non-pro-bono clients, we are paid for the legal services we provide,” the spokesman said in a statement.

Mr. Burchfield said, in an emailed statement, that Mr. Low retained his Atlanta-based firm, King & Spalding, to “advise him on the ongoing investigations,” adding that the law firm “performed appropriate due diligence on sources of payment.”

“Further, neither I nor King & Spalding has had contacts with any governmental entity, directly or indirectly, on behalf of Mr. Low, nor has King & Spalding received any inquiries from the Department of Justice regarding this engagement,” Mr. Burchfield said.

Mr. Rogers declined to comment.

The Justice Department is looking into whether a Thai businessman, Phengphian Laogumnerd, and American former rap artist Pras Michel, a founding member of the Fugees hip-hop group, played roles in helping Mr. Low make payments, the people familiar with the matter said.

For at least a year, these people say, Mr. Low has relied on Mr. Phengphian to pay accommodation expenses in Hong Kong and Macau, legal and advisory bills and to keep Mr. Low’s $250 million yacht, Equanimity, fully staffed and maintained until it was seized earlier this month. Justice Department investigators are examining records and money flows related to a series of companies controlled by Mr. Phengphian in Hong Kong and in offshore havens such as the British Virgin Islands to determine whether Mr. Low’s money was involved, the people said.

The Thai businessman also handled payments of tens of millions of dollars to Mr. Low’s lead law firm and advisers, New York-based Kobre & Kim LLP, and British reputation law firm Schillings International LLP, according to the people familiar with the investigation.

“We do not comment on any specific financial arrangements with our clients due to the commercial confidentiality and privileged nature of such information,” said Robin Rathmell, who has identified himself as Mr. Low’s global counsel at Kobre & Kim. Partners at Schillings didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A representative for Mr. Phengphian said his client “is an independently wealthy businessman. The source of his income is nothing to do with—and he has not received any money from—Mr. Low.”

Newsletter Sign-up

The representative added: “What he chooses to do with his own funds is his business alone. The Department of Justice has never contacted him about anything, neither have they ever asked him about the source of his funds.”

Mr. Michel was responsible for bringing on another consultant to work on Mr. Low’s behalf: Republican fundraiser and venture-capital executive Elliott Broidy, who was vice chairman of the Trump campaign’s joint fund with the Republican Party during the 2016 presidential campaign. The route of any payments to Mr. Broidy also are part of the Justice Department probe, the people said.

Mr. Broidy’s lawyer has previously said Mr. Broidy and his wife were hired by Mr. Michel “to provide strategic advice as part of a broader team to Mr. Low.”

A lawyer for Mr. Michel said: “I do not know what, if anything, the Department of Justice is currently reviewing, but I am confident that Mr. Michel has not done anything improper.”

The public-integrity section of the Justice Department is separately investigating some of the lobbying work on behalf of Mr. Low, including whether Mr. Broidy attempted to sell his influence in the Trump administration to Mr. Low, who in turn was allegedly acting as an agent of the Malaysian and Chinese governments, people familiar with the investigations said.

A lawyer for Mr. Broidy said: “Elliott Broidy has never agreed to work for, been retained by nor been compensated by any foreign government for any interaction with the United States Government, ever.”

Mr. Low has been seeking to influence the administration to drop its investigations into him and 1MDB, according to people familiar with Mr. Low’s dealings and the Justice Department investigations. The Justice Department investigations overlap and involve some of the same investigators, the people familiar with them said. The Washington Post first reported on the public-integrity investigation.

"TOKYO—Japan is studying restrictions on Chinese telecommunications-equipment companies Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. ZTCOY 2.43% as U.S. fears of cyberspying by Beijing prod allies to follow suit.

U.S. officials have been arguing that using equipment from the two companies in network infrastructure constitutes a security risk. Australia last week banned both Chinese companies from its next-generation mobile network. A July study by the U.K. government said it found “shortcomings” in Huawei’s engineering processes that exposed new risks.

Officials responsible for cybersecurity in the Japanese government’s Cabinet Office said they have begun to study whether tighter regulations are needed to reduce the risk of infiltration through imported equipment, including equipment made by the Chinese companies. One of the officials said Japan was aware of other countries’ moves but would make a decision about regulation on its own.

Tokyo’s study is still preliminary and nothing concrete has been decided, officials said. A representative of ZTE declined to comment. A Huawei spokesman declined to comment.

In response to earlier criticism, Huawei has said that its equipment is safe. It says it is owned by its employees and operates independently from the government in Beijing. In the U.K., Huawei says it is working to address the government’s concerns.

Huawei and ZTE together accounted for roughly 9% of Japan’s telecom-equipment market in 2017, according to IHS Markit Technology.

Huawei doesn’t disclose its Japanese sales figures. It employed more than 950 people in Japan as of last year and has partnered with major Japanese electronics companies, according to the website.

Japan is racing to roll out so-called fifth generation networks next year, ahead of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Japan’s carriers are already placing orders for software and equipment that they spent years developing with Huawei, analysts said. Japan’s biggest cellphone carrier, NTT DoCoMo Inc., as well as the No. 3 carrier, the Japanese mobile unit of SoftBank Group Corp. , say they have conducted field trials with Huawei, in accordance with instructions from Japan’s communications ministry.

If no action is taken, Huawei, the world’s largest supplier of telecom equipment, looks poised to reap big rewards after it identified Japan as a key market in its ambition to set the standard on network technology more than a decade ago. The faster networks are expected to better connect vehicles, homes, banks, and infrastructure.

“The safety [of Huawei and ZTE equipment] has been demonstrated,” SoftBank mobile executive Jun Shimba said at a news conference Wednesday. Asked about possible government action against the companies, he said SoftBank would “conduct serious discussions” with regulators.

"Chinese navy ships off Alaska in recent days weren’t just operating in the area for the first time: They also came within 12 nautical miles of the coast, making a rare foray into U.S. territorial waters, according to the Pentagon.

Pentagon officials said late Thursday that the five Chinese navy ships had passed through U.S. territorial waters as they transited the Aleutian Islands, but said they had complied with international law and didn’t do anything threatening.

“This was a legal transit of U.S. territorial seas conducted in accordance with the Law of the Sea Convention,” said Pentagon spokesman Cmdr. Bill Urban.

U.S. officials said there was no known official communication to the U.S. from the ships.

The passage was seen as significant as Beijing has long objected to U.S. Navy vessels transiting its territorial waters or operating in international waters just outside.

China’s Defense Ministry confirmed that its navy ships had sailed to the Bering Sea for training after joint exercises with Russia in late August, but said the activity was routine and not aimed at any particular country.

U.S. officials said earlier that they were tracking the five ships in the area, where they hadn’t seen the Chinese navy operating before, but they didn’t say how close the ships had come to U.S. territory.

The foray, just as President Barack Obama was visiting Alaska, threw a fresh spotlight on China’s expanding naval power and ambitions on the eve of a lavish military parade in Beijing. It also came just three weeks before China’s President, Xi Jinping, begins a state visit to the U.S. already clouded by tensions over alleged cyberattacks on the U.S. and China’s island-building in the South China Sea.

TK

The flotilla apparently traveled east from somewhere near Russia and entered the Bering Sea, navigating north of the Aleutian Islands before transiting south, where they undertook the “innocent passage” through U.S. waters between two islands, a defense official said.

That principle allows military ships to transit foreign territorial waters if they don’t conduct threatening activity. The Chinese didn’t give prior notification to the U.S. before doing so, but under international law, they don’t need to.

The Chinese don’t always acknowledge those laws, however, according to U.S. defense reports. For example, Beijing claims that U.S. warships should request permission before making their own “innocent passage” in Chinese territorial waters.

During fiscal years 2012 and 2013, the Pentagon challenged this notion, deploying U.S. naval ships through Chinese territorial waters without notifying Beijing first. According to those reports, the U.S. did not make the same challenge during fiscal 2014. There is no data available for the current fiscal year.

U.S. officials believe China is building a “blue-water” navy capable of operating far from its shores, while also developing missiles and other capabilities designed to prevent the U.S. Navy from intervening in a conflict in Asia.

Many of those capabilities, including a new antiship ballistic missile, were put on display for the first time on Thursday during the parade to mark the surrender of Japanese forces at the end of World War II.

Some U.S. military experts saw the Chinese transit through the Aleutians as a positive step, in that they had adhered to the “innocent passage” principle.

“As a matter of fairness and equity, these operations are a big step forward for U.S. interests in that Beijing now has no basis to object to similar passage through China’s territorial sea by the U.S., for instance in vicinity of China’s islands in the South China Sea,” said Peter Dutton, director of the China Maritime Studies Institute at the U.S. Naval War College.

China took another step in that direction last year during the U.S.-led Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC, joint naval drills in Hawaii.

U.S. officials said then that an uninvited Chinese spy ship had observed the drills from international waters. China’s Defense Ministry said that its operations complied with international law.

Still, Mr. Dutton and other experts said it was doubtful that China would suddenly stop objecting to U.S. naval ships passing through its waters or conducting surveillance nearby.

Pentagon officials said in May they were drawing up plans to send U.S. Navy ships or aircraft within 12 nautical miles of artificial islands that China has been building in the disputed South China Sea.

Later that month, China expressed “strong dissatisfaction” and accused the U.S. of irresponsible and dangerous action after a U.S. Navy surveillance jet flew close to the islands, but not within 12 nautical miles.

China has also repeatedly demanded that the U.S. cease surveillance operations within its exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, which under international law extends 200 nautical miles from the coast.

For that reason, Beijing would likely say its ships off Alaska weren't conducting surveillance, although they probably were, said Taylor Fravel, an expert on China’s military at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

“China faces contradictory impulses to limit the activities of foreign navies within its own EEZ and to operate within the EEZs of others,” he said. “Over time, especially as China’s military becomes even more capable, it could downplay objections to the activities of foreign navies in its EEZ as it seeks to operate more frequently out of the region.”

China’s Defense Ministry didn’t respond to questions about which ships were in the flotilla near Alaska or how close they came to U.S. territory.

The joint exercises with Russia ran from Aug. 20-28 off the Russian Pacific coast—about 2,000 miles west of the Bering Sea—according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Seven Chinese ships took part, including two destroyers, two frigates, two landing ships and one supply ship, Xinhua said.

U.S. officials said the five ships near the Aleutians included three Chinese combat ships, a supply vessel and an amphibious landing ship.

"The U.S. and Canada will resume efforts on Wednesday to resolve issues holding up a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is set to meet U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington after the U.S. and Mexico last week agreed to terms on their portion of the trilateral accord. The focus this week will be on Ottawa and Washington bridging differences to keep all three countries signatories to an update of the quarter-century-old treaty.

President Trump, who has long derided the Nafta treaty as a “disaster,” reiterated over the Labor Day Weekend that if U.S. and Canada fail to reach a deal his administration could move forward on a deal that excludes Canada. He also warned Congress not to interfere.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday his negotiating team is ready to work on a deal that benefits all parties. “There are a number of things that we absolutely must see in a renegotiated Nafta,” he said at a media event in a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia. “No Nafta is better than a bad Nafta deal for Canadians, and that’s what we are going to stay with.”

The White House has formally notified Congress of an intent to sign a new version of Nafta this autumn with Mexico—saying Canada was free to join, “if willing.” The U.S. administration is widely expected to start the process of withdrawing from the old treaty while preparing for congressional ratification of the new one.

It is unclear what the new timetable is for reaching an accord allowing Canada to join. After the two sides failed to reach an agreement last week, people familiar with the process said that new deadline could extend to Sept. 30. That is when, according to U.S. law, the Trump administration would need to make public final text for a trade pact that he could sign by Nov. 30, when Mexico’s leader leaves office.

“We agreed to something we think the Canadians should sign up with, and so we’re very very confident that the talks are going to go well this week and that we’re going to have Canada on board relatively soon,” said Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, on Fox Business Network.

Many U.S. lawmakers, business groups and labor leaders have insisted that Canada remain part of a three-way deal, which allows for duty-free trade that fuels the North American auto industry and other sectors. Mexico has also expressed a preference for Canada to remain, but has signaled willingness to move forward without it.

The stakes are high, as the Trump administration has sought to bring maximum pressure to bear on its closest neighbors, even imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico on national security grounds.

As talks with Canada resume, the biggest sticking point is Canada’s insistence on retaining a dispute-resolution system that allows member states to challenge trade penalties imposed by the others. Mr. Lighthizer has proposed eliminating the system, contained in Nafta’s Chapter 19, and Mexico has agreed to that. But Canada remains unwilling to scrap the mechanism.

“Ensuring everyone plays fair within the Nafta accord is something we can all understand is important,” Mr. Trudeau said. “We need a dispute-resolution mechanism like Chapter 19, and we will hold firm on that.”

Trump administration officials have complained the dispute process erodes U.S. sovereignty, saying the independent panels charged with adjudicating the cases have primarily been used to overturn tariffs imposed by the U.S. Commerce Department on Canadian and Mexican products.

The U.S. and Canada remain far apart on other contentious issues.

Canada has told artistic groups it will fight attempts by U.S. officials to dilute a cultural exemption now in Nafta aimed at protecting the domestic music, television and film sectors. The exemption is meant to ensure Canadian-made productions are broadcast. It is viewed as crucial to the French-speaking province of Quebec—a vote-rich region and a minority in mostly Anglophone North America—and in cities in media centers such as Toronto and Vancouver, which the governing Liberals rely on for support.

“The cultural exemption must stand,” Mr. Trudeau said. “It would be giving up of our sovereignty and our identity.”

Other issues where the U.S. and Canada are at odds include greater U.S. access to the Canadian dairy market; intellectual property; and duty-free treatment of small amounts of goods purchased in the U.S. On top of that, the U.S. and Canada must still address the fate of American tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, which prompted retaliatory tariffs from Ottawa.

“The Canadians don’t compromise easily—these are big political issues in Canada, particularly in dairy,” said William Reinsch, a former U.S. official at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “It’s got to be tempting to give [Mr. Trump] a giant middle finger and just walk away.”

The two countries notched some progress in talks last week, with Nafta chapters dealing with the environment and labor close to completion, said two people familiar with the talks.

Business and labor groups are anxiously following what happens next. The Dairy Farmers of Canada, an industry lobby group, said its members were unwilling to eliminate production quotas and tariffs that aim to thwart foreign competition. The group says the industry is already on course to lose roughly C$250 million in sales due to concessions Canada made on dairy to secure trade deals with the European Union and Pacific-Rim countries.

"WASHINGTON—President Trump is leaning toward Emmet Flood as the next White House counsel, but West Wing officials have urged Mr. Trump not to rush the pick, according to people familiar with the matter.

Mr. Trump told associates over the weekend that he wants Mr. Flood, currently serving as White House special counsel, to succeed Don McGahn, these people said. Mr. McGahn is planning to leave his role as top White House attorney after the Senate acts on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

Mr. Flood wants autonomy to hire his own staff and freedom to restructure the office as he sees fit, according to people familiar with the matter. One person characterized Mr. Flood’s wishes for the office as: “I want to be able to run the show.”

Inside the White House, chief of staff John Kelly is urging Mr. Trump to be deliberative about his final decision for a position that monitors ethical matters throughout the administration, interprets laws for the executive branch and is viewed as the chief legal protector for the office.

Mr. Trump has privately told associates that he wants tough-minded lawyers who are attentive to his interests. But the White House counsel’s job is broader in scope, protecting the interests of the presidency as a whole.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said there were “no announcements at this time.”

White House lawyer Emmet Flood, center, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., earlier this year. Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images

Mr. Flood would bring to the counsel’s office a wealth of experience fending off congressional investigations of the White House, which are expected to escalate if Democrats take control of one or both chambers of Congress this fall.

He was a partner at Williams & Connolly LLP, a top Washington law firm known for its aggressive defense of a range of clients. In the late 1990s, he represented former Democratic President Bill Clinton in impeachment proceedings.

Mr. Flood also served in the White House counsel’s office under President George W. Bush, where he handled congressional investigations that included a review of the Bush administration’s controversial firings of seven U.S. attorneys.

“I strongly favor the selection of Emmet given his skill and experience and the fact that he’s battled investigations from the White House before—because that’s what will be coming,” said Ty Cobb, who preceded Mr. Flood in the job of managing the White House’s response to the Russia investigation.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller is probing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Russia has said it didn’t interfere in the election, and both Mr. Trump and Moscow deny collusion.

One person familiar with the discussions contrasted Mr. Flood’s plans for the office with Mr. McGahn’s view of the job, in which he allowed groups such as the conservative Federalist Society to play a major role in selecting judges to nominate. Mr. Flood, the person said, has suggested he plans to operate more independently.

That independent streak has worried some around Mr. Trump, who believe the top White House attorney should have some partisan credentials. In recent weeks, Trump associates have floated other candidates for the position.

Another person the president has considered for the job is Pat Cipollone, a longtime Washington litigator, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Trump in May appointed Mr. Flood to serve as White House special counsel, succeeding Mr. Cobb after nearly a year in the job. At the time, Mr. Flood was widely expected to succeed Mr. McGahn once he left the job.

Mr. Flood had previously discussed with the White House the possibility of working in the counsel’s office, and Mr. McGahn has been helping groom Mr. Flood to take over, according to people familiar with the matter.

"The House on Tuesday passed a bill that would allow some patients to seek medical treatments still in clinical trials, and this is a welcome end to some messy sausage-making. But it isn’t a GOP license to forget about the more fundamental bureaucratic obstacles to drug approvals.

The House passed 250-169 a bill sponsored by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin that passed the Senate by unanimous consent last year. The bill is named for patients such as Wisconsin mother of three Trickett Wendler, who died in 2015 after a battle with ALS. Another is Jordan McLinn, a young boy in Indiana who has Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

The House over several months made changes to the Senate bill and then passed its own version this spring from House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden. Mr. Johnson then tried to move the House bill in the Senate, but Minority Leader Chuck Schumer blocked it for unexplained reasons.

Foreign Edition Podcast

The question since has been if the bill would die. Mr. Walden deserves credit for finally accepting the Johnson version instead of insisting on his own bill that would fail. The delta between the two versions involved in part who could “try” drugs—did a patient’s diagnosis have to be terminal?—but the differences aren’t worth derailing the project.

The core of the bill is to allow drug manufacturers and patients to enter into mutual agreements without government approval. Many drug companies will decline to provide experimental treatments because they fear this could distract from the goal of FDA approval. But right to try is still important as a message from Congress that patient and physician prerogative are more important than bureaucratic whim.

President Trump is eager to sign the bill, and he kicked off a speech on drug prices this month with some spontaneous lingua franca to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb: “Where is Scott? Stand up, Scott. Stand up. And ‘right to try’ is happening, right? You have that moving? ‘Right to try.’ So important.” Vice President Mike Pence has long been an advocate.

Right to try has moved because Americans perceive that new drugs aren’t reaching patients quickly enough, and they’re right. Discovering a new drug is perhaps the riskiest bet in all of American business. Three phases of clinical trials can last more than six years, and the third part involves as many as 3,000 patients. This model is untenable as discoveries target ever smaller patient populations in the emerging era of biomedicine.

Dr. Gottlieb has been updating FDA processes, but the movement could use more political firepower from Congress. Let’s hope the right-to-try moment is the first of many to help patients receive potentially life-saving treatments as soon as possible.",politics

A woman walks near a row of tents in a refugee settlement in the Lebanese city of Arsal. Some 70,000 Syrians live here, about twice as many as the town’s residents.

ARSAL, Lebanon—As the Assad regime moves to take control of Syria’s last opposition strongholds, the government and its foreign backers are calling on millions of refugees who fled the bloody conflict to come home.

But obstacles the regime is throwing up to their return show that President Bashar al-Assad—mindful of the strain refugees are putting on neighboring countries—is willing to use the exiles as bargaining chips to secure foreign aid and sanctions relief, Western diplomats and analysts in Beirut say.

The Syrian government in recent months has postponed or declined without explanation hundreds of applications from refugees in Lebanon seeking to go back, according to several Western diplomats briefed on the matter.

Samaher Bakor, who fled Syria with her husband and two small children five years ago, standing outside her tent in Arsal. They left for Syria on Monday, after waiting two months for permission to return.

Returnees need identification and family papers, which many left behind during their flight, and approval to travel in Syrian government convoys. Security-clearance procedures are lengthy. Many men have been rejected, so their wives and children stayed back as well, the diplomats said.

As a result, the returns so far are little more than a trickle. Since early June, in Lebanon, where more than a million Syrians live, only about 1,400 of 3,000 Syrians who have applied to return have departed, including about 1,000 this week, according to the Lebanese intelligence agency. The rest are awaiting word from Damascus on their petition to return.

More than five million Syrians have fled since the uprising began in 2011. Most settled in neighboring countries like Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. The Assad regime, which is carrying out an offensive in the country’s southwest backed by Russian airstrikes, officially says refugees should return to rebuild the war-ravaged nation.

“The Syrian government wants to use [the refugees] as a bargaining chip,” said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, an independent Beirut-based think tank. “It wants payment and is monetizing them. Not all of which would necessarily go towards reconstruction.”

The Syrian government didn’t respond to a request to comment. This month, an unnamed Syrian foreign ministry official told the Syrian state news agency SANA that the regime expects the international community to contribute toward resettling them.

Russia has called on the U.S. and the European Union to help rebuild Syria and resettle refugees. Moscow this month invited the U.S. to cooperate on a plan to return refugees to Syria. The proposals, which were submitted after the Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki, included collaboration in funding “the restoration of Syria’s infrastructure,” according to the Russian government.

U.S. officials haven’t publicly commented on whether Washington would support the proposal. Top U.S. military officials have said they aren’t changing the U.S. posture in Syria. In a briefing with reporters Friday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he was “considering” meeting with his Russian counterpart.

European countries insist that before they allocate aid through Damascus, or funds to rebuild Syria, a political transition process must be under way, although they haven’t specified whether that would require Mr. Assad’s ouster.

Still, the Syrian regime is looking to leverage the fact that neighboring and European countries are anxious to see the refugees return. Indeed, Lebanon—where Syrian refugees constitute 20% of the population—has complained about the burden of hosting such large numbers of refugees and has prevented the vast majority of them from settling permanently in the country.

The Lebanese government has criticized the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which provides services for refugees in informal settlements in Lebanon, for instilling fear in the refugees of returning to Syria. The UNHCR says it respects people’s choice to return, but isn’t assisting them in going back.

In Arsal, where refugees number about twice as many as the town’s residents, some 70,000 Syrians live in shabby tarpaulin tents and have few legal rights, including authorization to work. Many speak of harassment and arbitrary arrests by Lebanese authorities. Schooling and health care are poor. Families share toilets that are little more than a hole in the ground.

Samaher Bakor and her husband fled Syria more than five years ago with their two small children and had until recently spent all those years abroad in Arsal. They applied for permission to return to Syria nearly two months ago and sat for days with their meager belongings packed in an old truck as they awaited word. On Monday, they departed for Syria.

“Of course, we are a little scared but my relatives say it’s safe to come back,” Ms. Bakor said before the family left. “In Syria, schools are free, hospitals are free. Here everything requires so much money.”

The refugees who do return face an uncertain fate. Continued fighting in parts of Syria has displaced over 1.2 million Syrians inside the country so far this year, according to UNHCR.

And many fear regime retaliation for having fled the country in the first place. One refugee who departed from Lebanon in June, Hussein Mohammad Audi, was killed shortly after arriving in his hometown of Fleeta. His family said he was shot and dumped at his front door by militias affiliated with the government.

“The regime brands everyone who left Syria a terrorist,” warned Salem Mohammad Rahmoun, another refugee originally from Ras al-Ain in southwest Syria and now living in Arsal.

Ibrahim al Rifai, left, from Ras al Maara, Syria, doesn’t have papers needed to leave the Arsal refugee settlement and return home.

Two other men, aged 50 and 70, were also killed by regime militia fighters after they returned, Arsal residents said.

The Assad government hasn’t commented on the alleged killings.

Still, many Syrian refugees eventually want to go home.

Two weeks ago, Hussein, a Syrian in his 30s, sneaked across Lebanon’s border with Syria into the no man’s land between the two countries to meet his brother for the first time in seven years. As they embraced, “we both cried,” he said.

Although Hussein, who declined to give his full name, fears punishment from the Assad government for fleeing, he soon hopes to return for good.

“I don’t want my son to grow up in this camp to become some thug robbing people with a razorblade,” he said. “Bashar al-Assad can run me over with a tank as long as my son gets to go to school.”

"WASHINGTON—The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday imposed sanctions on Russia’s Agrosoyuz Commercial Bank, saying it handled transactions for North Korea in violation of United Nations bans.

The move advances the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign to press Pyongyang to eliminate its nuclear-weapons program, after a roughly five-month pause in Treasury designations against North Korea and its facilitators. President Trump, amid negotiations with Kim Jong Un’s regime to rid the country of its weapons of mass destruction, said in late May he would hold off implementing new sanctions while talks were continuing.

“I’m not going to put them on until such time as the talks break down,” the president said after a meeting with a top North Korean official. Those negotiations are ongoing, with senior U.S. officials expressing optimism in recent weeks despite evidence Pyongyang is expanding its nuclear and missile assets.

The punitive action—the first time Washington has targeted a Russian bank under its North Korean sanctions policy—also sends a message to Moscow, which the U.S. accuses of not doing enough to stamp out North Korea’s illicit-weapons operations.

“The United States will continue to enforce U.N. and U.S. sanctions and shut down illicit revenue streams to North Korea,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. “Our sanctions will remain in place until we have achieved the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea.”

The Treasury Department said the bank knowingly conducted millions of dollars worth of transactions with a banned North Korean financial agent. Agrosoyuz Commercial Bank opened multiple bank accounts for Han Jang Su, the 48-year-old chief representative of the banned North Korean institution, Foreign Trade Bank, Treasury said. FTB is responsible for handling the country’s foreign currency, a critical hub for North Korea’s financial system.

Mr. Han, who is already blacklisted by the U.S., is one of several dozen North Korean financial agents publicly listed in recent U.N. reports whom member countries are obligated to expel under international sanctions.

Agrosoyuz has a long history with North Korea, Treasury said: Over the past decade, it has handled nearly $20 million in transactions, including almost $2.5 million for a North Korean front company early this year.

The Treasury Department also sanctioned Ri Jong Won, another Moscow-based representative of FTB, saying he held Russian bank accounts in his name until at least 2016. Messrs. Ri and Han couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

Agrosoyuz, which has branches in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Russia’s agricultural hub, Orenburg, is a tiny Russian bank with assets of $180 million. An Agrosoyuz representative declined to comment. Neither Russia’s foreign ministry nor Moscow’s embassy in Washington immediately responded to requests for comment.

The administration has come close to imposing these sanctions numerous times in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter, but always opted to hold off as directives from Mr. Trump urged against any actions that might derail his delicate talks with the North Koreans.

But in recent months, the U.S. and U.N. officials have disclosed mounting evidence of widespread North Korean sanctions evasion in Russia, including the use of Russian ports for illicit oil shipments. Friday’s action comes a day after The Wall Street Journal reported Russia is allowing thousands of North Korean laborers into the country in what U.S. officials say may be violations of other U.N. sanctions.

“Credible reports of Russia violating U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korean laborers working abroad are deeply troubling,” said Nikki Haley, the U.S. envoy to the U.N. “Until we see the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea there can be no easing of sanctions,” she said. “Talk is cheap—Russia cannot support sanctions with their words in the Security Council only to violate them with their actions.”

Early Friday, Mr. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, gave the go-ahead that the sanctions were to finally be rolled out.

Under U.N. Security Council resolutions that Russia, as a member of the council, agreed to implement, Moscow should have expelled Mr. Han early last year when the U.S. identified him as a North Korean financial agent, the Treasury Department said. But U.S. and U.N. officials complain that the Kremlin is allowing Mr. Han and other North Korean financial agents to continue to operate in the country.

It is a strategy that U.S. officials say is intentionally designed to undermine Washington’s policy on North Korea and fuel tensions between the two powers that are already at Cold War levels.

Treasury’s sanctions leverage the heft of the world’s most important financial market and currency. Access to U.S. dollars and lending is critical to the global economy with most of the world’s trade transacted in the greenback and the global financial system wired into its banks and credit institutions.

“No U.S. bank will willingly do any transactions that involve the Agrosoyuz, whether directly or indirectly,” said Carlton Greene, a senior veteran of Treasury’s sanctions shop, now a partner at Crowell & Moring in its international trade and white-collar practices.

Agrosoyuz can’t tap U.S. markets for cash, even through intermediaries, because other banks will shy away from interacting with a blacklisted bank for fear of losing their own access to U.S. markets if the U.S. Treasury Department finds out. That not only complicates the bank’s ability to raise funds, but also its clients could find it very difficult to pay foreign customers, suppliers or investors.

"Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team will take President Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort to court in Alexandria, Va., on Tuesday, in a trial with implications reaching far beyond the immediate charges ranging from tax evasion to bank fraud.

The outcome of the trial, which is expected to last three weeks, will help determine how the public perceives Mr. Mueller’s 14-month-long investigation into interference in the 2016 election. A conviction would provide the special prosecutor with momentum as he pushes to complete the investigation amid criticism from some Republicans that he is leading a partisan inquiry. An acquittal would give Mr. Mueller’s critics ammunition to push for a quick end to the special counsel’s operation.

Much is at stake for the president as well, since he has repeatedly dismissed the Russia probe as a “witch hunt.” A successful jury trial could blunt such characterizations.

While Mr. Mueller’s investigation has resulted in charges against 25 Russians and four former advisers to Mr. Trump, the case against Mr. Manafort will delve into his personal finances largely before his work on the campaign.

Mr. Manafort also faces a second, related criminal trial in Washington, D.C., after this one, and could face pressure to cooperate with Mr. Mueller, depending on the outcome of the first trial.

Mr. Manafort has pleaded not guilty and denies all of the charges, which include tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to file reports on foreign bank accounts.

Mr. Manafort has argued that he talked to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about many of the allegations in 2014, and believed prosecutors weren’t interested in pursuing the case at the time.

Prosecutors have accused Mr. Manafort of not paying taxes on $30 million in income from his work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine in the early 2010s. Mr. Manafort is also accused of misleading banks to obtain millions in loans in 2015 and 2016 as his Ukraine income dried up.

A spokesman for Mr. Manafort declined to comment.

Mr. Manafort, who has been in prison since mid-June after prosecutors accused him of trying to influence witness testimony, appeared briefly in court last week in a green prison jumpsuit, blowing a kiss to his wife, who sat behind him.

In its list of exhibits, Mr. Mueller’s team has identified 436 pieces of evidence they plan to introduce, including the defendant’s emails, his company’s financial statements, bank records and photos of purchases he allegedly made with the income at issue.

Prosecutors have said they plan to show the jury dozens of documents related to the purchases, including a $160,000 invoice of two silk rugs from 2010; documents from the Manafort family’s 2012 purchases of a $2.8 million Manhattan apartment and a $1.9 million home in Arlington, Va.; and records from $503,500 in landscaping services at Mr. Manafort’s Long Island home.

Prosecutor Greg Andres said last week that his team wouldn’t mention during trial the question of whether Trump associates colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. But they would need to briefly address Mr. Manafort’s role with the Trump campaign, Mr. Andres told the judge, because it is relevant to one of the alleged bank fraud schemes.

Moscow has denied election interference.

That is because the chairman of a bank that provided Mr. Manafort with $16 million in loans—even though Mr. Manafort had submitted falsified documents—extended the loan because he sought, though he didn’t obtain, a position with the Trump administration, Mr. Andres said.

The Wall Street Journal has previously identified that individual as Steve Calk at Federal Savings Bank in Chicago. Mr. Calk didn’t respond to a message seeking comment.

Mr. Manafort has asked the court to limit prosecutors’ use of dozens of emails and other documents from Mr. Manafort’s consulting work with former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his political party. Mr. Manafort’s legal team argued they weren’t relevant to the tax and bank fraud charges, and would risk prejudicing and confusing the jury.

U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis hasn’t yet ruled on that request. But he said he would work to limit the trial to the facts at issue and not delve into what he termed as “theater,” in what is expected to be one of the most closely watched criminal trials of the year.

“I’m not going to allow this trial to drag on,” Judge Ellis said. He later told prospective jurors he expected the trial to last a total of three weeks.

Mr. Manafort joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 and had departed by August.

His longtime business deputy, Richard Gates, pleaded guilty earlier this year to charges related to the Ukraine work and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller. Mr. Gates is expected to testify against Mr. Manafort in what could be one of the more consequential moments of the trial.

Mr. Manafort’s defense strategy is likely to revolve around pinning the blame on Mr. Gates and the accountants and attorneys who advised him, legal experts said. He faces more than a decade in prison if convicted.

When jury selection begins this week, Judge Ellis said he wouldn’t allow either side to ask potential jurors whom they voted for.

What happens in Syria rarely stays there, as Barack Obama learned the hard way and Donald Trump is now discovering. Bashar Assad’s forces and his Iranian and Russian allies are preparing an assault on Idlib province, the last major opposition redoubt, and the attack is putting Mr. Trump’s lack of a Syria strategy in sharp relief.

The White House issued a statement Tuesday warning against “a reckless escalation of an already tragic conflict.” The press secretary also warned against another use of chemical weapons, while the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, worried about a “humanitarian catastrophe” in Idlib. “We don’t see any way that significant military operations are going to be beneficial to the people of Syria,” Gen. Dunford said.

This is all well meaning, but it’s the kind of diplomatic pleading that John Kerry and Mr. Obama were famous for in Syria, and we know how that worked. Amid these U.S. entreaties, Russia began air strikes around Idlib on Tuesday and a Kremlin spokesman promised to finish the job “unconditionally.”

Mr. Trump has dined out politically on his two air strikes responding to Mr. Assad’s use of chemical weapons, but those pinprick attacks didn’t change the underlying reality in the conflict: Mr. Assad, Russia and Iran are on their way to controlling Syria in the post-civil war, post-Islamic State era. This axis of opportunism allowed the U.S. and Kurds to roll up ISIS in Syria’s northeast while the axis focused on wiping out opposition strongholds.

Mr. Trump’s impulse has been to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria once its stronghold in Raqqa was liberated, but he is slowly figuring out that this has damaging strategic consequences for U.S. interests.

One problem is that it lets Iran turn Syria into another forward operating base on Israel’s border. National Security Adviser John Bolton has been demanding that Iran leave Syria, and seeking Russia’s help in the effort. But Iran and Russia respond to power, not pleading, and they’ve heard Mr. Trump announce many times that he wants out of Syria.

Meanwhile, Turkey, Russia and Iran are meeting later this week in Tehran to decide on their next steps in Syria. The Turks want a buffer zone in the north from refugees, as well as some assurance that Kurdish separatists won’t be allowed to operate from Syria. Russia wants to be seen as having assured the victory of its client, Mr. Assad, while retaining air and naval bases. Iran wants to be Mr. Assad’s puppet-master.

Mr. Obama left Mr. Trump with a mess in Syria, but in 20 months the President has done little to alter the balance of forces. Mr. Trump seems content to issue tweets about Idlib, but Mr. Assad and his allies won’t stop there. Their next target will be the Kurds and Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), America’s main ground partners, who are working with U.S. special forces in Syria east of the Euphrates River.

The danger is that the Kurds and SDF will begin to negotiate a cease-fire to save themselves from becoming the next Idlib. Then U.S. forces would be isolated in Syria and a withdrawal would be inevitable. Iran will own the place, despite Mr. Trump’s speeches about containing its regional aggression.

"The new National Pension Service headquarters is a three-hour drive from Seoul.

JEONBUK INNOCITY, South Korea—Wanted: Chief investment officer to oversee more than half a trillion dollars in assets. Must be willing to weather intense political criticism for below-market pay. Openness to sharing a dormitory with roommates is a plus. Tolerance for the smell of pigs and livestock manure essential.

South Korea is struggling to fill a top opening at its National Pension Service—the world’s third-largest pension fund—and it isn’t hard to see why.

Welcome to the neighborhood.

The job can be intensely political. As a major shareholder in many of South Korea’s biggest public companies, the government-run pension service often casts the deciding vote in corporate decisions.

The position—which oversees $565 billion in assets, more than the annual gross domestic product of Belgium—pays roughly a third of a comparable private-sector job.

What really stinks about the job, though, is the location. Last year, the NPS moved out of the bustling capital of Seoul to a government-backed “innovative city” about 120 miles south, surrounded by mountains, rice paddies and livestock and manure-handling facilities. With a population of 26,500, Jeonbuk Innocity is home to 12 public agencies and clusters of newly constructed apartment buildings within its 3.8-square-mile turf.

Many employees hunker down during the workweek in shared apartments provided by the government and go back to Seoul on the weekends. “It’s exactly like a college dorm,” said one employee, who gets up early every morning to scout out opportunities online for jobs elsewhere. “It’s getting quite isolated.”

The new NPS headquarters, housed in a futuristic glass-walled building, sits near the country’s Rural Development Administration and the National Institute of Animal Science. The institute succeeded last month in creating the world’s first genetic map of a black ogye chicken, a species native to the region.

The region’s pigsties and manure-reclamation facilities have led to more than 155 smell complaints in Jeonbuk Innocity this year, according to a provincial official. In March, the regional government installed “automatic microorganism sprays” in manure-handling locations near the town in an attempt to alleviate the odorous assault.

In a speech last year, Kim Sung-joo, the NPS chairman who engineered the pension fund’s move five years ago as a lawmaker, compared the rustic surroundings to the investment empire that Warren Buffett has built in Omaha, Neb. (Population: 447,000.)

If Mr. Buffett could do it, Mr. Kim argued, there’s no reason why the NPS couldn’t flourish in its new abode.

During the move south, the pension service lost more than a quarter of its money-management staff. Thirty of its posts—including chief investment officer and three of eight other senior roles—have remained vacant for months.

“I couldn’t bear my life” at the new innocity, said one former employee who left immediately after the relocation.

The NPS declined to comment.

On Fridays, employees fill up buses lined up outside the pension fund’s building. The buses shuttle them about three hours away back to Seoul, where many of their families opted to remain.

“Starting Friday evening, there’s no one out on the streets,” said Lim Jin-hee, who runs a rice-soup restaurant near the headquarters. She had hoped the NPS relocation would help her business.

Some senior-level employees have reacquainted themselves with simple tasks they haven’t had to do in years. With his family staying in Seoul, one executive taught himself to fix a simple breakfast of microwavable rice, fried eggs, kimchi and Spam. He has since left the fund.

“At first there was some curiosity to the new lifestyle, but after a few months everyone was getting fatigued,” he said.

The prolonged vacancies haven’t gone unnoticed in South Korea’s legislature, where one irate lawmaker recently wondered why it was so hard to find a suitable chief investment officer in a highly educated country of roughly 50 million people.

“Do we have to import somebody?” Kim Myung-yeon, a National Assembly member for the opposition party, asked NPS’s chief executive officer at a recent meeting.

Almost 7,000 miles away, many New York hedge funds have willingly relocated to bucolic Connecticut in recent years, lured by lower taxes and good schools, all less than an hour by train from Manhattan.

Jeonbuk Innocity isn’t exactly Greenwich, Conn. It is one of 10 planned cities across South Korea, built from scratch by the government to serve as homes for public institutions. The plan is part of a broader government campaign to spread South Korea’s economic development, overwhelmingly concentrated in Seoul, to relatively neglected corners of the country.

Last week, the head of South Korea’s ruling party called for another 122 public entities, including financial institutions, to relocate to rural areas.

Private-equity and hedge-fund managers visiting South Korea used to make the NPS their first stop. Now, more of them are deciding to bypass the NPS altogether, reckoning that a trip to Japan is a better use of their time.

The nearest city to Jeonbuk Innocity, Jeonju, is a 30-minute drive away. It is best known for its traditional Korean houses and its bibimbap, the country’s famous mixed-rice dish.

The area “is not an investment hub,” said Jayne Bok, the Hong Kong-based head of investments for Asia at Willis Towers Watson , a risk-management and advisory company.

After earning 7.3% in 2017, NPS’s portfolio logged 0.9% in gains in the first half of 2018.

It’s hard to tie the move to the fund’s performance, but Kim Hoon-gil, a senior analyst at Hana Financial Investment Co. Ltd. in Seoul, isn’t optimistic about the impact of the relocation. “If I had to venture a guess, I’d say it’s not good,” he said.

But American soldiers are still here, running laps past the small Sept. 11 memorial, playing soccer in the 90-degree summer-evening heat, and checking out the hip-hop dance night at the USO Ice House.

The Boardwalk has always served as an apt metaphor for the state of the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan, and in important ways still does.

At the height of President Obama’s military surge in 2011, it was a surreal oasis for 30,000 people working to beat back Taliban advances.

Now, it is pretty quiet. About 3,500 American forces work on the sprawling desert base, where they fly Reaper drones and Warthog warplanes, train Afghan helicopter pilots, and keep trying to execute an exit strategy that sticks.

In Kandahar and around the country, the U.S. is still battling corruption, still trying to build a reliable Afghan military, still trying to prevent ethnic divisions from triggering another civil war, still worrying about Afghan soldiers turning their guns on their American partners, still badgering Pakistan to crack down on Taliban havens across the border, still trying to turn poppy farmers into pomegranate growers.

The U.S. has been trying to promote pomegranates as a path to peace for more than a decade. In 2008, the Economist labeled the fruit “Afghanistan’s great purple hope.” In 2010, the U.S. pumped millions of dollars into programs meant to encourage farmers growing opium poppies to grow things like pomegranates. In 2012, a Taliban suicide bomber destroyed one of Kandahar’s fledgling pomegranate-juice factories.

In July, Jamie Knapp, a retired Marine Corps colonel who has spent the past six years working as a specially trained “Afghan Hand”—military men and women specially trained on the language, culture and politics of the region—hailed a new brand of Kandahar-produced pomegranate juice as a sign that things have changed.

“I can tell you what the solution is—it’s not a mystery,” Mr. Knapp said after handing out small bottles of juice to visitors. “It’s a four-letter-word: J-O-B-S. Offer these people a form of income and they will reject whatever message the Taliban can offer.”

Mr. Knapp knows Afghanistan better than most. Since 2012, he has helped teach Afghan soldiers English, worked in the presidential palace as an adviser to President Ashraf Ghani, and now advises Afghan officials in Kandahar.

“I think many people may be growing tired, thinking, ‘When will this thing in Afghanistan end?’ ” he said. “We are so close with what we are doing. If we can walk with them into the future, then I think we will have a friend in every Afghan that we ever thought we could, and we will have something to look back to the American people and say: ‘I know it was hard, and a lot of blood and treasure was invested, but we did it.’ ”

The most important person who needs convincing is the one in the Oval Office. President Trump reluctantly embraced his national-security team’s advice on Afghanistan. He sent about 6,000 more U.S. forces to Afghanistan with an open-ended pledge to train Afghan security forces until they can protect their country and force the Taliban into peace talks.

But Mr. Trump has little appetite for spending billions of dollars in Afghanistan, and America’s military leaders know they could wake up one day to a presidential tweet that upends their plans.

While American airmen take another shot at trying to create an air force for Afghanistan, U.S. pilots based in Kandahar are doing the job.

“We joke that we’re trying to put the wings on in the air as we’re flying down the runway, and there’s probably some truth to that,” said Lt. Col. Marcus Jackson, an Air Force officer working to build and train Afghan pilots to fly a small fleet of Black Hawk helicopters.

For some Americans at Kandahar, this is their second, third or fourth time in Afghanistan. This time, they say, it really is different.

“For it to be ‘Groundhog Day,’ it would have to be the same,” said Maj. Rene DelaFuente, an Air Force officer working with Col. Jackson.

The Afghan forces, they say, can do things now that they couldn’t do a few years ago: For the first time, the Afghan military is using its own planes to drop laser-guided missiles in battle.

Out on the Kandahar flight line, right next to the hangars for America’s Reaper drones, a concrete bunker is spray painted with simple black graffiti: “Kill ‘Em All!!”

“Who knows how long that’s been there,” said Maj. Richard Barker, a U.S. Army spokesman at the base.

The provocative graffiti has probably been there for years. But, in all that time, no one has ever taken a few minutes to paint it over to reassure Afghans working on the base that, this time, it is really different.

"Swedes headed to the polls Sunday in an election in which an anti-immigration party rooted in neo-Nazism is threatening to upend the political order in one of Europe’s most traditionally liberal nations.

Following a polarizing campaign dominated by the issues of immigration and crime, the nationalist Sweden Democrats are poised to win between 17% and 24% of the vote, according to opinion polls, up from 12.9% in 2014.

Any score above 20% could make it impossible for center-left or center-right parties to form a stable coalition.

After populist successes in Italy, Hungary and Austria in recent months, such an outcome would be the latest example of how the refugee crisis of 2015 is continuing to redraw political landscapes even in the continent’s most stable democracies.

While they have long disavowed their far-right roots, the Sweden Democrats have campaigned for a de-facto ban on accepting new asylum seekers and the faster deportation of illegal immigrants.

All of Sweden’s other parties have vowed not to govern with them, although some center-right politicians have discussed the possibility of entering a minority government supported by the populist party.

Exit polls are set to be released soon after the vote ends at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with official results expected around midnight.

Håkan Spännar, a 54 year old chiropractor, voted for the Sweden Democrats Sunday and highlighted crime, safety, and social welfare as his biggest areas of concern. He previously voted for the Moderates but said he decided to switch allegiance this time, in part to make the big parties wake up.

“Every party, they are just talking, and I think [Sweden Democrat leader] Jimmie Akesson is telling some truth. They are not perfect either, but I am not behind racism of any kind.”

Mr. Spännar is expecting big success for the Sweden Democrats, saying he wouldn’t be surprised if they are the biggest party. “Many people are a little afraid of telling people who they’re voting for, but I think people might be a little bit more brave and stand up for some things they believe in.”

The latest opinion polls suggest Prime Minister Stefan Löfven’s center-left Social Democrats, traditionally the dominant party in Sweden, could suffer their worst showing in history. The center-right Moderate party is vying for second place with the Sweden Democrats.

Charlie Weimers, 35, a former official of the moderate conservative Christian Democrats, left his party Thursday to join the Sweden Democrats, in what was perhaps the most high-profile defection ahead of the election.

“My old party did not view the issues of immigration and integration with the necessary sense of urgency,” he said. “Immigration is of course related to the volume of immigration: Swedish society is no longer able to integrate the amount of people who have come already.”

Both centrist parties, which have alternated in power at the helm of their respective center-right and center-left alliances, adopted some of the Sweden Democrats’ antimigrant rhetoric after the 2015 spike in asylum seekers sparked a popular backlash.

The country took in more than 160,000 people during 2015, even more per inhabitant than Germany, the migrants’ main destination upon entering Europe. Shortly after the influx peaked in the summer, Mr. Löfven closed the border and hardened asylum rules.

With the Sweden Democrats closing in, Ulf Kristersson, leader of the center-right bloc, last week called the country’s decadeslong liberal approach to immigration “very unsuccessful.”

For over a decade, Sweden welcomed more asylum seekers per capita than the U.S. Yet while such openness enjoyed broad acceptance among the main political parties, it was never backed by a majority of the population, said Patrik Ohberg, a political scientist at Gothenburg University.

“Publicly discussing mass immigration and crime was considered evil, but now there is a rude awakening and mainstream politicians are forced to admit they were wrong, and the far-right was right—and this helps the Sweden Democrats,” Mr. Ohberg said.

Certain types of crime such as gun homicide and rape have been rising, mainly in small immigrant-populated areas. But linking crime to mass migration was long a taboo in the public debate.

This changed recently, as more statistics drew a close correlation between immigration and crime, adding fuel to the electoral campaign.

Last week, public broadcaster SVT published court data showing that 58% of convicted rapists in the 2012-17 period were foreigners.

Sweden’s economy has been performing passably, but economists warn it faces headwinds—including a weakening currency, record levels of private debt and a per-capita economic growth rate that has become one of the slowest in the European Union.

In this context, an ambiguous election result with no clear majority resulting in a fragile government or protracted coalition negotiations might unsettle markets and exacerbate those problems.

Mattias Karlsson, parliamentary leader for the Sweden Democrats, said despite rival parties’ backtracking on immigration, voters remained disillusioned.

“Confidence in government is very low at the moment but confidence in our policies has increased because we have kept the same position,” Mr. Karlsson said.

He said his party would back a minority government that pledged to implement the populist party’s immigration platform.

“If nearly a quarter of the people vote for us, the other parties can’t keep ignoring our policies. They will have to adopt them,” Mr. Karlsson said.

"Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh wrapped up what is likely to be the toughest part of his confirmation process Thursday, completing two 13-hour days of public questioning in which senators often spent their time sparring with one another.

Senators battled each other over confidential documents, with Democrats threatening civil disobedience and Republican warning of severe consequences, and Judge Kavanaugh for a time becoming a spectator at his own confirmation. That followed a Wednesday session in which Democrats repeatedly tried to force a vote on adjourning the hearing.

When senators did press Judge Kavanaugh, they often were rebuffed. They invited him to criticize President Trump’s attacks on judges, prosecutors and the press, but he spent his final day before the Senate Judiciary Committee deflecting those efforts as well as attempts to draw out his views on abortion rights, campaign finance regulations and same-sex marriage.

With the Republicans’ 51-49 Senate majority likely to ensure Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation before the Supreme Court reconvenes next month, Democrats aimed to tie him to the embattled president they painted as a threat to American democracy.

"The leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea reopened shared border crossings on Tuesday, restoring direct road transport for the first time in two decades and capping months of whirlwind diplomacy that has thawed a frozen conflict.

Ethiopia’s reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and longtime Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki gathered with soldiers and marching bands to open the frontier at Bure, a front line that saw some of the fiercest fighting during the 1998-2000 war that left tens of thousands of people dead. The move, timed for the celebration of the Ethiopian new year, opened the border post “for road transport connectivity,” Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Meskel said on Twitter .

The formal opening of the frontier paves the way for cross-border trade between the erstwhile enemies after their unexpected reconciliation since Mr. Ahmed took office in April. The leaders said troops would be withdrawn from the border—one of the world’s most heavily mined frontiers, according to the United Nations—to ease tensions.

The peace deal is set to recalibrate trade and geopolitics in a strategic but volatile region perched next to the Middle East and along the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping routes for goods and oil from Asia to Europe via the Suez Canal.

For Ethiopia—a rising regional power and strong U.S. security ally with a population of 100 million and one of the world’s fastest-growing economies—the deal will help redirect military spending toward development and gain access to the sea. The reconciliation could help bring Eritrea—a country so isolated it is often referred to as Africa’s North Korea—in from the cold and invigorate a moribund economy reliant on conscription and national service.

Ahmed Salim, a strategist from the political risk consultancy Teneo Intelligence, said the border opening suggested the peace efforts were real and would be difficult to reverse. “The border opening marks an important milestone for the Horn of Africa. … These developments are positive for Ethiopia’s economy, particularly as the country’s access to a variety of ports have increased almost overnight,” he said.

The peace process is already reverberating beyond the affected nations.

After years supporting opposing sides in Somalia’s civil war, Ethiopia and Eritrea last week signed a cooperation agreement with Mogadishu to restore peace and stability to the region.

The geopolitical shift has also spawned a series of moving stories of reconciliation as friends, neighbors and family members are reunited after more than two decades of separation. Families divided by the conflict will now be able to go and visit each other by crossing the border.

Sana Bununis, a resident of Bure, was emotional as he told state-owned Ethiopia television that he hopes to finally visit his relatives on the Eritrean side of the border after years of separation.

“This is a day we have all longed for,” Mr. Bununis said, cradling an Ethiopian flag on a dusty, potholed road. “We are very happy.”

The war was triggered by disputes over the location of the 620-mile borderline. Tensions persisted following the cessation of active hostilities after Ethiopia rejected a U.N. ruling and refused to cede border regions to Eritrea.

But Mr. Ahmed, a 42-year-old former army officer who emerged as prime minister from an opaque power struggle in the ruling party, has made the rapprochement a central part of his reform blitz.

In July, he invited Eritrea’s president to sign a declaration saying that the state of war between the two countries was over. Since then, phone calls and flights between the two countries have resumed and embassies have reopened in each others’ capitals.

Pollsters say the peace deal is popular with Ethiopian voters and could give Mr. Ahmed protection as he tackles the more divisive issue of liberalizing Ethiopia’s economy and partly privatizing state-owned enterprises, including Ethiopian Airlines, one of the world’s fastest-growing carriers. Market analysts expect him to tighten commercial and investment relations with the West over China, which has so far dominated the Ethiopian economy and owns most of the country’s massive debt load. Some analysts warn that the radical approach risks upsetting some hard-liners in the system.

Footage on Tuesday morning from Ethiopia’s national television showed crowds lining a dusty road next to the Bure border crossing and waving the flags of Eritrea and Ethiopia.

“Mr. Ahmed has continued to impress as he shakes up the Ethiopian system,” said Jared Jeffery, an analyst with NKC African Economics. “The prime minister is taking on entrenched interests and making powerful enemies.”

"MADRID—Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered in Barcelona on Tuesday in a quest to restore momentum to their bid to secede from Spain, a sign of the intractable political clash that confronts the recently appointed Spanish prime minister.

Demonstrators stretched along several miles of Barcelona’s main avenue shouted “independence!” in a show of strength to mark an annual event celebrating the culture and history of Spain’s Catalonia region. They were also a multitudinous reminder for Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez that many Catalans haven’t abandoned their goal of eventual independence, despite a failed attempt to secede from the rest of Spain last autumn.

Joaquim “Quim” Torra, the regional president and a hard-line separatist, said the regional government will honor the results of an unauthorized independence referendum held last year, when a majority of Catalans who cast their ballots voted in favor of secession. Millions of other Catalans boycotted the illegal vote. “Our government has committed to make the republic a reality,” Mr. Torra said in a televised address in Barcelona.

Mr. Torra hasn’t provided details on how to overcome the Spanish central government’s steadfast opposition to make Catalonia an independent republic. Instead, he’s called on pro-independence supporters to fill the streets to mark the coming anniversaries of the Oct. 1 illegal referendum and the subsequent independence declaration. Madrid responded to last autumn’s declaration by ousting Mr. Torra’s predecessor and other Catalan leaders and seizing temporary control of the region.

Since the center-left Mr. Sánchez became prime minister in June, he has tried to reduce tensions with Catalan separatist leaders. The premier has met with Mr. Torra, pledging more dialogue and floating the possibility that Catalans could vote on more autonomy within Spain.

Catalonia, an engine of Spain’s economy and home to 7.5 million people, already controls its own police force and oversees its schools and health care system.

Despite the shift in tone by Mr. Sánchez, the standoff between Spain and its most restless region continues. Mr. Sánchez insists he will not authorize a referendum on Catalan independence and has signaled that national authorities would respond to any unauthorized referendum by again seizing temporary control of the regional government.

“What are the pillars of the Spanish government’s policy toward Catalonia? [Upholding the] law and dialogue,” Mr. Sánchez told lawmakers on Tuesday in Madrid.

A majority of Spaniards agrees with Mr. Sánchez’s firm stance against secession. Only one in 10 Spaniards support granting Catalonia and Spain’s 16 regions the possibility to become independent, according to a survey in July by Spain’s Center for Sociological Research, a figure that has held steady in recent years.

In Catalonia, voters are much more divided. Forty percent of Catalans want Catalonia to be an independent country, according to a poll conducted in June and July by the region’s survey agency. About one-quarter of those surveyed support Catalonia’s current status as an autonomous region, while 22% want more autonomy within a more decentralized Spain, which would make Catalonia somewhat akin to a U.S. state.

Some separatist leaders, who think they still lack enough popular support for full independence, are aiming to build majority support for secession over time. Mr. Torra and other hard-liners, however, want to raise the pressure on Madrid to grant an independence referendum as soon as possible.

Faced with such divisions, separatists have focused more in recent months on what unites them: Their anger at the jail time their nine fellow separatist leaders are serving while they await trial. Spanish prosecutors have charged the ringleaders of last autumn’s unauthorized referendum and subsequent declaration of independence with rebellion against the Spanish state. Their trial is expected later this year. Other separatists, including former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, fled Spain for other European countries to avoid arrest in what they say is a politicized justice system.

Separatists have called on Mr. Sánchez to release their colleagues but the prime minister has insisted he has no control over the trial. Separatists have been papering Catalonia’s fences, benches, traffic posts and bridges with yellow ribbons to show support for jailed and exiled colleagues.

The yellow ribbons are controversial with many Catalans who want to stay part of Spain. Some Catalan opponents of secession have been snipping the ribbons away, triggering arguments in the streets.

A Nicaraguan university student stood guard this week at one of the entrances to the National Autonomous University in Managua, holding a makeshift launcher used to discharge firecrackers.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua—The children and grandchildren of Nicaraguan revolutionaries who fought alongside Daniel Ortega to topple a dictatorship four decades ago are now leading a movement to oust him from power.

The nation’s largest public university, once a stronghold of Mr. Ortega’s leftist Sandinista revolution, has become a command bunker for a student-led revolt. The government is loath to dislodge the several hundred student rebels holed up at National Autonomous University, where dozens of barricades made of paving-stone and sheet iron control access.

More violence could further inflame a conflict during which police and paramilitary groups have killed at least 120 people in the past seven weeks. A student leader said that includes four people at the university.

A university student leader known by the pseudonym Tigrillo showed a gunshot wound he said he received during the university takeover.

“Ortega is a murderer and he has to go now,” said a 21-year old engineering student wearing olive-green fatigues who calls herself Comandante Tortuga (Commander Turtle), a moniker in the Sandinista tradition. “The awakening of the Nicaraguan people has no turning back.”

This granddaughter of a revolutionary fighter commanded a hilltop campsite surrounded by sandbag trenches overlooking the now-closed campus. A friend who calls himself RoboCop wields a small homemade mortar.

What began as a protest against tax increases to fund Nicaragua’s cash-strapped pension system morphed into a nationwide movement that aims to force Mr. Ortega’s ouster.

Nicaragua’s government says that the protests are a plot to overthrow a democratically elected government.

The rebellion caught most Nicaraguans by surprise. Just two years ago, Mr. Ortega won his third consecutive term as president by a landslide. During his 11 years in power, he has worked closely with the country’s private sector to deliver economic growth. He has kept Nicaragua largely free of the toxic levels of violence that afflict the region.

Bottles that students used to make Molotov cocktails.

But the progress has come at a high price. Mr. Ortega has largely dismantled the country’s fragile democratic institutions. He controls the country’s congress, its Supreme Court and judiciary as well as its electoral agencies and most of the media.

The rebellion is also fueled by the deep unpopularity of his eccentric wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo. Beyond giving the national weather report and news on a daily noon TV broadcast, critics say she effectively runs the country.

Ms. Murillo has also alienated many of Mr. Ortega’s old Sandinista comrades-in-arms. The reclusive Mr. Ortega has scarcely appeared in public since the disturbances began.

“The one who did the revolution betrayed the revolution,” said a student whose nom de guerre is Erasmo, who said he’s the son of a Sandinista fighter.

Nicaraguans have grown tired of corruption allegations surrounding the ruling couple. They resent the Ortegas’ authoritarianism and say the ruling couple have come to resemble the Somoza family dynasty, which ruled Nicaragua for decades. Students say the protests are an angry demand for freedom and democracy.

A rebel student leader who goes by the pseudonym Comandante Tortuga stood guard this week on a university hilltop.

“The students are playing a key role. For the first time since he took power, Ortega has lost the streets,” said Humberto Belli, a former education minister.

The big question now is whether Mr. Ortega, 72, will be able to stay in power. He has said he is unwilling to leave office before his five-year term ends in 2021.

After meeting with Nicaraguan bishops on Thursday following a breakdown in talks between the government, its opponents and the private sector, Mr. Ortega said he would study their proposals to “democratize” the country.

Mr. Ortega’s opponents are demanding that he pass electoral and constitutional changes to level the political playing field and guarantee free, early elections.

“After the terrible repression of recent days, he lost what little legitimacy he had left. We won’t accept anything that doesn’t mean his immediate resignation,” said Edwin Carcache, a student leader.

A protestor who goes by Robocop held a makeshift firecracker launcher.

Nicaragua’s economy is starting to feel the impact. Funides, a prestigious local think tank, slashed its growth outlook for the country to 1.7% from the 4.7% growth projection before the protests began. If political instability continues throughout the year, Funides sees the economy shrinking 2%, in what would be the country’s first recession since 2009.

“The country is heading towards an economic paralysis,” said Mario Arana, a member of Funides and a former central bank chief.

At the university, protesting students share meals—rice with peas and chicken—while a radio mostly plays heavy metal and techno. Most of them sleep here because of fear that they could be kidnapped by police or paramilitary gangs if they return home.

Gunmen have wounded several students during nighttime attacks. Tigrillo, or Little Tiger, a 22-year-old engineering student, was wounded last month when a bullet grazed his left temple.

“We won’t give up. Who will win in the end, a corrupt dictator or millions of Nicaraguans? The answer is obvious to me,” he says.

Outside the university, a “Tree of Life”—one of 140 metal structures that light up at night across Managua and constructed under the orders of Ms. Murillo—lies on the ground after being knocked down. In its place, a blue-and-white Nicaraguan flag flutters in the wind.

A student rebel who calls herself Syria stood at the barricade she is in charge of inside the National Autonomous University. On the ground are the words Daniel Genocide, in reference to President Ortega.

"MILAN— Starbucks Corp. SBUX -0.27% opens a coffee shop on average every four hours somewhere in the world. But this store is different. It is the first one for Italy.

On Friday, the Seattle-based chain started selling its American take on coffee in the home of espresso. After amassing more than 25,000 coffee shops in 78 countries, Starbucks has coming to Milan with a “reserve roastery” in a converted post office on a central square near the city’s famous Gothic cathedral.

It is only Starbucks’s third roastery after Seattle and Shanghai. In a sign of the expected difficulty in winning over tradition-obsessed Italians, there will be no Frappuccinos or other blended drinks on offer. It will be as much about theater as coffee. Customers can speak to a Starbucks employee manning a large custom-built roaster in the middle of the cafe, sip alcoholic drinks in the evening in a nod to Milan’s traditional aperitivo, and eat pizza and pastries made in a wood-fired brick oven by noted Milanese baker Princi.

“It’s a reflection of the fact that we come here with great respect for the Italian coffee experience,” Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said in an interview.

It is that experience that inspired Howard Schultz, who after a visit to Milan 35 years ago began the transformation that would turn Starbucks into the behemoth it is today.

Starbucks has been focusing on expanding abroad, especially in China, to offset stagnant sales in the U.S., where Starbucks is closing stores.

The Milan Starbucks is opening during a moment of ferment for the coffee industry. Coca-Cola Co. last week announced it would buy British coffee-shop chain Costa for $5.1 billion while Nestlé SA this year bought the rights to sell Starbucks products in retail stores.

Milanese coffee drinkers will have to wait a little to get their first local Caramel Cocoa Cluster Frappuccino. Starbucks plans to open its first normal coffee shops in the city by the end of year. Mr. Johnson said the sites have been identified and work on them has begun. He declined to say how much had been invested in the first Milan roastery or how many of the traditional Starbucks cafes would be opened.

The multilevel Milan roastery features a bar with a 30-foot countertop cut from a single piece of Tuscan marble. Other draws include outdoor seating in one of Milan’s most central squares, a glass ceiling and an entire wall depicting the company’s history engraved in brass.

Later this year, Starbucks will inaugurate a similar roastery in New York near Chelsea Market with openings in Tokyo and Chicago planned for 2019.

For Italians who like to knock back their €1 ($1.16) shot of espresso at speed—while standing at a crowded bar, naturalmente—the American way of lingering in a Starbucks could be a tough sell.

Even tougher might be getting Italians, and Milan’s tourists, to swallow the €1.80 price of an espresso and the €5 cappuccino, more than three times the going price in hundreds of other bars in Milan. And toughest of all could be getting the Italians to accept that a cappuccino can be “short,” “tall” or “grande.”

“It’s going to be difficult to draw us away from our usual bar, but we’ll definitely go see what Starbucks is offering,” said Antonella Mazzei as she and two colleagues emerged from a cafe two blocks away from the new Starbucks. “Anything new is welcome and good for Milan.”

Ms. Mazzei said she can imagine going to Starbucks occasionally for something special, but she can’t see herself paying €1.80 for a Starbucks espresso. Her regular bar, across from her office, sells 10 prepaid espressi for €9.

For one euro more, the new Starbucks cafe will offer a global debut, the €10 “Pantheon Blend Cream Affogato.” It’s a riff on a popular Italian dessert, made by pouring espresso over a scoop of ice cream. The Starbucks version includes ice cream made to order using liquid nitrogen. Alternatively, there will be the €10 “whiskey barrel-aged cold brew,” sweetened with vanilla syrup aged in casks.

Local bar workers are relatively sanguine about the arrival of Starbucks.

“We aren’t worried about losing business because Starbucks is offering a completely different concept,” said Marilena Muzzolini, who manages a cafe near the Starbucks. “I like Starbucks and I’ve been in Paris and London, but I don’t go there for an Italian espresso and I don’t think very many other Italians will either. You go to Starbucks for different things.”

"Though Sen. Cory Booker and other Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee suggested that they were willing to accept the consequences of releasing confidential documents on Thursday in violation of Senate rules, no one is likely to face any serious blowback for such actions.

First, the Supreme Court has held that members of Congress have wide immunity from criminal penalties related to their official actions, up to and including the release of classified information. That is rooted in the ""speech or debate clause,"" a constitutional provision which was written to preserve the independence and autonomy of members of Congress.

In any case, the information in question is merely privileged, and does not appear to relate to any national security or defense information.

Second, while the Senate has the power to censure or expel its own members as a way to enforce discipline, an expulsion requires 66 votes. Democrats currently control 49 seats in the body and are exceedingly unlikely to support expulsion over such an action. A censure resolution requires just a simple majority but is nonbinding and merely expresses official disapproval.

Another possible disciplinary action is that members could be stripped of their committee assignments. Given the sheer number of Senate Democrats participating in the protest, such an action would essentially involve reshuffling the entire Judiciary Committee.

In fact, Mr. Akesson is the leader of the far-right Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in neo-Nazism that is poised to become a leading political force in Sunday’s elections. And he credits the rise to the party’s stance on crime in Sweden, which is seeing rising rates of rape and of murder involving firearms that he blames on its liberal asylum policy.

Nationalists and antiestablishment groups have flourished around Europe since a wave of refugees sparked a crisis across the continent in 2015.

But Sweden, one of the world’s most affluent and progressive nations, is poised for a particularly dramatic swing from a broad liberal consensus to extreme polarization. Polls put the Sweden Democrats in first or second place, and either outcome could leave center-left and center-right blocs struggling to form a stable government.

Sweden’s economy is growing, jobs are plentiful and the welfare system leaves no one by the wayside. And overall crime rates, while high by Western European standards, remain low, particularly when compared with the U.S.

Yet immigration has become the defining issue in the campaign, in part because many Swedes are rattled by surging violent crime in small urban enclaves populated mostly by people of foreign origin.

A shrine in Rosengard with a picture of a youth who was killed in a recent street shootout.

When President Trump declared last year that Sweden was struggling with immigration, he drew global condemnation and a social media campaign called #LastNightInSweden.

But several Swedish researchers and commentators—many from immigrant families—are now echoing his criticism, helping to erode a decadelong pro-immigration consensus.

Sweden has been taking more than five times more refugees per capita than the U.S. for over a decade, according to Joakim Ruist, an economist at the University of Gothenburg. It accepted 160,000 asylum seekers in 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis.

Today, over a fifth of Sweden’s 10 million people have foreign roots and the migrant community is often poorly integrated.

Unemployment is around 4% among native Swedes but exceeds 16% among the foreign born, and 23% for non-European immigrants, despite generous subsidies for companies that hire migrants, said Tino Sanandaji, an economist who wrote an acclaimed book on immigration policy.

Concerns about immigration have boosted support for the Sweden Democrats and pushed parties that have supported immigration to harden their rhetoric. Ulf Kristersson, leader of the center-right opposition, said its past immigration policy has been “very unsuccessful.”

The Sweden Democrats were founded in the late 1980s, and the group’s early incarnations included Swedish neo-Nazis and members of white nationalist movements.

The party renounced such ideology nearly two decades ago. The 39-year-old Mr. Akesson, who took over in 2005 and hasn’t been linked to neo-Nazism, has polished the party’s hard edges to woo centrist voters and even conservative immigrants. The party first entered parliament in 2010, with 5.7% of the vote.

Like Mr. Akesson, many pollsters credit the party’s rising support to growing fears about crime. Last year, police reported more than 320 shootings, dozens of bombings, and 7,226 rapes—a 10% increase over 2016. Norway, a nation half the size of Sweden, recorded only one gun homicide in 2017 compared with Sweden’s 43. Mr. Akesson cites data reported by Sweden’s national broadcaster showing that 58% of convicted rapists were foreigners in a recent five-year period.

Ulf Bostrom, a Gothenburg police officer, makes a point of not carrying weapons or body armor when he visits neighborhoods with large numbers of immigrants, because he believes it helps him establish a rapport with residents.

Hand grenades are being used so freely by criminal gangs that they are now cheaper than ice cream cones in high-crime neighborhoods, according to police.

The Ipsos Global Worry survey, published in July, showed that 73% of Swedes thought the country was heading in the wrong direction—the fifth worst result among 28 countries surveyed.

The gloom isn’t limited to native Swedes. Gamal El Fahl, an Egyptian refugee, says he will vote for the Sweden Democrats because of rampant crime in the Hjällbo district of Gothenburg, where he lives.

“Sweden has become dangerous since I came here 27 years ago. It will be a disaster if they accept more people from the Middle East like myself,” he said. “They are importing their values, their fanaticism.”

Hjällbo is one of 61 places in Sweden designated as “vulnerable areas” by police, because of a mix of criminality and social problems.

During the daytime, such problems are almost invisible thanks to high public spending on infrastructure and generous welfare benefits for all. But after dark, gangs rule many of these places, said Ulf Bostrom, a Gothenburg police officer.

A former weightlifter, Mr. Bostrom makes a point of not carrying weapons or body armor when he visits neighborhoods with large numbers of immigrants, because he believes it helps him establish a rapport with residents.

“Ethnic Swedes moved out of these areas over the last three decades, and a small number of criminals and religious extremists are keeping the population hostage,” he said. “Yet instead of solving problems, politicians have been saying that even discussing ethnicity and culture is racist.”

“Kids here talk about going to each other’s funerals,” said Christian Glasnovic, standing, who runs a Rosengard youth center.

Morgan Johansson, the country’s center-left justice minister, says the growing role of immigration in the political conversation is a broader European trend.

“For 25 years we have had problems with gang-related crime,” he said. “This has nothing to do with the immigration crisis of 2015.”

Yet many in Sweden don’t trust parties that have held power for decades to tackle the country’s challenges, said Patrik Ohberg, a political scientist.

In Rosengard, a district of the city of Malmö that has seen 10 murders this year, inspector Mats Svensson said children as young as 15 are being used by gangs to transport murder weapons, including Kalashnikov assault rifles.

Virtually all crime suspects—and victims—are of foreign origin, he said, yet the state has no policy to end the vicious circle. “We can’t go on like this. We need to stop mass immigration and take care of these neighborhoods before racism starts to spread together with crime.”

Yet most would have been impossible without the president’s support, which Mr. Bush gave unreservedly from start to finish.

Mr. Bush’s unsung role merits greater appreciation today. Ten years after the crisis, the financial system is stronger, but the political system is far more fragile. Polarization, populism and protectionism mean the next crisis will be met with far less political will than the last.

You don’t have to look far to see the potential potential consequences. Fractured politics are largely why the eurozone took so much longer to respond to and recover from its crisis than the U.S. The bloc lacks a unified fiscal authority, so decisions on how to commit public funds had to pass muster with a skeptical German public. For that reason the eurozone insisted on austerity and Draconian bailout terms for crisis-stricken countries that worsened the downturn. The European Central Bank couldn’t take the sorts of radical steps the Fed did for at least two years because of German political resistance.

The Depression tells a similar story. President Herbert Hoover’s efforts to stem growing unemployment and bank failures fell short because he wanted private-sector solutions when government money was needed. One promising effort to shore up shaky banks with public money fizzled when an indignant Congress demanded recipients’ names be published, a stigma that drove banks away. Mr. Hoover signed tariff and tax increases into law out of misguided political orthodoxy.

Lessons Learned Congress, presidents and the Fed acted faster and more effectively during the last crisis than during the Depression. Manufacturing production, start of recession=100 100 ’10 2008 ’12 5 2007-12 6 7 8 80 1 1929-34 60 2 3 4 40 ’32 ’34 1930 Bank of United States fails 1 Reconstruction Finance Corp. launched 2 Franklin D. Roosevelt elected president 3 FDR takes office; bank holiday announced, dollar delinked from gold 4 Lehman Brothers fails; AIG bailed out 5 TARP passes Congress 6 Obama elected 7 Obama takes office 8

After Franklin D. Roosevelt defeated Mr. Hoover in 1932, speculation mounted that he would suspend the dollar’s convertibility to gold. Shortly after taking office he did, which was critical in reversing the economy’s downward spiral. But the four months in which he didn’t answer speculation on his plans for the dollar accelerated the outflow of gold and the resulting tidal wave of bank failures.

Mr. Bush’s legacy is overshadowed by many controversies of his own making, such as the U.S. invasion of Iraq, but his responsibility for causing the crisis that would cost his party the White House was at most minor and shared with predecessors.

Nonetheless, he was prepared to abandon political orthodoxy to fix it. In his memoir, Mr. Bush recalls lobbying a Republican congressman to approve the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which would eventually inject billions of dollars into banks. The legislator protested that he couldn’t be “part of the destruction of the free market.” Mr. Bush retorted: “Do you think I like the idea of doing this? Believe me, I’d be fine if these companies fail. But the whole economy is on the line.”

Unlike Roosevelt, Barack Obama didn’t allow a dangerous vacuum to form as the White House changed hands. He stayed in touch with Mr. Paulson during the 2008 election campaign, mustered Democratic votes for TARP, and appointed Mr. Geithner his Treasury Secretary. Mr. Geithner devised the “stress tests” that restored confidence in the banking system. (John McCain, the Republican candidate, vacillated more on bailouts, though he ultimately voted for TARP.) Still, for all the credit Mr. Obama is given for turning the economy around, the toughest decisions were made by Mr. Bush.

They will be far harder to make in the next crisis. Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, has just published a meticulous study of debt crises as a free e-book. In an interview, he says a significant takeaway is that resolving a crisis depends in great part on whether the crisis fighters “have the knowledge and authority to make decisions or if they are encumbered by the political environment.”

Chinese leaders, he believes, have both the necessary know-how and authority to deal with an eventual crisis. For the U.S., he’s more pessimistic, partly because its leaders have fewer tools: interest rates can’t be lowered as much, and Congress curbed much of the discretion the Fed and Treasury used to stem the panic. Politically, Mr. Dalio believes inequality and populism will only worsen in the next downturn, depriving crisis managers of the political freedom they need to make unpopular decisions.

President Trump is adept at feeling the pulse of his base at any given moment and shifting his position accordingly, yet crisis management often requires doing the opposite of what the public demands. His belief that international relations are zero-sum would make cross-border cooperation harder. Meanwhile, what little unity the eurozone was able to muster in recent years will be harder with populists now governing Italy and leading the opposition in Germany.

Much of Mr. Bush’s legacy has been dismissed by Democrats and renounced by Republicans. Yet when the next crisis rolls around, both may find they miss him.

"“A gentleman is one who never hurts anyone’s feelings—unintentionally.”

The quip is attributed to Oscar Wilde, and the sentiment is capacious enough to include Donald Trump. For even the most ardent Never Trumper would concede that when this president offends, it’s intentional.

During the 2016 campaign, for example, Mr. Trump claimed a judge’s Mexican heritage meant he couldn’t be impartial. He belittled a Muslim mom and dad whose U.S. Army officer son had given his life in Iraq. And he declared John McCain was “not a war hero” because he had been a prisoner of war. The insults continued in the Oval Office, from regular jabs at “Crooked Hillary” to “low IQ” tweets variously directed at MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski, actor Robert De Niro and Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.).

As America heads toward the November midterms, one fruit of Mr. Trump’s insults is a national lecture about the need to restore civility and norms to our politics. The latest campaign was launched Friday when Barack Obama, in what he conceded was his own departure from a long-established norm of “ex-presidents gracefully exiting the political stage,” scored the Republican Congress for its “phony” civility and savaged his successor as an existential threat to democracy.

Yet the civility offensive is not without contradiction. How is it that those who presume they posses the moral standing to preach on Mr. Trump’s incivility are so conspicuously blind to the equally glaring outrages of his critics?

Was it civil, for example, for Hillary Clinton to dismiss half of Trump voters as “deplorables” who were also “irredeemable”? Is it civil that showing up with a “Make America Great Again” cap can invite a beating?

Perhaps this explains why the civility conversation is mostly confined to those who already agree. In the past few months alone, after all, Americans have watched press secretary Sarah Sanders and her family hounded out of a Virginia restaurant while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife were harassed by young men. More recently, John McCain’s memorial services became a weeklong taunt to the president—all by the same people applauding each other for their exquisite decency.

The denouement was telling as well. Two days after McCain was laid to rest at his beloved U.S. Naval Academy, the Senate Judiciary Committee began confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

Talk about incivility and norm-breaking. Leave aside the disruptive audience members. When Democratic senators weren’t interrupting Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, they were attempting to smear a decent and respected husband, father and jurist. Surely the proposition that Mr. Trump has a monopoly on rudeness and incivility took a beating from the antics of Sen. Cory Booker.

Of course, the New Jersey Democrat’s conscious defiance of Senate decorum is but the latest in a long line of progressive norm-shattering. Anyone remember when the New York Times announced on its front page that the journalistic norm of objectivity shouldn’t apply to Mr. Trump?

Or the reporter who used the F-word in a tweet accusing the president of incest with his daughter, and yet has not been rendered morally unfit by the world of journalism?

Or, less salaciously, those who illegally unmasked national security adviser Mike Flynn? Those who have leaked the president’s phone calls with foreign leaders? What about Sally Yates, the acting attorney general who refused a lawful presidential order?

This is civility? These are people concerned with norms? Forgive those Americans who concur with blogger Ann Althouse that today’s pious demands for civility are often less about good manners than shutting down folks with an opposing view. Certainly the anti-Trump side has indulged in plenty of the latter, whether it be the Obama Internal Revenue Service targeting tea party, pro-Israel and pro-life nonprofits for harassment or rioters who would rather set university buildings on fire than allow a conservative point to be uttered on a woke campus.

On top of this, anyone even vaguely familiar with how respectable Washington defamed Judge Robert Bork and grossly distorted his record during his Supreme Court hearings further appreciates that incivility didn’t start when Mr. Trump came to town. It wasn’t all that long ago when Republicans were—falsely—blamed for a nutjob’s shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords in 2011.

During our last national outburst of disquisitions on political comity, columnist Froma Harrop, as head of the National Conference of Editorial Writers, was running something called “the Civility Project.” In 2012, John Oliver of “The Daily Show” had great sport with Ms. Harrop for seeing no contradiction between her leading the charge for civility even as she defended likening tea partiers to al Qaeda terrorists.

None of this justifies Mr. Trump’s own excesses. But it may help explain why so many on the receiving end of today’s civility sermons aren’t buying.

"The escalating territorial disputes in the Pacific between China and America’s allies create an ever-more-urgent need for U.S. sea power. But even as China rapidly expands and modernizes its navy, the Trump administration has not proposed enough funds to maintain America’s maritime advantage. Beginning with the coming 2019 federal budget, the president and Congress must commit to funding a full, modern fleet—or risk ceding essential U.S. and allied interests.

American sea power has secured the Pacific since the end of World War II, assuring safe and open trade, while defusing conflict throughout the region. Maintaining a powerful navy for these ends is hardly an American innovation: No great state or empire has ever retained its status without pre-eminent sea power. The histories of Athens, Venice, Spain, Holland and England show that losing control of the oceans leads ineluctably to losing great-power status.

The rapid growth and improvement of China’s naval forces is the major challenge to American sea dominance today, and likely for the foreseeable future. Retired Capt. James Fanell, former director of intelligence for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, stated in 2015 that China’s combat fleet will reach 415 ships in 2030. Beijing is particularly focused on adding submarines, amphibious vessels and small surface combatants. The buildup demonstrates China’s clear intention to dominate in coastal regions and amphibious operations—domains in which the U.S. has pre-eminence today.

As Adm. Phil Davidson, nominated to lead the U.S. Pacific Command, told the Senate in April: China “is no longer a rising power but an arrived great power and peer competitor.” He added that “China has undergone a rapid military modernization over the last three decades and is approaching parity in a number of critical areas; there is no guarantee that the United States would win a future conflict with China.”

The White House has proposed expanding the U.S. Navy to 355 ships, but its plan is too slow and underfunded. The full fleet would not be complete until 2050 at the earliest. Although President Trump proposes to dedicate $20 billion for new ship construction in 2019, and about the same in constant dollars in each of the next five years, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the project requires an additional $6.6 billion a year over the next 30 years. Without increased funding, the fleet will be smaller in three decades than it is today, and China’s navy could surpass it by 2030.

Americans would quickly see the consequences of ceding power in the Pacific. Already, China’s growing navy may soon aim to control movement around the first island chain in the East China Sea, which stretches from Japan to the Philippines.

If Beijing gains control of the region, it could hamper America’s coordination with its allies and cast doubt on the U.S. security umbrella. The White House would find it more difficult to prevent distant crises from escalating into direct threats. American business around the world, meanwhile, would be decimated. China would suddenly become the more appealing partner for trade and security. The global maritime order, which has long maintained that the East and South China Seas are international waters, would be replaced by a regional system based on “Chinese characteristics”—the euphemism by which the Chinese Communist Party refers to its brand of state control.

This is not a fait accompli; American sea power can be restored. But it will require the U.S. to decide that its status as the world’s great power is worth preserving. The Navy’s evolutionary approach to modernizing its fleet must be replaced by a revolutionary approach, increasing the current fleet’s technological advantage. And by 2035, the fleet should be expanded to no fewer than 375 ships.

The U.S. must also prepare to engage China’s navy. That means situating U.S. forces within striking distance of the East and South China Seas, with enough troops on hand to police the region effectively. It also means responding in kind to China’s existing provocations. The U.S. should bolster its military and naval support for Taiwan. The Pentagon should lean forward by actively planning to defend the entire first island chain, as well as to blockade the Southeast Asia straits, through which oil from the Middle East now flows to China.

Conflict may come sooner than most Americans imagine. This month alone, Beijing is reported to have placed anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles on three artificial islands in the South China Sea. The U.S. also recently said that American military pilots in Djibouti have been hit with lasers fired from a new Chinese base. The Pentagon has filed a diplomatic démarche requesting that China investigate, but mere diplomacy won’t suffice in the game Beijing is playing.

Timidity deters nothing. It encourages the increasing Chinese aggression. But so far America’s plans to upgrade the U.S. combat fleet have been diffident. To remain the world’s dominant maritime force, U.S. sea power will have to be trained, equipped and exercised. On this rests the future of the U.S. as a great power.

"It was a little less than a century ago that Woodrow Wilson suffered his disabling stroke. He was on the presidential train on a siding near Wichita, Kan., in the midst of his exhausting cross-country whistle-stop tour. He was trying to sell the League of Nations to the American people over the heads of the U.S. Senate and Henry Cabot Lodge. If Twitter had been available in 1919, Wilson might have skipped the tour, avoided the stress, and escaped the stroke.

As the tragedy played out, Wilson was more or less confined for the rest of his second term to the twilight of his sickroom, protected from visitors except for carefully arranged audiences meant to fool Congress and the public into thinking that all was well, or anyway not so bad. For 16 months, First Lady Edith Wilson, presidential physician Cary Grayson and private secretary Joseph Tumulty in effect exercised the powers of the presidency.

It was a strange interlude. The country survived. The election of 1920 proceeded in due course, and—not that it was much improvement—brought forth the brief, corrupt presidency of Warren G. Harding.

Now a “senior official” in the Trump White House—in league with the New York Times—has attempted, in effect, to inflict a stroke and a twilight upon the 45th president, and to declare publicly what Mrs. Wilson kept private: that the president is disabled (given to “instability” and “erratic behavior,” according to the anonymous senior official) and that, in his stead, the sane and steady ones will manage Mr. Trump and govern the world, as if in saintly reminder of George Eliot’s lines at the end of Middlemarch: “that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.”

Yond “senior official” has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much—or perhaps he thinks too little and too smugly. The official and the Times are perhaps conjuring episodes of “Mission Impossible,” in which the IMF (the Impossible Missions Force) surrounds a target person (the president, in this case) with the illusion of an Oval Office and a Rose Garden and limousines and all of his constitutional powers, while in actuality the office of president is being conducted by a secret Committee of the Wise and Sane and Just, with the advice and consent of the Times editorial board.

The ploy is unconstitutional—a mutiny against the democratic process. But is it necessary nonetheless? If so, how is the great danger (an incompetent or radically unstable president) to be handled? Who makes the call?

Before answering, one should consider a subsidiary puzzle: If it is true that the senior official and his colleagues have quietly set themselves up as the Edith Wilson and Joe Tumulty of the Trump administration, why on earth would they jeopardize the task they had set themselves—to contain Mr. Trump and keep the country from running off the rails—by publishing an article in the New York Times announcing that they had done so? Does he imagine that only fellow members of the “resistance” read the Times? The article will surely lead to the identification of its author; it could not possibly have any other effect than to further destabilize the White House and further enrage the besieged president. If the senior official truly had the best interests of the country at heart, he would have kept secret what he is doing, not only his identity.

Publishing the essay makes the author look like a partisan phony whose purpose is not to advance the interests of the American people but rather to inflame voters against Mr. Trump in advance of the November elections. The timing of the op-ed is more than suspicious, coming at just the moment when the contents of Bob Woodward’s book “Fear” (the title itself is pure propaganda) were fed to world-wide media—filled with anecdotes supporting the senior official’s version of a mad and incompetent king.

The moment is enriched by the Kavanaugh hearings, with their background theatrics, which themselves might have been arranged by the IMF people: hysterical screamers, and women dressed up in costumes from “The Handmaid’s Tale.” I suspect that the entire performance—the Woodward book, the unidentified senior official’s usurpation by op-ed, the screaming, the Handmaids—will be greeted, out in the still-flourishing regions of common sense, as a gaudy, disgraceful example of jumping the shark.

Woodrow Wilson never should have been permitted to remain president after he was disabled. Franklin D. Roosevelt, in disastrously bad health, should never have sought a fourth term in 1944. There were plenty of people inside the Lyndon B. Johnson White House (the late Richard Goodwin was one of them) who believed that, toward the end of his presidency, Johnson was clinically paranoid—deeply unstable and virtually disabled. Richard Nixon’s sanity at the end was questioned by those closest to him.

Almost always in these cases, loyal White House people step in, quietly and selflessly, to protect the country’s interests. Meantime, certain constitutional processes may come into play. We are not there yet.

In the current case, the anonymous senior and self-canonized saint in the White House seems to be involved in some other game, more partisan, complex and craven.

"Former President Barack Obama Friday accused President Trump of “capitalizing on resentment” and called on voters to engage in the midterm elections, which he said are “more important than any I can remember in my lifetime.”

“Just a glance at recent headlines should tell you that this moment really is different, the stakes really are higher, the consequences of any of us sitting on the sidelines are more dire,” Mr. Obama said in a speech at the University of Illinois. “This is not normal.”

Mr. Obama bridled at efforts by Mr. Trump and his allies to claim credit for the improving economy, saying it was a process begun under his presidency.

“When you hear how great the economy is doing right now, let’s just remember when this recovery started,” he said. “Suddenly Republicans are saying it’s a miracle. I have to remind them those job numbers are the same numbers as 2015 and 2016.”

Until now, Mr. Obama had withheld open criticism of Mr. Trump, keeping to a tradition of former presidents refraining from attacking their successors. In his address, he said he was stepping out “as a fellow citizen, not an ex-president” with a call to action. “I am here to deliver a simple message: You need to vote because our democracy depends on it,” he said.

Speaking at a Republican fundraiser in Fargo, N.D., President Trump said he watched Mr. Obama’s speech earlier in the day, “but I fell asleep.”

“I found that he’s very good, very good for sleeping,” Mr. Trump said, prompting laughs from the crowd. “He was trying to take credit for this incredible thing that’s happening to our country.”

Friday’s speech was the kickoff of a series of midterm campaign events by Mr. Obama, beginning Saturday with a rally in California with seven Democratic candidates in battleground House seats that the party hopes to flip from the GOP.

Mr. Obama is one of the most popular national Democrats, but Republicans say they welcome his return to the political scene, if only to give them another figure that Republicans love to hate.

“For three cycles, President Obama fired up Republicans like nobody and I’m happy if he wants to do it again,” said Rep. Steve Stivers (R., Ohio), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, at a breakfast with reporters Friday.

Mr. Obama also lambasted Republicans for refusing to stand up to Mr. Trump, and ridiculed the message of a recent New York Times op-ed from an anonymous senior administration official that some were working from within to check his more dangerous instincts and policies.

He accused Republicans of “bending over backwards to shield this behavior from scrutiny.”

Mr. Obama’s months of steering clear of national politics, while frustrating to some activists, was in keeping with the practice of his predecessor. George W. Bush took a big step back from politics after leaving the White House; the first time he stepped back in was in 2016 when he campaigned for his brother, Jeb, for president.

Last year, Mr. Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates for governor of Virginia and of New Jersey, who won their races. He has attended high-end fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee and other party groups, including a new one, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee that is focusing on funding races that will strengthen the party’s hand in redrawing congressional district lines after the 2020 census. Last month, he endorsed 81 Democrats who were running for Congress, governor and other down-ballot posts in the 2018 midterms.

But his California rally is his first on-the-stump campaigning of 2018, starting in a deep blue state that has a clutch of candidates in seven GOP-held districts that are key to Democrats’ hope of winning a House majority. After that he will go to Ohio, a state he won twice, but which Mr. Trump won in 2016.

“It’s truly exciting to welcome President Obama to Southern California,” said Gil Cisneros, one of the House candidates appearing with him at a Saturday rally in Orange County. “I welcome the opportunity to campaign alongside him and energize voters ahead of the final two months of the campaign.”

Mr. Obama will likely steer clear of red states where Mr. Trump is a GOP hero and Democratic senators are struggling for re-election—including some like Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who kept her distance from Mr. Obama when she first ran in 2012.

“Whether Barack Obama is physically there or not, red-state Democrats are going to have to be prepared to defend their votes during President Obama’s tenure,” said David Krone, who was chief of staff to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid during the Obama presidency.

In 2014, the last midterm of Mr. Obama’s presidency, he was considered a political liability to Senate Democrats in battleground states like Arkansas, Louisiana and Alaska. Incumbents were attacked for their record of voting with Mr. Obama, whose approval rating hit a low of 40% in August 2014, according to Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling. Vulnerable Democrats ran away from him, but they still lost, and the GOP gained a majority in the Senate.

Now Mr. Obama is one of the most popular national Democrats in or out of office, with 57% positive rating in the January 2017 Journal/NBC poll. Activists view him as more unifying and inspirational than congressional leaders, Nancy Pelosi in the House and Chuck Schumer in the Senate, or the party’s official chairman, Tom Perez of the Democratic National Committee.

But some Democrats worry that Mr. Obama’s emergence, and his attack on Mr. Trump, will further turn the midterm campaign into a polarized referendum on Mr. Trump instead of about policy.

“President Obama may be feeding that dynamic where it is all about President Trump,” Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said on CNN.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), responding to Mr. Obama’s speech, said it would remind voters of the problems of the Obama era, such as slower economic growth, and why they rejected Democrat Hillary Clinton as his successor.

“The more former President Obama speaks about the ‘good ol years’ of his presidency, the more likely President Trump is to get re-elected,” Mr. Graham said.

"WASHINGTON—President Trump on Thursday denied Hurricane Maria caused 3,000 deaths in Puerto Rico, falsely accusing Democrats of inflating the toll to “make me look as bad as possible.”

“3,000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico,” Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday. “When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3,000.”

Mr. Trump added: “This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!”

Researchers at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health, commissioned by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, in a report last month estimated there were 2,975 excess deaths in Puerto Rico from September 2017 through February 2018 stemming from last year’s hurricane. That far surpassed the original official count.

Puerto Rico’s government—led by a governor with the island’s pro-statehood party who is also a Democrat—faced criticism for nearly a year after the hurricane that it drastically undercounted the number of fatalities caused by Maria. Last month, it acknowledged in a document filed to Congress that the death toll from Maria was much higher than the official total.

The researchers estimated the number of excess deaths by analyzing death certificates and other mortality data, and comparing the number of deaths during the designated period with past mortality patterns. They calculated the total number of deaths in the period was 22% higher than the number of fatalities that would have been expected, the researchers said.

In analyzing Puerto Rico’s death-certification process, the study found that listed causes of death included cardiac arrest, respiratory failure and septicemia. But researchers concluded that such causes were sometimes misassigned, with physicians failing to link the deaths to the hurricane.

The Milken Institute School of Public Health, which conducted the study, on Thursday issued a statement saying it stood by the science of its report, which it said was “carried out with complete independence and freedom from any kind of interference.”

Mr. Rosselló responded to Mr. Trump’s tweet by reiterating his administration’s confidence in the George Washington University study and its estimated death count.

“The victims and the people of Puerto Rico do not deserve to have their pain questioned,” Mr. Rosselló said. “They deserve recognition of that impact by our president…We strongly denounce anyone who would use this disaster or question our suffering for political purposes.”

Mr. Rosselló also asked Mr. Trump to ensure that federal agencies invest the necessary resources to help the island recover.

The Trump administration faced criticism for its relief efforts in Puerto Rico from lawmakers in both parties, who have said the White House was too slow to respond in the wake of the hurricane and didn’t send enough people to the island to rebuild infrastructure and speed medical supplies, food and water to communities there.

Weeks before Maria hit, Puerto Rico’s electricity grid had been hit hard when Hurricane Irma passed off the island’s north coast, knocking out power for more than 1 million people. Thousands who lost power during Irma never had it restored before Maria hit.

Puerto Rico didn’t restore power to many parts of the island until last month, meaning some residents on the island lacked power for nearly a year after the hurricane.

San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruztweeted to the president on Thursday: “Shame on you,” including a picture of his tweet. She added: “Damn it: this is NOT about politics this was always about SAVING LIVES.”

Lawmakers in both parties on Thursday criticized the president’s tweet, with some casting blame on the federal government’s relief efforts for the high death toll. “You’re right, Mr. President,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) said in a tweet. “The hurricane didn’t kill 3,000 people. Your botched response did.”

“Casualties don’t make a person look bad,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said of the president’s tweets, adding that he visited the island and he believes the analysis done on the death toll.

“I have no reason to dispute those numbers. Those are just the facts when a horrible hurricane hits an isolated island,” he said.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a staunch ally of the president who is running for Senate, tweeted: “I disagree with @POTUS—an independent study said thousands were lost and Gov. Rosselló agreed.” He added: “The extent of lives lost as a result of Maria is heart wrenching.” And Rep. Ron DeSantis, who won the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Florida with Mr. Trump’s endorsement, issued a statement saying “he doesn’t believe any loss of life has been inflated.”

Nearly 12 hours after Mr. Trump’s tweets, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley issued a statement praising the administration’s “unprecedented support” for Puerto Rico. Mr. Gidley said the president’s tweets were “responding to the liberal media and the San Juan mayor, who sadly have tried to exploit the devastation by pushing out a constant stream of misinformation and false accusations.”

Ms. Yulín Cruz had criticized Mr. Trump’s comments earlier in the week describing his administration’s response in Puerto Rico as a “success.” On Tuesday, she tweeted: “Can you imagine what he thinks failure looks like?”

Last month, following the release of the report, the White House released a statement from press secretary Sarah Sanders saying the government “has been, and will continue to be, supportive of Mr. Rosselló’s efforts to ensure a full accountability and transparency of fatalities resulting from last year’s hurricanes.”

A report earlier this month by the Government Accountability Office described the government as “down to the bottom of the barrel” in staffing by the time Maria hit Puerto Rico, citing a series of other hurricanes and catastrophic wildfires last year that overwhelmed federal disaster responders. The report said the GAO has a number of audits pending that will analyze issues such as the restoration of power in Puerto Rico.

Mr. Trump earlier this week described his administration’s efforts in Puerto Rico as an “unsung success.”

The researchers pointed to several problems in the death-certification process that contributed to the island government’s initial undercounting of fatalities. Among them were a lack of training for physicians on how to certify deaths after a natural disaster and the government’s lack of communication about proper death-certificate reporting before the 2017 hurricane season.

Mr. Trump’s tweets Thursday came as Hurricane Florencehurtles toward the East Coast. The president, whose calendar has been cleared for the day in light of the coming storm, spent the morning tweeting attacks on the JP Morgan Chase & Co. chief executive and complaining about the Russia investigation.

Of Florence, he warned: “Be careful!”

"The White House said Iranian-backed militias in Iraq had carried out “life-threatening attacks” against the U.S. consulate in Basra and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and warned Washington would hold Tehran responsible if there are future assaults.

“The United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to United States government facilities,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday. “America will respond swiftly and decisively in defense of American lives.”

The statement followed an attack on Saturday in which several rockets were fired at the Basra airport, where the U.S. consulate is located.

At least one rocket also was fired at the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad, where the U.S. Embassy is based, and mortar fire also struck the Green Zone earlier in the week. No Americans were injured and no U.S. property was hit in the attacks.

U.S. officials haven’t made public any evidence that Iran ordered the attacks, and some U.S. officials said the Shiite militias may have been acting on their own. But the White House statement faults Iran for failing to stop the attacks, which it alleges were carried out by proxies Tehran has armed, trained and financed.

The rocket attack in Basra followed accusations by Abu Medhi al-Mohandis, a Shiite militia commander who U.S. officials say has long been supported by Iran, that the U.S. was responsible for demonstrations in which the Iranian consulate in the city was stormed and set on fire and the offices of most political parties, including Iranian-backed paramilitary groups, were destroyed.

“The American Embassy is directing the situation in Basra,” said Mr. Mohandis, who the U.S. has designated a terrorist for his role in the bombing of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in the 1980s.

While some initial news reports suggested that the Basra airport was the target of the rocket fire, one U.S. official said it is clear that the real objective was the U.S. diplomatic mission there.

“Given the explicit incitement in social media,” the official said, “the U.S. government has no doubt that this was directed at the U.S.”

Iran trained and armed Shiite militias that attacked U.S. troops during the Iraq war—a role that was confirmed by newly declassified interrogation reports of a prominent Shiite figure.

But Iran and the U.S. have had a truce of sorts since U.S. forces returned to Iraq in 2014 to help the Iraqis fight Islamic State militants. Until last week, Shiite militias have refrained from attacks on U.S. forces or diplomats.

U.S. officials described some of the weapons used in the recent attacks as relatively primitive when compared with more advanced roadside bombs, the so-called Explosively Formed Penetrators, and other weapons that Iran provided to Shiite militias during the Iraq war.

"WASHINGTON—The House overwhelmingly rejected an immigration bill Wednesday intended as a compromise between different wings of the GOP, hobbling the party’s efforts to address the issue ahead of the midterm elections.

The bill failed 301 to 121, with all Democrats and 112 Republicans—almost half of the party’s 235 House members—opposing the measure. The wide margin of defeat, rarely seen on the House floor, marked an embarrassment for GOP leaders and highlighted how divided both the party and the broader House are on a comprehensive immigration bill.

The compromise effort drew less support than a more conservative alternative that was defeated last week but which still garnered votes from 193 Republicans.

The legislation would have provided six years of renewable legal status to young immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors and living in the country without legal authorization, a group often known as Dreamers, and ultimately would have offered them a pathway to citizenship. It also would have provided $23.4 billion for border security, ended a diversity-visa lottery program and cut family-based immigration—in line with goals laid out by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

With Democrats viewing the measure as too harsh, Republicans were left to corral a majority from within their own party. But disagreements over conservative priorities, such as writing in new restrictions to prevent the young immigrants from sponsoring their parents for citizenship, left the bill well short of passage.

Mr. Trump, after declining to throw his full weight behind the bill, issued an all-caps tweet Wednesday morning that House Republicans should pass the “STRONG BUT FAIR” bill even if it would be blocked in the Senate, where a similar measure failed to pass earlier this year. The push was seen as too little too late, and many Republicans blamed Mr. Trump’s shifting positions on the legislation for dooming it to failure.

A hard-line approach to immigration helped propel Mr. Trump to the White House, but the collapse of the GOP immigration bill carries risks for Republicans in battleground districts. Many of those lawmakers have been pushing for relief for Dreamers.

“In the districts that will determine party control of the House after the midterm elections—primarily suburban districts and more diverse districts, it makes the Republicans’ task more challenging,” said GOP pollster Whit Ayres.

With the defeat of the House bill and the Supreme Court decision to uphold Mr. Trump’s so-called travel ban, any notions that Republicans could reposition themselves on the immigration issue before the midterms were dealt a heavy blow.

Republican leaders in the House now turn their attention to taking up narrower legislation that responds to the separation of children from their parents resulting from a Trump administration policy of prosecuting adult migrants for entering the country illegally.

A longstanding court agreement known as the Flores settlement prevents children from being jailed for more than 20 days, even with their parents. As a result, the administration had argued, Congress needed to change the laws to prevent the breakup of families under a new “zero tolerance” policy instituted in the spring.

The Senate is also focusing on narrow legislation to respond to the separation of families at the border, but the parties are far apart on basic principles such as whether to house immigrants in family-detention centers.

Related Video President Trump is seeking to detain parents and children who cross the border illegally together, but an old law could stand in the way of his new plan. WSJ's Shelby Holliday explains why the Flores Agreement has proved challenging for various administrations. Photo: Getty

Mr. Trump last week directed his administration to detain families together, but that is seen as running afoul of the Flores settlement. Democrats say the White House should return to policies under the Bush and Obama administrations of releasing migrants into U.S. communities while their asylum cases are pending.

“I hope that moving forward enough pressure can be brought to bear on House Republicans to end this anti-immigrant crusade and enact immigration reform that upholds our national character,” said Rep. Nita Lowey (D., N.Y.).

Some vulnerable centrist Republicans say that the likely next steps rest with the courts. Several federal judges have ruled against the Trump administration’s decision to cancel an Obama-era program protecting Dreamers.

“We may wind up in the U.S. Supreme Court,” said Rep. John Faso (R., N.Y.), who represents a swing district with a seat that is rated a tossup by the Cook Political Report.

GOP leaders allowed Wednesday’s vote to proceed despite its long odds due to a deal they had cut to head off a procedural maneuver known as a discharge petition. That move would have forced a series of floor votes that could have resulted in the passage of an immigration bill reflecting mostly Democratic priorities.

On Wednesday, the centrists who attempted to use the discharge petition maneuver acknowledged that they simply didn’t have the support to succeed. The centrists, led by Reps. Carlos Curbelo (R., Fla.) and Jeff Denham (R., Calif.), came up two signatures short of the number needed to force votes on the floor, and disclosed Wednesday that was their high water mark.

"WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump is considering revoking the security clearances of six former senior national security officials, the White House said Monday, moving to punish them for comments purportedly politicizing the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

“Making baseless accusations of improper contact with Russia or being influenced by Russia against the president is extremely inappropriate,” said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, without specifying.

The threat, which national security analysts described as unprecedented, prompted concerns it was an effort by the president to silence critics.

“An enemies list is ugly, undemocratic, and un-American,” said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee.

Ms. Sanders told reporters that the administration is looking at the clearances of former Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former director of the National Security Agency and the CIA Michael Hayden, former national security adviser and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

Ms. Sanders said the individuals, many of whom are outspoken critics of the administration in the news media, lend “inappropriate legitimacy to accusations with zero evidence.”

The episode appeared to have been touched off by a remark on Twitter Monday morning from Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) urging Mr. Trump to revoke Mr. Brennan’s clearance.

The individuals named left government service months or even years ago under varied circumstances, and some said Monday they either no longer had a security clearance or no longer received classified briefings.

Millions of Americans hold security clearances, needed for many government and private-sector jobs. The practice of having senior national security officials retain clearance after leaving government is longstanding and serves various functions, national security officials and analysts said.

National security officials often go on to work in the private sector, particularly at defense contractors, and need access to classified information to support the government. Former officials keep clearances to assist in ongoing criminal and national security investigations. The clearances offer continuity between administrations on intelligence and national security matters, and also would enable former officials to return to active service in a national emergency and offer expertise.

Having a security clearance doesn’t automatically afford a former official access to information. Rather the former official must have a need to know information on which he or she is briefed, analysts said.

“There really isn’t that much precedent of removing clearance of former national security official unless they are indicted or convicted of some criminal offense,” said Evan Lesser, president of ClearanceJobs, a career website. “But ultimately the president does have the power to grant or revoke clearances really to whomever he wants.”

A spokeswoman for Mr. McCabe, who was fired from the FBI two days shy of his retirement in connection with information he provided to a Wall Street Journal reporter ahead of the 2016 election, said his “security clearance was deactivated when he was terminated, according to what we were told was FBI policy.”

Benjamin Wittes, a Brookings Institution scholar and friend and sometime spokesman for Mr. Comey, said he no longer had a security clearance. Mr. Comey was fired by Mr. Trump in 2017 and has been highly critical of the president, in a book and in other venues.

Mr. Hayden, who maintains a security clearance, told The Wall Street Journal that he is occasionally called on to provide his view on national security matters but he doesn’t attend classified briefings.

Mr. Clapper, on CNN, said, “This is kind of a petty way of retribution for speaking out against the president.”

Of the former officials named by Ms. Sanders, among the most highly critical of Mr. Trump’s engagement with Russia is Mr. Brennan, who was CIA director under President Barack Obama and who now works as a national security analyst for NBC and MSNBC.

Mr. Brennan said Mr. Trump’s recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin was “nothing short of treasonous.”

"NAIROBI, Kenya—In the first formal diplomatic contact in two decades, officials from Eritrea met with their Ethiopian counterparts on Tuesday, a potential turning point in a long dispute over their border that has kept the region on edge.

A lasting rapprochement between the two countries would dissolve a fault-line that has isolated Eritrea. complicated alliances and fragmented the already conflict-prone Horn of Africa, where Western powers are invested militarily and deploy billions in humanitarian aid.

The Eritrean delegation, headed by the country’s foreign minister, Osman Sale, was greeted at the airport in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, by the new reformist Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who earlier this month unexpectedly said he wanted to resolve the dispute.

Tiny Eritrea fought a long war of independence against Ethiopia and in 1993 was formally recognized by the international community as an independent country, but sporadic violence has continued at hot spots in the border region.

A 2002 decision by a United Nations-backed commission found that Ethiopia had to withdraw from the border area, called Badme, ruling the territory rightfully belonged to Eritrea, but Ethiopia has never done so.

Resolving the Badme dispute would be a first important step in a long road to reconciliation, made bumpier by nationalists on both sides and mistrust after decades of fighting.

In the years since the war, Ethiopia, the continent’s second-most populous country with 104 million people, has staged an economic expansion that has seen it place among the fastest-growing countries in the world and launch a successful airline.

In seceding, Eritrea deprived its massive neighbor of access to the Red Sea, a handicap Ethiopia is still grappling with. Mr. Abiy’s call for reconciliation could eventually allow his country access to the sea, but could also, if successful, strengthen him politically against Ethiopia’s military as he tries to wrestle control from entrenched elites.

The ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front has established itself as a single-rule party, and keeps a tight rein on security with a strong, large army. Addis Ababa has also become a key regional ally for the U.S. in the war on terror, the European Union on migration, and China in commerce.

Meanwhile Eritrea, population roughly four million, has become isolated from the international community and slapped with U.N. sanctions for allegedly fostering Somali terrorists.

Its leader, Isaias Afewerki, has used the dispute with Ethiopia to keep the country in a permanent state of emergency, which includes a policy of indefinite, universal and mandatory conscription.

"Arizona and Florida have contested primaries for both parties Tuesday, while Oklahoma Republicans will choose a candidate for governor in the deep red state. The marquee Republican contests are tests of loyalty to President Trump, as GOP voters in Florida pick a candidate for governor and Arizona Republicans for Senate. And in Florida and Arizona, Democrats have competitive contests for governor.

Here’s what to watch Tuesday:

Florida: A Trump test in the East

The Florida GOP gubernatorial primary has Mr. Trump’s fingerprints all over it. Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, a well-funded Republican backed by the state party establishment, had been the clear front runner for months.

Then Mr. Trump weighed in and endorsed his rival, GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis. That catapulted the congressman to a double-digit lead in most polls.

If Mr. DeSantis wins, it will be a measure of what works in the Trump GOP, and how it has changed from the pre-Trump GOP.

Mr. DeSantis is a Fox News celebrity (appearing 93 times in less than a year, more than any other elected official), a member of the House’s hard-line Freedom Caucus, and relentless cheerleader for the president. Mr. Putnam has a blue chip resume of government service and political success, and he has out-raised and out-organized his rival.

All polls point to a DeSantis victory, though some surveys showed the race was getting close as primary day approached. If Mr. Putnam pulls out a come-from-behind victory, it will be a blow to Mr. Trump’s political prestige.

Arizona: A Trump fest in the West

A three-way race for Arizona’s Republican Senate nomination has, like GOP contests elsewhere, evolved into a Trump loyalty test. All three candidates promise to “Make America Great Again.” One local columnist called them the “MAGA triplets.”

The Senate primary election pits the establishment favorite, Rep. Martha McSally, who is backed by the Chamber of Commerce and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, against two lesser-funded rivals who are aiming to appeal to the party’s far-right wing.

Polls suggest Ms. McSally is most likely to beat former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who spent her last weekend accusing Sen. John McCain of ending his cancer treatment to stunt her political progress. Mr. McCain died on Saturday. Ms. McSally is also favored over former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who last year received a pardon from Mr. Trump. Mr. Arpaio had been convicted of contempt of court after disobeying a federal court order to halt immigration raids. Mr. Trump hasn’t endorsed anyone in the race.

Ms. McSally kept her distance from Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and has refused to say whether she voted for him. In her Senate campaign, she has portrayed herself as a loyal Trump ally, a move that is a testament to the president’s popularity among GOP primary voters.

That could make it harder for the GOP nominee to tack to the center against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who, in the absence of a serious primary challenge, has spent the last 18 months fundraising. She has collected $10.7 million to Ms. McSally’s $7.7 million.

Ms. Ward has raised $3 million and Mr. Arpaio just $1.3 million.

Another left vs. center battle in Florida

Democrats have been consistent in 2018 primaries. When given comparable options, they choose women over men, and in toss-up races, the mainstream candidates have beaten those aligned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a liberal independent.

Those trends augur good things for former Rep. Gwen Graham, who is the polling leader in Florida’s Democratic primary for governor. Close behind her are two mayors: Philip Levine of Miami Beach and Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee.

Ms. Graham is campaigning as a steward of her father’s political legacy. Bob Graham, the former governor and senator, was a fixture in the state, serving in elected statewide office from 1979 to 2005. The younger Graham features her father in many of her TV advertisements.

Mr. Levine, who grew wealthy through cruise-ship marketing companies, has spent $22 million of his own funds to back his campaign. He has run as a staunch advocate for stricter gun-control regulations.

Mr. Gillum has tied himself to the party’s Sanders wing. His final TV ad of the race flashes on the screen an array of slogans including “healthcare for all,” “ban assault weapons,” “abolish & replace ICE,” and “impeach Trump,” which would be well beyond the purview of Florida’s statehouse.

Also running are billionaire Palm Beach investor Jeff Greene, who self-financed his $30 million campaign, and Chris King, the CEO of an Orlando real estate firm.

There are 36 governors' races this year. Republicans will have to defend 26 of them and Democrats nine. And there is one independent governor. The WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why these races should be getting more attention. Photo: Getty

Don’t call it a comeback

Two former Democratic members of Congress—Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona and Alan Grayson of Florida—are trying to return to Washington but under very different circumstances.

Ms. Kirkpatrick, a former gun-rights champion, has reinvented herself as a gun-control advocate and is the front-runner for the southern Arizona House seat once held by Gabrielle Giffords.

She faces Matt Heinz, a physician who is making his third run for Congress. Mr. Heinz has tried holding Ms. Kirkpatrick’s NRA-friendly past against her, but he’s been vastly outspent by Ms. Kirkpatrick and her allies with EMILY’S List.

The seat is being vacated by Ms. McSally, the GOP front runner in the Senate primary. The winner of Tuesday’s Democratic primary will likely face Republican Lea Marquez Peterson, the head of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The Cook Political Report rates the seat, which backed Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump in 2016, as “lean Democratic.”

Mr. Grayson, meanwhile, is trying to win back his safely Democratic seat from Rep. Darren Soto, who won it in 2016 when Mr. Grayson ran for Senate and lost in the primary by 40 percentage points.

Few in Florida’s political class are thrilled to see Mr. Grayson’s return, but his brand of populist Democratic politics has proven popular in the Orlando-area district in the past.

Oklahoma: the latest battle of outsider vs. experience

Oklahoma will be the latest test of an outsider message for Republican primary voters as they pick a candidate for governor.

Former Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett faces mortgage executive Kevin Stitt in a primary runoff that has split over whether voters want a candidate with political experience. Mr. Trump hasn’t endorsed either man in the race.

Mr. Cornett touted his tenure leading the state’s largest city while blasting Mr. Stitt for running a business whose Georgia license was revoked by state regulators and who hadn’t voted in past GOP primaries.

Mr. Stitt, in his TV advertising, accused Mr. Cornett of being insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump. Mr. Stitt says in his ads that he will “help President Trump build the wall,” even though such a wall would be hundreds of miles from Oklahoma.

Mr. Cornett responded with a memorable ad calling Mr. Stitt’s attacks “Bull Stitt.”

The winner will be a heavy favorite against Democratic nominee Drew Edmondson, a former state attorney general.

"Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort pleaded guilty Friday to two criminal charges and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors investigating links to Russian election interference, developments that could add momentum to special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.

Mr. Manafort, who becomes the fifth associate of President Trump to plead guilty in connection with the Mueller investigation, admitted to conspiracy against the U.S. and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He already was convicted last month by a federal jury in Virginia of not reporting to tax authorities more than $16 million he earned for political consulting work in Ukraine in the early 2010s.

Friday’s plea agreement heads off a second criminal trial for Mr. Manafort that was to begin next week. That trial, in Washington, D.C., was set to cover additional charges related to that Ukraine work.

In connection with the agreement, Mr. Manafort agreed to forfeit four of his multimillion-dollar homes, including a Brooklyn townhome and an estate on Long Island, and funds in multiple bank accounts. Other terms of the deal couldn’t immediately be determined.

The cooperation agreement raises the legal and political pressure on Mr. Trump less than two months before midterm elections that will decide control of Congress. His former campaign chairman and his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, are now both cooperating with a prosecutor tasked with probing whether Trump associates aided what the U.S. has said was an influence campaign by Russian interests designed to help Mr. Trump win in 2016. Mr. Mueller is also looking into whether Mr. Trump sought to obstruct justice by firing Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey in May 2017, while the FBI’s Russia probe was under way.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Friday that the Manafort case “had absolutely nothing to do” with Mr. Trump or the 2016 campaign. Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for the president, said in a statement that Mr. Trump “did nothing wrong.”

Mr. Manafort had previously resisted any notion of cooperating with Mr. Mueller, and his lawyer said at the outset of the Virginia trial that there was no chance of such cooperation. Mr. Manafort, 69 years old, has been in jail since June, after he was accused of trying to influence the testimony of a potential witness against him.

In the coming Washington case, Mr. Manafort was to have faced charges of conspiring against the U.S., conspiring to launder money, failing to register his foreign lobbying work, misleading the government about that work, and obstruction of justice.

The Virginia trial, which concluded recently, involved days of detailed testimony regarding Mr. Manafort’s finances from people who had worked with and for him. The testimony often delved into embarrassing testimony about Mr. Manafort’s spending habits and what appeared to be a deliberate effort to mislead financial institutions, accountants and his own bookkeeper about his income and expenses.

The 12 men and women in that jury deadlocked on 10 additional counts.

Mr. Manafort’s defense team has arguing that others who engaged in the same conduct as Mr. Manafort weren’t prosecuted for similar crimes.

Unlike others charged by the special counsel, Mr. Manafort has taken something of a defiant approach about Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Mr. Trump, for his part, has repeatedly expressed public sympathy for Mr. Manafort, even at one point last month calling the ongoing Manafort trial “sad” while the jury was deliberating.

That public support of Mr. Manafort has raised questions about whether the president intends to pardon him, which Democrats and some Republicans have said would set off a political crisis because it would appear to be trying to undercut an investigation into the president himself.

A decade before he served as Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman for several months in 2016, Mr. Manafort worked for Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted and fled to Russia in 2014. The work included shaping U.S. perception of Mr. Yanukovych and his pro-Russia political party, prosecutors say. But Mr. Manafort didn’t register as an agent until June 2017, after he had already misled federal investigators about the nature of his work, the prosecutors say.

In court documents associated with his guilty plea, Mr. Manafort acknowledged that part of his work on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych included “an all out campaign to try to kill” congressional efforts to scrutinize him.

Mr. Manafort “knew it was illegal to lobby government officials and engage in public relations activities” without registering his activities with the Justice Department, according to the documents filed in association with the guilty plea.

That is a potentially important admission because more serious penalties are associated with knowingly violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

The “criminal information” document associated with the plea, which prosecutors wrote and Mr. Manafort agreed was true, asserts that a pro-Ukraine report drafted by the Skadden law firm as part of Mr. Manafort’s work cost $4 million, not the $12,000 that the parties had claimed.

Mr. Manafort also engaged two leading lobbying firms, the Podesta Group and Mercury Public Affairs, as part of his efforts on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych and his political faction. The criminal information says the firms hired by Mr. Manafort were paid at least $11 million for their efforts.

Mr. Manafort took measures “to keep the Ukraine lobbying as secret as possible,” the court document says.

For example, in May 2013 he asked lobbyists “to write and disseminate within the United States news stories that alleged that” a rival of Mr. Yanukovych “had paid for the murder of a Ukrainian official,” and he directed the lobbyists to leave “no fingerprints.”

“It is very important we have no connection,” he told the lobbyists, according to the documents.

Mr. Manafort took other steps to tarnish the image of the Yanukovych rival, Yulia Tymoshenko, by associating her in the U.S. with anti-Semitism, the court document says.

In October 2012, Mr. Manafort wrote that Jewish Americans who supported President Obama had “put pressure on the Administration to disavow Tymoshenko and support Yanukovych” because of Tymoshenko’s purported anti-Semitic associations.

Mr. Manafort also spread stories that an Obama cabinet member who had criticized Mr. Yanukovych “was supporting anti-Semitism because the official supported Tymoshenko, who in turn had formed a political alliance with a Ukraine party that espoused anti-Semitic views,” the court papers said.

He “coordinated privately with a senior Israeli government official to issue a written statement publicizing this story,” and pushed that statement to the American media, according to the document.

“I have someone pushing it on the NY Post. Bada bing bada boom,” he reportedly said, referring to the New York newspaper.

"PERAST, Montenegro—Vladimir Milinović has seen Western tourism in his Balkan village swell so much, he now knows who is likely to tip, and who will try to haggle down the €5 (nearly $6) he charges for a short boat ride.

“We like Americans because they are very generous,” said Mr. Milinović, as he navigated his motorboat to a picturesque island near the village called Our Lady of the Rocks. “If somebody tries to get a cheaper price we know they are probably French.”

So many tourists are descending on Europe this summer—drawn in part by the strong dollar—that a growing number are looking beyond the continent’s famous destinations, leaving hardly a spot on the map unvisited. As the lines stretch longer outside Notre-Dame in Paris, and the crush gets greater on Saint Mark’s Square in Venice, even tiny Montenegro is enjoying its place in the sun.

In well-trodden Europe, you can’t get much more off the beaten track than this Balkan country smaller than Connecticut, whose pristine beaches and landscape were relatively obscure until recently.

Conditions could hardly be better for Europe, which takes the lion’s share of global tourism revenues globally. The rising dollar and strong U.S. economy are drawing more Americans here. Russians have begun to travel again in Europe, especially in the Balkans, after a hiatus for Russia’s economic downturn. And the growing number of Chinese who visit Europe are staying longer, venturing beyond whistle-stop tours to delve more deeply into the continent’s culture offerings.

International overnight stays in Europe rose 7% in the first four months of 2018 compared with the same period last year, building on what the United Nations’ tourism organization called a “remarkable” 8% increase in 2017. Above all, Europe’s continuing economic upswing has led to strongly rising tourism within the continent, especially from Germany. Tourism industry executives expect the good times to continue.

The sector’s boom began several years ago, spurred by Europe’s emergence from its financial crisis, and has proved largely impervious to Europe’s other woes, from the migration crisis to terrorism.

With Europe remaining one of the world’s safest and most politically stable regions, destinations such as Spain and Greece have benefited from people’s security fears about vacationing in the Middle East and North Africa. Even European cities that suffered terrorist attacks in recent years, such as Paris in 2015 and Brussels in 2016, saw temporary dips in tourism before bouncing back within about a year and joining the wider boom.

The trend of tourists seeking out locations that were once considered second tier is evident even in Spain, whose 82 million foreign guests in 2017 made it the world’s second-most visited country after France. In the first half of this year, foreign tourists in Spain’s 11 least-visited regions, including the Basque Country, were about one-third higher than in the same period in 2016, while visitors to Andalusia and the Canary Islands, two of the country’s top destinations, were up a more modest 12% and 7%, respectively, in that time.

The boom is bringing back fond memories for Montenegro. It was a popular destination for Yugoslavs, but it didn’t see many foreign guests for a long time after Communism fell. Last year, 1 million tourists visited this country of 650,000 inhabitants, according to the national statistics office, a 19% rise from the year before. In the first four months of 2018, numbers were up another 20% on the year.

Tourism generated about €1 billion for Montenegro in 2017, a third of the country’s gross domestic product. In Europe, only Croatia has faster tourism growth.

Caleb Wang, a 20-year-old history student at the University of Chicago, said it never would have even occurred to him to visit Montenegro. But he ended up in the medieval town of Kotor, near Perast, on a cruise with his parents that left from Venice and followed the Croatian and Montenegrin coasts.

“I’d heard Croatia was beautiful, but I didn’t expect Montenegro would be this nice,” said Mr. Wang. “You can see why tourism is booming here.”

Montenegro is scrambling to build and refurbish hotels and improve its roads. Kotor plans to renovate the 1,350 stone steps, many in a parlous state, that lead steeply up to its formidable fortress.

The only road through Kotor, a Unesco World Heritage site with about 2,500 inhabitants that gets up to 15,000 tourists a day in high summer, is often jammed with traffic. On a recent sunny day, the old town was awash with visitors from a cruise ship.

When the first cruise ship docked at Kotor just over a decade ago, the town celebrated, and the event made the national evening television news. Now an average of a ship a day stops here. One day this August, four ships queued for a berth.

“People ask me what’s wrong if there isn’t a tour ship docked,” said Ana Nives Radović, the town’s tourism director. “The number of tourists here is still acceptable,” she said. But if there is another decade of such growth, “it might start getting out of hand.”

"WASHINGTON—The U.S. threatened to slap sanctions on countries that don’t cut oil imports from Iran to “zero” by Nov. 4, part of the Trump administration’s push to further isolate Tehran both politically and economically, a senior U.S. State Department official said.

Buyers of Iranian crude had expected the U.S. would allow them time to reduce their oil imports over a much longer period, by issuing sanctions waivers for nations that made significant efforts to cut their purchases. That expectation was partly based on previous comments from top Trump officials, as well as the Obama administration’s earlier effort to wean the world off Iranian oil over several years.

But the senior State Department official said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s administration doesn’t plan to issue any waivers and would instead be asking other Middle Eastern crude exporters over the coming days to ensure oil supply to global markets.

The tactic is likely to further escalate geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and other nations as the Trump administration pits itself against its allies and other major economies over its nearly unilateral policy toward Iran and a host of challenges on trade.

Oil prices immediately jumped on the news, with West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery ending 3.6% higher at $70.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That marked the highest level since May, when the White House said it would pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear accord—which the U.S. and other major countries reached with Tehran to curb its nuclear development—and would reimpose crushing sanctions on one of the world’s largest oil suppliers.

“We will certainly be requesting that their oil imports go to zero without question by Nov. 4th,” the official said of other countries’ purchases of Iranian oil. While the administration won’t rule out issuing sanctions waivers in the future, the official said, its predisposition is: “No, we’re not going to do waivers.”

“We view this as one of our top national-security priorities,” the official said.

The move is likely designed to spur greater global compliance with U.S. sanctions. Most major importers of Iranian crude have balked at Washington’s new economic offensive against Tehran.

Two weeks ago, Andrew Peek, deputy assistant secretary of State for Iran and Iraq, said the U.S. was prepared to issue waivers if countries made major reductions in Iran oil imports. “It needs to be significant but will probably vary from country to country,” he said then.

Top administration officials from the State and Treasury departments have jetted around the world in recent days to persuade other countries to cut use of Iranian crude and warn them that any companies, banks or traders that handle Iranian oil face U.S. penalties, including the risk of being frozen out of U.S. markets. The senior State Department official said allies in Europe and Asia already had been warned, and trips to China, India and Turkey were in the works.

Governments are being cautioned that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the White House “aren’t kidding about this,” the official said. China and India, two of the largest buyers of Iranian crude, “will be subject to the same sanctions that everybody else is if they engage in those sectors of the economy.”

The Trump administration, in pulling out of the nuclear accord and reimposing economywide sanctions on Iran that hit not just the oil sector, but also the banking, shipping, trade and insurance markets, said it wants to force Tehran to radically overhaul its nuclear and military posture in the region.

Banks’ reluctance to deal with Iran is already taking its toll on Tehran’s oil exports. Exports have fallen to an average of 2.2 million barrels a day this month, compared with 2.7 million barrels a day in May, according to data from London-based consulting firm Vortexa. Earlier this month, Indian Oil Corp. , the country’s largest refiner, said it was considering cutting Iran crude imports after a decision by government-run State Bank of India to stop dealing with Tehran.

European refiners, which buy around a third of Iran’s oil exports, are also dropping out. Italy’s Saras is considering no longer buying Iranian oil because its banks don’t want to finance such trades even before the Nov. 4 deadline, according to company officials. The company said last week it had made no final decision. European refiners say they have already started buying more oil from Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iraq to make up for upcoming reductions in Iranian oil.

Meanwhile, economic woes have triggered a new round of protests in Iran, posing a challenge to President Hassan Rouhani’s government as it struggles to tackle persistent double-digit inflation and unemployment. Economic concerns in the country have been aggravated by the Trump administration’s exit from the 2015 nuclear accord.

Mr. Pompeo warned last month that Tehran would face “the strongest sanctions in history” if it didn’t yield to U.S. demands that it temper its nuclear and regional ambitions. He also suggested the Iranian public could take matters into its own hands.

The administration’s more aggressive stance on sanctions could bolster its leverage over Tehran, but it also complicates the White House’s other diplomatic and political priorities.

The move puts particular pressure on major trans-Atlantic allies that import hefty amounts of crude from Iran at a time when Mr. Trump is ratcheting up tensions with European nations over trade and seeking their support for his North Korea pressure campaign and other foreign-policy goals.

European officials said in recent weeks they expected oil imports would have to start gradually falling after the November deadline, giving them time to explore how to keep Iran in the nuclear deal and prevent it from resuming its nuclear activities.

Tuesday’s announcement could deflate those hopes. “This is really unhelpful and part of an escalation plan. We strongly disagree with this plan,” a senior European diplomat said.

Many in Europe had been hoping the administration might continue the Obama-era practice of giving sanction waivers for 20% reductions in imports.

Another senior European official cautioned that the U.S. policy may turn out to be more bark than bite, particularly as Washington will likely struggle to persuade other countries to accede to their demands on such a sensitive issue as energy imports. “They will not succeed,” the person said.

Separately, European officials have said they would try to maintain banking channels to ensure continued trade and investment, including energy imports, though many analysts question whether they will be able to do so.

In Asia, the U.S. is relying on China to help it keep pressure on North Korea by cutting the financial and economic ties vital to Pyongyang. Some analysts say China’s government will likely keep importing Iranian crude, banking on Washington’s desire for its cooperation on North Korea.

And as the administration’s Iran policy risks pushing up oil prices as the U.S. heads into elections this year, the White House could face its own domestic political backlash.

The more aggressive policy could push oil prices past $85 a barrel by the third quarter of the year, said Frank Verrastro, a top energy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

While oil from other suppliers can fit the refining specifications set for Iranian crude and Russia and other major producers have signaled they will increase output, other production squeezes could exacerbate the upward price pressure sanctions are putting on markets.

Mr. Verrastro said the International Energy Agency was too optimistic in its recent estimate that the world has around 3.5 million barrels a day of spare production capacity that could offset Iran’s 2.4 million in daily exports. That assumes nearly all of the spare capacity currently offline in Saudi Arabia and other major exporters could come back online and run smoothly, he said, noting that hurricanes, labor strikes, technical problems and political turmoil often tighten the spigot on global oil supplies.

“I would guess they reassess in November, when prices are rising heading into the election season,” Mr. Verrastro said.

"MOSCOW—Russia’s military intervention in Syria has turned it into a significant player across the Middle East once again.

But what does this really mean?

Is Russia, as some American allies (and officials) fear, close to displacing the massive influence that the U.S. has exercised over the region for decades?

Or is it simply being drawn into the quagmire of Middle Eastern intrigues, used by regional powers for their own interests—and garnering little strategic benefit for its efforts?

A look at the region provides a complex picture. While Moscow’s relationships are deepening, its influence is still nowhere near matching Washington’s.

None of the Middle East nations that aligned themselves with the U.S. and the West have changed camp since the Arab Spring’s turbulence hit the region in 2011.

Russia’s intervention to rescue its historic ally, the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad, came only after another historic Moscow ally, Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi, was ousted and killed following a NATO military campaign in support of Libyan rebels. Gone with Ghadhafi were billions of dollars in contracts awarded to Russian enterprises.

Yet, Russia has managed to nurture relationships with traditional Western allies that were hostile to Moscow in Soviet times, including Turkey, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. That carries some economic benefits—but provides Moscow with only limited political gains.

“Nobody is pushing America out of the Middle East, it’s just pulling out by itself and leaving a vacuum behind,” said Alexey Khlebnikov, a fellow at the Russian International Affairs Council, a state-run think tank. “Russia has no real allies in the region, just partners with which it can do business despite political disagreements on many issues. Russia is not an alternative to them, it’s just a way to diversify their portfolio of relations.”

That diversification is made easier by the fact that President Donald Trump’s administration doesn’t seem to mind Russia’s new prominence in the Middle East.

“For most countries in the region, ties with Russia represent just an insurance policy—and, because the U.S. is not showing any displeasure over this and isn’t trying to kick Russia out, it’s now a zero-cost insurance policy,” said Robin Mills, CEO of Qamar Energy, a Dubai-based consultancy and advisory firm.

Today’s Russia, despite its military abilities and its sophisticated diplomatic and intelligence networks, doesn’t really have the means to project power across the region: its midsize economy is roughly the size of Australia’s or Spain’s.

And, unlike the Soviet Union, which inserted itself in Middle Eastern conflicts as a way to promote the Communist ideology during the Cold War confrontation, modern Russia has no alternative social and economic model to spread.

“Russia is in new conditions because we don’t provide ideological support to some kind of left-wing, communist forces,” said Mikhail Bogdanov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister who oversees the Middle East and Africa. “That is all in the past. We act based on rational considerations because cooperation must be mutually beneficial…. But at the same time, we stand for respecting the sovereignty of those nations.”

A frequently heard refrain in the Middle East is that Russia—unlike the U.S.—has proved that it backs its allies, no matter how unsavory they may be. By contrast, the U.S. under President Barack Obama embraced the 2011 protests that ousted such longstanding American allies (and autocrats) as President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia.

Even many of those Arabs who hold little love for Syria’s Mr. Assad confess admiration for how Mr. Putin didn’t hesitate to use military force to prevent a similar downfall of the Syrian regime.

“Egyptians see Putin as someone who’s a statesman that stands by his friends, someone who doesn’t let them down the way the Americans did with Mubarak,” said Anwar E. Sadat, a prominent opposition politician and a nephew of Egypt’s late President Anwar Sadat. “At the same time, the American president is making everyone confused about what he really wants.”

This admiration for Mr. Putin and widespread perplexity about the Trump administration don’t necessarily translate into a policy shift toward Moscow, Mr. Sadat added.

“Russia has nothing to deliver,” he said. “The Russians know that our strategic relationship with America is vital and will always be there. I don’t think there is a big future to Egyptian-Russian relations.”

If anything, regional countries such as Egypt and Turkey are using Russia—and actual or threatened purchases of Russian weapons—as leverage to improve their negotiating position where it still really matters: in Washington.

“Many countries in the Middle East are making limited investments in their relationship with Russia just so that they can use it with their allies such as the U.S., telling them—give us this or that, or we will ask Russia,” said Yuri Barmin, a Russian security consultant working in the Middle East. “But Russia is an imaginary alternative. The optical effect here is much larger than the substance. All these countries understand perfectly well how limited Russia’s influence really is.”

"Idlib and its surrounding countryside is the last major rebel stronghold in Syria, and the fight for the province will likely be the last large battle of the more than seven-year war. President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to recapture the entire country, and although small pockets of Islamic State militants are still able to mount an insurgency, Mr. Assad’s forces can claim a near-complete victory against the armed opposition if they capture Idlib.

Control of Idlib province, which lies on the border with Turkey, allows access to the M5 highway, a vital economic thoroughfare that runs all the way from the Turkish border through the main Syrian cities of Aleppo and Damascus, and links to Latakia on the Mediterranean coast.

For international powers, primarily Russia and Turkey, Idlib is one of the last opportunities to deepen or preserve their influence in Syria as the country moves into a postwar phase.

What are the potential consequences for civilians in Idlib?

United Nations officials warn an offensive in Idlib could result in the worst humanitarian disaster of the 21st century. In previous battles, for smaller opposition pockets in Daraa and East Ghouta, the Syrian government has besieged rebel-held areas to force militants into submission, with civilians suffering from hunger and lack of medicine.

Idlib is home to an estimated three million people, nearly half of whom have already been displaced from elsewhere in the country. Hundreds of thousands of the displaced still live in tents. The U.N. estimates that a million children live in the area, and that as many as 800,000 civilians might be displaced as a result of the fighting. Some 30,000 have already fled the government’s artillery attacks and Russian airstrikes. Turkey, which is home to more than three million refugees, has said that it wouldn’t open its border to those fleeing Idlib.

How likely is a direct armed conflict between Russia and Turkey?

Turkey mans 12 observation posts in Idlib and has troops north of the province, while the Russian air force is supporting Syrian government forces.

Yet an armed confrontation between the two militaries appears unlikely at this stage. Since 2015, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has drifted away from his European and U.S. allies, and developed closer ties with his Iranian and Russian counterparts. For Russia, maintaining good relations with Ankara helps drive a wedge into the NATO alliance. Direct conflict would prove costly for both sides, and endanger a burgeoning alliance.

If the regime takes Idlib, is that the end to the internal opposition to Assad?

Even though pockets of Syria remain outside of the government’s control, losing Idlib would be a devastating blow for the opposition. Idlib is the last bastion for the public uprising, which sparked the Syrian conflict in 2011. As war raged across the country, the opposition in Idlib attempted to establish a freer state, setting up local councils, media outlets, civic organizations and schools. They held local elections in the face of fierce opposition from the radical Islamists who are now designated terrorists by the West and the Assad regime alike. If the opposition in Idlib is crushed, so is a promising, albeit limited, democratic experiment for Syria. The exiled Syrian opposition is widely regarded as too weak to pose an alternative to the Assad regime.

What can the U.S. or the U.N. do?

The U.S. can do little to prevent the offensive, and has signaled that its priority in Syria is battling Islamic State in the eastern part of the country and limiting Iranian influence, not intervening in Idlib. Yet, the U.S. and its allies have warned that they will target Syrian government forces if they use chemical weapons, as international experts have accused them of doing numerous times throughout the war. These strikes would merely target the government’s capacity to use chemical weapons, not its capacity to carry out a conventional war.

On Friday, the U.N. will lead talks in Geneva on drafting a new Syrian constitution, but that diplomatic track has so far failed to have any impact, and isn’t attended by the Syrian government, nor its foreign backers. The U.N.’s impact is also limited by Russia’s veto at the Security Council. Although the U.N’s Syria envoy hopes to merge the U.N. process with the so-called Astana talks between Turkey, Russia and Iran, at this point, the U.N.’s influence on events in Syria is limited.",world
"OTTAWA—Tim Keenan is making plans to pass along his fifth-generation Quebec dairy business to his children, more than two decades after buying it from his father. There is one complicating factor: Trade talks between the U.S. and Canada threaten to upend the industry.

Canadian dairy farmers depend on a nearly 50-year-old system for protecting domestic production. The protections are viewed as sacrosanct by the main political parties, which have historically feared losing rural votes in Quebec and Ontario, the two biggest provinces and home to nearly all of Canada’s 10,500 dairy farms.

There are signs that is starting to change.

President Trump has called Canada’s dairy protections a “disgrace,” and his top aides warn they are now an obstacle in reaching a deal on a revised North American Free Trade Agreement before a late September deadline. The president has taken aim at Canada’s high tariffs on some foreign dairy products, ranging from 200% to 300%, which kick in if import volumes surpass quota thresholds.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has vowed to defend the dairy protections, known here as supply management. He has also hinted at concessions, a potentially high-stakes move for a leader facing a tight election race in just over a year.

“Is there room for flexibility? I mean, we will see and that depends on the kinds of negotiations that we have,” Mr. Trudeau said earlier this month.

Canadians appear amenable to this approach, with certain caveats. An Angus Reid Institute poll last year showed most Canadians are open to discussing changes to dairy policy, and an August poll indicated Canadians are split on terminating the regime altogether, but would lean toward this option if farmers are fairly compensated.

Canada has made concessions before. It agreed to give other Pacific Rim nations access equal to 3.25% of its annual milk production in this year’s Trans-Pacific Partnership deal. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the trade pact in 2017. Separately, Canada’s trade deal with the European Union in 2016 allows for a doubling of European cheese exports, equal to more than 4% of the Canadian market, but left intact the supply-management system.

Canada’s dairy industry is worth six billion Canadian dollars ($4.62 billion) in farm sales and another C$15 billion at the food-processing level, according to the Canadian government. Overall, that is a fraction of Canada’s C$1.8 trillion economy.

And the number of dairy farms in Canada has declined sharply over the past decade, to more than 10,000 from nearly 20,000 at the turn of the century. For context, the state of Wisconsin has almost as many dairy farms as all of Canada.

Yet dairy tends to get a disproportionate focus from politicians. The protections tend to pit a well-organized dairy lobby in Ottawa and provincial capitals versus think tanks and maverick politicians who believe the system has outlived its usefulness.

“There are very few dairy farmers left, but the image, for politicians, is one of big numbers still,” said Martha Hall Findlay, a former Canadian Liberal lawmaker and now head of the Canada West Foundation think tank. She has become an outspoken critic of the dairy system, arguing it stifles competition and forces consumers to pay higher prices for staples like milk and butter.

Under the regime, the country limits the production of dairy products by distributing quotas, which dictate how much farmers are allowed to sell domestically and sets fixed prices for farm sales. The goal, proponents say, is to avoid overproduction and the wild price fluctuations that often hit other commodities. The system also imposes tariffs on dairy imports above specific thresholds to limit foreign competition.

After the U.S. and Mexico announced a trade deal, Canada and the U.S. resumed efforts to come to an agreement. WSJ's Shelby Holliday looks at some sticking points.

Bruce Muirhead, an expert on Canada’s supply-management system and a history professor at the University of Waterloo, said the limits have helped stabilize the market and kept farmers here from contributing to a global dairy glut.

“We are not part of the problem, in fact we are part of the solution to the whole issue of oversupply,” Mr. Muirhead said. U.S. farmers are struggling, he said, because they produce too much dairy, not because their access to Canada’s market is limited.

A price difference can be seen at retailers on either side of the Niagara River. Big Baspa Mini Mart in Buffalo, New York, sells milk at $1.99 a quart. Stanley Variety in Niagara Falls, Ontario, sells a liter of milk—which is slightly larger than a quart—for C$2.99, or $2.30.

A spokeswoman for the Dairy Farmers of Canada, a lobby group, said it is unclear what concessions Canada is considering in the Nafta talks. The group contends concessions made in recent trade deals threaten to cost the industry up to C$350 million in lost sales.

Mr. Keenan, the dairy farmer, said he is watching Nafta talks closely, with an eye toward what they might mean for the family farm. Canada’s dairy system, he said, has allowed his family to plan for the future because they know what their incomes will be each year.

“It depends how much borders are opened up” in the talks, he said. “Certainly it will impact our bottom line, and the future of the dairy industry.”

"WASHINGTON—As Hurricane Florence was forming in the Atlantic, senior Trump administration officials considered replacing the head of Federal Emergency Management Agency amid allegations that he misused resources traveling to his home in North Carolina, according to people familiar with the matter.

FEMA Administrator Brock Long is the target of an internal investigation looking into frequent travel between the nation’s capital and his home in Hickory, N.C., according to people briefed on the probe. The investigation included surveilling Mr. Long as he was driven 400 miles each way on his commute, the people said.

Investigators have told administration officials that Mr. Long, while under surveillance, often left agency headquarters on Thursdays and traveled home with a caravan of federal workers, who stayed in nearby hotels for the long weekend, the people said. He has spent about 150 days in North Carolina since he took over the job last year, which included weekends and time-off, the people said.

Mr. Long declined, through a spokeswoman, to comment on Friday. He has previously denied any wrongdoing and he didn’t attend a pair of FEMA news conferences Friday afternoon about the storm.

The White House has begun discussing potential replacements for Mr. Long, a senior White House official said.

At a media briefing on Thursday, Mr. Long said he “would never intentionally run a program incorrectly” and pledged to cooperate with the investigation, and that he and the agency were “100% focused” on the approaching storm. “That’s exactly where our attention needs to be from the standpoint of the life safety mission,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security inspector general is also reviewing communications between Mr. Long and a FEMA contractor that appear to include discussions about future employment, said one of the people briefed on the investigation. Investigators are also looking into an accident involving an SUV, owned by the federal government and used to transport the director, that wasn’t property reported, the person said.

Mr. Long was informed last fall by DHS attorneys and the inspector general that his trips home violated the law, the people said. The inspector general’s office has told administration officials that they tailed Mr. Long’s caravan to determine whether he was using federal resources to return home despite the warnings, the person briefed on the investigation said.

The inspector general’s final report is expected in the coming days, but preliminary findings have been shared with DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, administration officials said. The existence of the investigation was first reported by Politico on Thursday.

Ms. Nielsen brought details of the preliminary findings to Mr. Long and urged him to resign if the allegations were accurate, one administration official said. Another official familiar with the situation disputed that the secretary made that suggestion to Mr. Long.

A DHS spokesman declined to address the allegations, referring questions to the inspector general’s office. The inspector general’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment.

“At this time, we are fully focused on preparing for, responding to, and recovering from Hurricane Florence and the storms in the Pacific,” DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton said in a statement. “The secretary is confident in the leadership at FEMA and their proven disaster management ability.”

Senior White House officials discussed replacing Mr. Long in the past several days, according to one person familiar with the matter. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly ultimately decided to leave Mr. Long in place until the final report was available, the person said. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.

President Trump has been meeting with Mr. Long regularly in recent days as Hurricane Florence prompted flooding and heavy rains on the Southeast coast. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump praised his FEMA director as someone “who’s done so well for us” during storms that hit Texas and Florida last year.

Inside FEMA, Mr. Long is well liked. Several FEMA officials said privately that they felt conflicted about reports of his travel.

One FEMA official said Friday the administrator has national-security duties, and the use of government vehicles supports that effort and allows for him to ensure classified communication. The official also said that in previous administrations, using vehicles in a similar fashion was routine practice. Officials were working to resolve any discrepancies in the use of specialized vehicles and federal laws, the official said.

Mr. Long joined the administration when Ms. Nielsen was chief of staff at DHS and Mr. Kelly was the secretary. Previously, Mr. Long was an executive at Hagerty Consulting, an Illinois-based emergency-management consulting firm with offices in Washington. Mr. Long also ran the Alabama Emergency Management Agency and was an emergency-management official in Georgia. He also has previously worked at FEMA.

Mr. Long is the latest Trump administration official to face questions about improper use of federal resources while traveling.

Scott Pruitt, the former EPA administrator, resigned in July amid allegations of ethical lapses and improper spending, including $163,000 on first-class flights, military aircraft and charter flights. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned last September over his extensive use of private jets and military flights.

"AL-KHOKHA, Yemen—The United Arab Emirates paints its battle for the Yemen port city of Hodeidah as pivotal to forcing Houthi rebels to negotiate an end to the three-year war. It is also the biggest test yet of the U.A.E.’s growing military reputation.

But the U.A.E. has now suspended the advance after confronting land mines, drones, snipers and humanitarian challenges, prolonging a drawn-out campaign in a broad contest for regional domination that pits the Emirates, Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Muslim Arab nations against Shiite-dominated Iran.

The U.A.E., working on the ground with Emirati-trained Yemeni brigades, wants the port out of Houthi hands as soon as possible, saying it generates up to $40 million a month for the Houthi government that rules over the Yemeni capital, San’a.

The brigades are regrouping amid political talks aimed at averting what aid groups warn would be a catastrophe if food and medical supplies can’t move through the port.

For the battle-hardened thousands of Yemeni forces advancing from the south, however, land mines—many of them encased in fiberglass and painted to look like rocks—have been the most difficult problem.

“Land mines are destroying our tanks and vehicles,” said Brig. Gen. Sheikh Abdel Rahman al-Laji, the commander of the third brigade of the Giant Brigades, one of the coalition-aligned Yemeni forces fighting in Hodeidah.

Frequent Houthi attacks along the windswept, largely barren coastal road to Hodeidah, passing through al-Khokha, where the U.A.E. maintains a forward base, have presented another challenge.

Iran, Gulf Arab officials allege, has long used Hodeidah’s port to ship weapons to the Houthis. They accuse Iran of nurturing the group as a proxy akin to Hezbollah in Lebanon or Shiite militias in Iraq that Tehran supports monetarily and militarily. United Nations experts have determined that some of the ballistic missiles that the Houthis use to harass Saudi Arabia originated in Iran.

Iran denies arming the Houthis. There are no Iranian military personnel known to be in Yemen, as there are in Syria.

Some Western officials said they suspect Tehran’s military assistance to the Houthis is intended to draw Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. into a costly conflict.

The U.A.E. is one of the smallest nations in the region but one with the biggest military ambitions. With an active-duty military of just 63,000, the U.A.E. has rapidly expanded its footprint across the Arabian Peninsula and eastern Africa. It has a string of bases in Somalia and Eritrea and along the Yemen coast. In 2016, Emirati-backed forces defeated al Qaeda in the southern Yemen city of Al Mukalla.

While Saudi Arabia is leading the coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen, the U.A.E. is managing the Hodeidah battle. The U.A.E. sees Hodeidah as a potential milestone that will shift the momentum of a protracted conflict; it is also a test of the country’s ability to train, equip and deploy local forces to achieve its military goals.

Hodeidah “is the largest combat operation the U.A.E. has ever coordinated anywhere in the world,” Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has studied the U.A.E.’s military development closely. “This is the sort of thing people thought only the Americans can do.”

After more than three years of fighting, the coalition and its Yemeni allies have gained territory but nothing close to full victory. More than 10,000 people have died in fighting, according to the U.N. More than three million have fled their homes, including over 120,000 as a result of the Hodeidah battle, the U.N. says; over 22 million—about four out of five people in Yemen—are in need of aid.

The Hodeidah port serves as the gateway for about three-quarters of Yemen’s aid and almost all of its commercial food shipments. U.A.E. officials said a slow advance gives Hodeidah’s 400,000 inhabitants the best chance of survival, with a step-by-step operation that allows the city’s port to stay open and receive aid, with pauses to allow for diplomatic efforts toward a peaceful Houthi withdrawal.

Aid groups have pleaded with the coalition not to assault the city, and the U.S. has given only tepid support to its ally’s plan, in large part because of the danger to human life.

The coalition hopes its staged conduct of the operation will alleviate some of those concerns, while allowing more time for peace talks conducted by the U.N.’s Yemen envoy, Martin Griffiths.

The U.A.E. has 50,000 metric tons of food aid ready to be brought into the city, the U.A.E.’s foreign ministry told the U.N. last month. The Emiratis are arranging minesweepers, cranes and other equipment to repair the port after its capture.

That goal has been delayed, however, as the Houthi fighters have been able to scatter to avoid airstrikes and their snipers have hidden in Yemeni farmland to attack coalition forces.

They have also deployed drones to spy on and attack coalition-aligned forces. While the Yemeni forces were able to shoot down some drones, others succeed in dropping explosives that led to casualties and damaged equipment.

“We have been fighting them for a long time,” said Gen. Abdel Rahman, the U.A.E.-allied Yemeni military commander. “But this is the first time they’ve used such weapons.”

Gen. Abdel Rahman also said that as his forces reached the outskirts of Hodeidah, Houthi fighters positioned themselves in civilian areas and put military vehicles within the grounds of hospitals and in residential areas.

Loai al-Shami, a Houthi spokesman, said the coalition was the side putting civilians in danger by trying to take over the airport and seaport of the city. “When they failed to capture them and inflicted heavy casualties, they alleged that they slowed it down because of civilians,” he said.

Coalition forces captured the airport last month, but Houthi-run media have since shown Houthi forces again in control of parts of the facility.

A coalition spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment about the situation at the airport.

Mr. Shami said the Houthis had slowed the coalition’s advance by cutting its supply routes and surprising coalition forces with drone and rocket attacks.

Video distributed by Houthi media this month showed drones carrying out surveillance and dropping bomblets on positions on the Red Sea coast. One of the drones appeared to be a scaled-down variant of an Iranian drone that coalition forces have intercepted in the past.

"WASHINGTON—Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, acknowledged new details on Friday about his work on behalf of a former Ukrainian president—and his efforts to keep that work secret—as he pleaded guilty to criminal charges arising from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

In court documents associated with his guilty plea, Mr. Manafort said his work for Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian president who was ousted before fleeing to Russia in 2014, included “an all-out campaign to try to kill” congressional efforts to criticize his client.

A key part of Mr. Manafort’s effort, according to the documents, was working with former European leaders to lobby U.S. policy makers. The prominent Europeans, whom Mr. Manafort referred to as the Hapsburg Group, lobbied members of Congress and the administration without disclosing that they were being paid by Ukraine.

In a June 2012 “eyes only” memo, Mr. Manafort said the goal was to “assemble a small group of high-level” European officials who could act “informally and without any visible relationship with the government of Ukraine.”

The group included a former Austrian chancellor, Italian prime minister, and Polish president. In memos to Mr. Yanukovych included in the court documents Friday, Mr. Manafort mentions having “organized and leveraged” visits to Washington by former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and former Italian Prime Minister Roman Prodi, who he says also signed op-eds casting Ukraine as an “important global strategic partner to the U.S.” Mr. Manafort also makes repeated references to a third member of the group called “AG,” an apparent reference to former Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer.

The plea agreement says Mr. Manafort arranged for the former European officials to be paid more than €2 million ($2.3 million) from 2012 to 2014.

In the fall of 2012, at Mr. Manafort’s behest, members of the Hapsburg Group contacted U.S. senators to lobby them to stall a resolution critical of Mr. Yanukovych’s treatment of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, his political rival. The effort ultimately failed, and the Senate approved the resolution.

Starting in 2006, Mr. Manafort and his associate Richard Gates—who pleaded guilty earlier this year to charges related to the Ukraine work and was a witness for prosecutors in Mr. Manafort’s first trial—engaged in a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign for Mr. Yanukovych, who was seeking to burnish his image as a Europe-oriented leader despite close ties to Moscow.

To help with their Ukraine work, Mr. Manafort hired a half-dozen lobbying and law firms in Washington, including the Podesta Group, Mercury LLC and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. The court documents say the firms hired by Mr. Manafort were paid a total of at least $11 million for their efforts.

Mr. Manafort took measures to conceal his client’s role in the lobbying efforts. “It is very important we have no connection,” he told his lobbyists in 2013, according to the documents. He told the Washington lobbying firms he hired to report that the lobbying work was being funded and directed by the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, which the documents note “was not even operational” when the companies began lobbying for Ukraine.

Employees at the firms acknowledged privately whom they were working for, the court documents indicate. The head of Podesta Group—the company’s founder, Tony Podesta, who isn’t named in the documents—advised his team to “think the President of Ukraine ‘is the client,’” the documents say, while another Podesta Group employee referred to the Centre in an email as the “European hot dog stand for a Modern Ukraine.” A Mercury employee told another company employee that the lobbying for the Centre was “in name only” and added: “You’ve gotta see through the nonsense of that…It’s like Alice in Wonderland.”

Mr. Mueller referred investigations related to those firms to the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. A former Skadden associate was prosecuted by Mr. Mueller’s office for lying to investigators and served a one-month sentence in jail. No Podesta or Mercury associates have been publicly charged.

Representatives for Skadden, Mercury and the Podesta Group, which folded last year, haven’t responded to requests for comment.

The documents also name Mr. Manafort’s Ukrainian business associate, Konstantin Kilimnik, who was previously charged with conspiring with Mr. Manafort to obstruct justice by trying to sway the testimony of two potential witnesses in the Mueller probe. Mr. Kilimnik isn’t in custody and is believed to be overseas.

Messrs. Manafort and Kilimnik made 21 contacts or attempted contacts with the witnesses between late February and early April this year, according to the court documents filed Friday.

A few weeks before the 2016 election, Mr. Gates told another business associate, Alex van der Zwaan, that Mr. Kilimnik was “a former Russian intelligence officer,” according to a previous court memo.

"WASHINGTON—House Republicans have pulled out of talks with Democrats to ban the use of hacked or stolen information in campaigns, leading Democrats on Friday to pledge themselves to “not participate, aid or encourage hackers or foreign actors in any attempt to influence American elections.”

The two parties’ House congressional campaign committees had been in discussions since June and were nearing a deal, according to aides. The unprecedented agreement would have seen both committees pledge to not use stolen or hacked material as candidates and incumbents campaign this fall.

That comes after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian actors interfered in the 2016 election, including by hacking into the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee servers and posting information online about competitive House races.

The National Republican Congressional Committee and the House GOP super PAC used material obtained by a hacker in 2016 in ads.

On Friday, Republicans said they withdrew from the deal after Democrats broke an agreement to not discuss the negotiations publicly until a pact was sealed.

“I feel bad that those negotiations broke down, but in the end, negotiations are about trust,” National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Steve Stivers told reporters Friday at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. “When the chair of the DCCC talked to the media earlier this week, it was kind of the straw that broke the camel’s back on trust.”

New Mexico Rep. Ben Ray Luján, who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that he was hopeful an agreement could come together this week. Democrats scoffed that Mr. Luján’s interview was the reason for Republicans’ decision to walk away. A National Republican Congressional Committee aide familiar with the talks said Democrats had set an “arbitrary deadline.”

“We have negotiated with the NRCC in good faith in an effort to release this pledge jointly, but the time for delays and excuses has run out,” Mr. Luján said in a statement Friday.

Newsletter Sign-up

Mr. Stivers had objected to committing to not using information that becomes public and is reported.

“Once something’s in the public domain I’m not sure if you can say, ‘Everybody let’s just ignore it,’ ” he said in June, adding that he wouldn’t stop candidates who were citing something that is “in the public if it’s out there.”

He said on Friday that Republicans are “not seeking stolen or hacked material” and “have no intention of using stolen or hacked material.”

The DCCC pledged to not use stolen or hacked information or promote it to the media “regardless of the source.”

Senior intelligence officials describe Russia interference in the 2018 midterm elections as deep, real and ongoing. Candidates have reported hacking attempts to their campaigns and political accounts, though a successful hack hasn’t been reported.

Hackers also published embarrassing information about Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic candidate for president, which was widely reported and circulated. Moscow denies it interfered in the election.

"New York Republicans on Thursday tapped political newcomer and Manhattan attorney Keith Wofford as their candidate for state attorney general at the party’s nominating convention.

The Republican candidate is running for the position formerly held by Eric Schneiderman, the state’s former top legal officer who resigned earlier this month following allegations of assault, which he denies.

Mr. Wofford, the first African-American Republican nominee for attorney general, is considered the underdog in the general election matchup. Republicans have failed to win a statewide race since 2002, and the last GOP attorney general left office in 1998. Democrats also expect a big turnout with their base eager to voice displeasure with President Donald Trump.

“Voters are going to recognize that any machine candidate will lack credibility to clean up collusion and corruption in the government,” said Mr. Wofford, who has never run for public office, in an interview. “It’s not about party affiliation. It’s about who can do the job.”

Republicans said Mr. Schneiderman’s scandal presents the party with a rare opportunity for a statewide win.

“Three weeks ago the political world was shocked by the news of disgraced Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s resignation,” said Nicholas Langworthy, chairman of the Erie County Republican Party. “It was a celebratory day in the Republican Party.”

Mr. Wofford beat out a crowded field of candidates for the GOP nod, including Thomas Humbach, an attorney from Rockland County; and Randy Elf, an attorney from Chautauqua County. But his closest rival was Joe Holland, an attorney and a minister who grew up in Auburn, N.Y.

Mr. Holland, who received 33% of the Republican delegate votes to Mr. Wofford’s 63%, endorsed his rival and declined to challenge him in a primary.

“This is a time for our party to unify,” Mr. Holland said.

New York Democrats on Wednesday nominated New York City Public Advocate Letitia James as their candidate for attorney general, who is the favorite to win the general election in November in the Democratic-dominated state.

When asked for comment on Mr. Wofford’s nomination, Geoff Berman, the executive director of the New York Democratic Party, said “Who?”

“Tish James, who was my neighborhood city councilwoman in Brooklyn and is a great public advocate for New York City, will be an outstanding attorney general for New York State,” Mr. Berman said.

Zephyr Teachout, a law professor and former gubernatorial candidate who lost the 2014 primary to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and Leecia Eve, a Verizon executive, have also said they would petition for a spot on the Democratic primary ballot.

Mr. Wofford, a Buffalo, N.Y., native, earned his bachelor’s degree from Harvard College and his law degree from Harvard Law School. He is co-managing partner at law firm Ropes & Gray.

At the convention, Republicans railed against political corruption in Albany and said Mr. Wofford is well equipped to take that on.

“For too long New Yorkers have been fleeced by bad politicians in Albany,” said Broome County Republican Chairman Bijoy Datta. “It has to end.”

Fundraising will be a challenge for Mr. Wofford, who is still assembling a campaign staff and beginning the fundraising process. Mr. Schneiderman had raised nearly $7 million by July 2014 during his last election run.

“Based on my conversations, I expect good support from folks around the state who want to see better, cheaper and more honest government for the taxpayers of New York,” Mr. Wofford said.

"Michael O’Hanlon is right to be concerned that large-scale military exercises can be misinterpreted by the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of [North] Korea). The solution to this problem is good communication between the U.S. and ROK (Republic of [South] Korea) governments and the DPRK and Chinese governments (“A Better Way to Prepare for War in Korea,” op-ed, Sept. 5).

Forces defending the ROK need to hold large-scale, land-forces exercises to practice how they would have to maneuver to repel an invasion from the larger army of the DPRK. Organization of the forces to repel an invasion would be above the brigade level. Maneuvering at the division, corps and army levels are skills that need to be practiced if they are to be available in time of need. ROK forces have the size to do the job (aiming for 38 active and reserve divisions in a reorganization under way) but they need to practice realistically. U.S. forces need to practice with them, and we need to practice moving and integrating reinforcements from outside the Korean Peninsula.

These types of exercises are expensive but necessary to maintaining those skills. The fact that the U.S. Army infrequently conducts large-scale land-forces exercises doesn’t mean that the ROK should emulate them. The DPRK knows how effective these exercises are and that is the reason they want them stopped.

"Pierz, Minn.

Amid a parade of firetrucks, Model Ts and Shriners driving go-karts, Pete Stauber is running—literally—for Congress. As the procession rolls through this town of 1,350 during Pierz Oktoberfest (held, naturally, at the end of August), Mr. Stauber, 52, has to jog to keep up. That’s because he so frequently stops to shake a hand, to explain he’s the Republican candidate in the Eighth Congressional District, and to add that he hopes he has your vote.

The final finish line on Nov. 6 is weeks away, but Mr. Stauber appears in good political shape given that Northeast Minnesota is historically Democratic territory. The Eighth District includes the Great Lakes’ busiest port, Duluth, as well as the state’s Iron Range, where thousands still work mining and processing taconite ore. In 70 years, the GOP candidate has won here only once.

What may change that is Donald Trump. The district’s center of gravity has shifted slightly in recent decades, as Duluth lost population and the Twin Cities suburbs crawled further up the map. Still, Northeast Minnesota went for Mr. Trump by 16 points in 2016 after President Obama won it by 6 in 2012, one of the largest swings in the country.

Now the president’s blue-collar appeal is helping make the congressional seat competitive, at least for a certain kind of Republican. Mr. Stauber, a retired Duluth police officer, was at one point the president of his union, Local 363, and he opposes right-to-work laws. He backs President Trump’s 25% steel tariffs to the hilt. “The Chinese steel dumping should have been dealt with decades ago,” he says. “It devastated our Iron Range and our mining industry.” The splash photo on Mr. Stauber’s website shows him riding with Mr. Trump in “The Beast,” the presidential limo, before a June rally in Duluth attended by 8,000.

When Mr. Stauber jumped into the race last summer, he expected to face an incumbent Democrat, Rep. Rick Nolan. Then in February the congressman announced he would retire. Instead the Democratic candidate is Joe Radinovich, 32, a onetime state lawmaker who managed Mr. Nolan’s last campaign and worked as the Minneapolis mayor’s chief of staff.

One point of contention, splitting Democrats, is a pair of proposals to mine copper and nickel in Superior National Forest. The Obama administration, in its waning days, moved to block mining within about 365 square miles. “It was purely political,” Mr. Stauber says, “and it was the biggest assault on our way of life.” When President Trump came to town, he pledged to reverse the ban. Mr. Radinovich, who defeated explicitly antimining Democrats in the primary, has said he thinks the work can go on without hurting the environment. But he seems much more comfortable talking up Medicare for all.

A poll this week puts Mr. Radinovich in the lead, 44% to 43%, well within the margin of error. Politics aside, Mr. Stauber has a compelling story: He once played minor-league hockey and then minded four kids while his wife deployed to Iraq with the Air National Guard. If any part of blue Minnesota is open to a Trump Republican, it’s the Iron Range..

In the state as a whole, however, Mr. Trump’s approval since Inauguration Day has dropped 17 points. This is a problem for Republicans in places like the Second District, anchored in the suburbs south of the Twin Cities. Though it’s a somewhat purple area, Republicans had held the seat tightly since 2002. The GOP contender in 2016, Jason Lewis, was expected to flame out, given incendiary comments from his 20-year career in talk radio. Critics dubbed him “mini-Trump.” He won by 1.8 points. But that year’s ballot also featured a perennial candidate on the populist left, running under the Independence Party, who took 8%.

Mr. Lewis has worked to build a legislative record. He wrote bipartisan bills on criminal-justice reform and is pushing a legislative amendment to force the Twin Cities’ regional government, the appointed Metropolitan Council, to have at least one elected member. “They’re raising taxes and spending all their money on very expensive light-rail lines,” Mr. Lewis says. “We don’t have the density for that sort of transit, and yet what suffers is roads in the Second District.” He defends a disputed plan to replace parts of the Enbridge Pipeline, which feeds oil to the state’s largest refinery: “I think it’s good policy. I think it’s safer than truck or rail, so I’m all in favor of it.”

Yet old tape from his talk-radio days continues to surface. In July, CNN posted a clip from 2012. “It used to be that women were held to a little bit of a higher standard,” Mr. Lewis mused. “Now are we beyond those days, where a woman can behave as a slut, but you can’t call her a slut?” Last month BuzzFeed quoted a 2013 show on which Mr. Lewis argued that if courts ruled gay marriage to be covered by the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, it would “undo the entire state criminal code”—because, among other examples, “when we pass a law against rape, you’re not treating a rapist equal.”

Mr. Lewis’s stock defense is that he was paid to be provocative. He insists such comments don’t reflect the Jason Lewis voters recall listening to all those years. Is more tape forthcoming? “Who knows?” he says. “Personally, I don’t care, because I don’t think it’s going to work. It’s too clever by half. But who knows who’s got what?” Radio stations, he explains, don’t keep long archives, and neither does he. “Once you leave their employment—zzzip—they erase it. So I don’t have the show,” he says. “You realize how much server space I’d have to have for 20 years of radio?”

The Democratic candidate, Angie Craig, is the same one Mr. Lewis beat in 2016. A former HR executive at a company that made pacemakers, she was raised in Arkansas and still has a hint of Southern accent. So far, her soft-focus ads center on family life with her wife and four sons. And if, as November nears, the Democrats want to talk about talk radio?

Mr. Lewis is defiant. “I’d rather talk about Enbridge Pipeline, about the Met Council, about a rising tide of economic growth,” he says. “If they want to dig up old radio clips, and they think they can win a congressional seat that way, let ’em do it.”

"President Xi Jinping declared last year that modern China’s principal contradiction is between unbalanced, inadequate development and “the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life.” Hong Kongers can point to a different dichotomy: increasing economic development at the cost of ever-shrinking political freedom.

Hong Kong’s West Kowloon Terminus opens Sept. 23, when high-speed bullet trains will shoot through the first rail tunnel connecting Hong Kong and mainland China. The now two-hour trip to Guangzhou will take 48 minutes. The project promises to transform travel within South China’s Pearl River Delta, an economic powerhouse central planners hope can rival San Francisco’s Bay Area.

But a novel customs co-location arrangement within the station lays Hong Kong’s political autonomy across the tracks. One quarter of the massive terminus will be leased by Hong Kong authorities to their mainland counterparts to allow passengers to pass through both immigration portals in one station. Hong Kong officials say that’s necessary to fulfill the project’s economic potential; otherwise, passengers would have to hop off and on again when the train crosses the border.

But mainland officials won’t merely be granted immigration authority in their corner of Kowloon. They will enjoy a range of powers, the argument goes, to prevent the terminus from becoming a hideout for fugitives from the mainland. Authorities 15 miles from the border will have the power to enforce Chinese law.

The prospect of mainland officers in Hong Kong is unsettling, but the bigger concern is Beijing’s legal waffling over why this doesn’t contravene the city’s Basic Law, a miniconstitution meant to guarantee Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy as a “special administrative region.” Article 18 states that domestic Chinese law won’t apply to Hong Kong. Beijing claims the terminus is excluded because its scope is limited—Hong Kongers don’t have to use the station if they don’t want to.

The Hong Kong Bar Association argues this reasoning “completely bypasses and emasculates” Article 18, because “the fact that a law may not have immediate practical consequences for a person unless they step into a particular arena does not mean that the law does not apply to all persons.” Such an argument renders the Basic Law “irreparably breached,” the association said in December. And by Beijing’s logic, why couldn’t jurisdiction over Hong Kong be carved up until more city blocks follow mainland statutes than Basic Law?

The joint checkpoint will be challenged in Hong Kong court this October, but there’s almost no chance Beijing will tolerate judicial scrutiny of a policy already approved by its highest legislative body. Mainland legal scholar Tian Feilong dismissed the review’s prospects in the South China Morning Post, writing that the Hong Kong judiciary’s primary purpose is “maintaining order under the Basic Law without compromising the sovereignty, security, and developmental interests of the state.”

For years, the question hanging over Hong Kong hasn’t been whether its degree of autonomy will diminish, but how. The joint checkpoint—and its justification—shows how the Basic Law could be hollowed out under the guise of maintaining public order and promoting economic development.

"NEW BERN, N.C.—Florence continued to drench the Carolinas Saturday as it lumbered across the region, claiming at least six lives and stranding hundreds of people in floodwaters.

The storm, which made landfall near Wrightsville Beach, N.C., on Friday morning, moved at a 2-mile-an-hour crawl over eastern South Carolina on Saturday, producing severe flooding, according to the National Hurricane Center. It is forecast to soak the Carolinas throughout the weekend, dumping as much as 40 inches of rain along the coast south of Cape Hatteras. The deluge triggered “catastrophic flash flooding” and significant river flooding, the hurricane center said.

At least six people have died in storm conditions in the region, according to authorities. In North Carolina, the deaths include two people killed in Lenoir County, and a mother and infant killed in Wilmington, N.C., when a tree fell on a home, according to authorities. A woman in Pender County also died when a fallen tree prevented emergency crews from reaching her while she suffered a heart attack, a county spokeswoman said.

‘The rainfall is epic, and will continue to be. We face walls of water, at our coast, along our rivers, across farmland, in our cities and in our towns.’ —North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper

The first storm-related death reported in South Carolina occurred Friday night, when a 61-year-old woman driving on a highway near Union crashed into a toppled tree.

More than 810,000 people lacked power in North Carolina, and another 170,000 outages were reported in South Carolina, according to emergency-management agencies. More than 28,000 people were staying in 220 shelters in the Carolinas.

“The rainfall is epic, and will continue to be,” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper at a news conference Saturday morning. “We face walls of water, at our coast, along our rivers, across farmland, in our cities and in our towns.”

Mr. Cooper said dangers from flooding were increasing, with some rivers not expected to crest until early next week. “The water is rising fast everywhere, even in places that don’t typically flood,” he said. “Many people who think that the storm has missed them have yet to see its threat.”

James Trogdon, the state’s transportation secretary, said numerous counties had primary roads closed, and portions of interstate highways were shut. Interstate 40 was closed north of Wilmington, as was Interstate 95 near Fayetteville, because of flooding.

Federal officials said Saturday that while Florence had weakened, its dangers had not. “What we’re dealing with here is a major flooding and rain event. At this point, we’re also looking at potential landslides,” said Neil Jacobs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at a news conference.

Jeffrey Byard, associate director at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Florence would be costly, in part because of the sheer volume of water it is unleashing and its slow movement.

The National Hurricane Center downgraded Florence to a tropical storm on Friday and expected to further downgrade it to a tropical depression by Saturday night. But the center continued to warn about the threat of water. It predicted dangerous storm surges of as much as 5 feet along the Carolina coastline.

President Trump approved a major disaster declaration for North Carolina on Saturday, freeing up federal funding for affected areas. He is expected to travel to areas affected by the hurricane next week, the White House said Friday.

To help with power outages, utility companies staged nearly 40,000 workers from 17 states on the outskirts of the storm, waiting until it is safe enough to move in. Utility poles were piled up alongside Interstate 95 to replace those snapped by winds and debris.

Between one million and three million power outages are expected, warned Duke EnergyCorp., the large power provider based in Charlotte, N.C. It warned that the hardest-hit communities could wait weeks for the power to come back on.

The Southeast’s big industries battened down. Meat companies including Tyson Foods Inc . , Smithfield Foods Inc., Pilgrim’s Pride Corp . and Wayne Farms LLC shut down operations from Pennsylvania to North Carolina. While some meat processors shifted production to plants outside the storm’s path, in other cases processing was put on hold altogether. Farmers worked to protect livestock and waste lagoons from heavy rains, and travel ground to a halt.

The disruption in North Carolina—the second-largest pork producing state, with nearly as many hogs as human residents—meant about 135,000 fewer hogs were slaughtered than forecast earlier in the week, according to Archer Financial Services, helping to boost wholesale pork prices.

The projected rainfall could present a problem for the power industry’s 26 coal-ash ponds in the Carolinas. Utilities were monitoring these facilities, which store toxic waste from coal-burning power plants. A heavy rain that caused the ponds to overflow could create an environmental catastrophe.

Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at weather.us, said the storm will dump approximately 10 trillion gallons of water on North Carolina, about a quarter of the annual total. That is roughly double the rainfall from Hurricane Matthew in 2016, he said. He estimated a total of 18 trillion gallons will fall on all affected states.

If the current forecasts hold, many regions could see “a flood of biblical proportions,” said Rick Neuherz, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service. “This could be our Harvey.”

New Bern, N.C., quickly became a trouble spot as floodwaters rose. Along the Neuse River, emergency responders pulled off some 200 rescues overnight and Friday morning, and about 150 people were still awaiting help, city spokeswoman Colleen Roberts said. The entire area had lost electricity, and some people were in chest-deep water while others retreated to attics, she said.

"Patient and advocacy groups filed a lawsuit Friday seeking to block the Trump administration’s plan to let people buy less-expensive health insurance that doesn’t comply with the Affordable Care Act.

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, takes aim at one of the central planks of the administration’s plan to roll back the Obama-era health law, after Congress failed to repeal it last year. It sets the stage for a legal standoff that could affect coverage and premiums for millions of Americans in 2019.

The Trump administration rule finalized in August loosens restrictions on a type of coverage known as short-term medical insurance—low-cost plans that cover a limited period with less-expansive benefit offerings, which are subject to fewer consumer protection regulations. The plans don’t have to cover people with pre-existing conditions, and insurers can charge higher premiums based on a consumer’s health status.

The lawsuit filed by organizations including the American Psychiatric Association and AIDS United argues that the rule runs contrary to the ACA and will harm patients by resulting in higher costs for those with medical conditions.

“The only practical difference between these plans and comprehensive insurance, then, is that they need not comply with the ACA’s protection requirements and can cherry pick healthier consumers—the precise practice prohibited by the ACA,” according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit was filed against Health and Human Services, the Treasury Department, and the Labor Department, their agency heads, and the Justice Department.

In a statement, HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said the plans “are an important option for people in certain circumstances, and the Trump administration is committed to delivering greater access to more affordable choices to the men and women left out by Obamacare.”

The Justice Department declined to comment. The Treasury Department and Labor Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The plan to allow for a proliferation of less robust but cheaper health plans sold on the individual insurance market has been widely expected to siphon off younger, healthier people who now buy coverage on the ACA’s exchanges. Health analysts have said that will cause insurers to raise premiums on the exchanges because younger, healthier consumers are needed to offset the costs of older, sicker, and more expensive individuals.

The result, they have said, will be a two-tiered market for people who buy their own coverage and don’t get it from federal programs or employers —with higher costs for those with pre-existing health issues. They have also said the plans will leave some consumers with huge costs if they develop a medical condition that isn’t covered.

The Trump administration and Republicans, however, have praised the rule as a way to provide relief to people who don’t get subsidies to offset premium costs on the exchanges. Costs have risen sharply for these individuals, and Republicans largely say insurance-coverage requirements imposed by the ACA are to blame.

The lawsuit is the latest in a spate of litigation that seeks to block changes that will weaken the health law.

Lawsuits have also been filed against new requirements in Kentucky and Arkansas that mandate many Medicaid recipients work and participate in community service to retain or get benefits. In July, a dozen attorneys general filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration from expanding access to a type of association health plan that doesn’t comply with all the ACA consumer protections.

Democratic attorneys general also have intervened in a case from 20 Republican states seeking to have the ACA knocked down entirely. Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh on Thursday filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Maryland against the Trump administration, saying it is sabotaging the ACA and that the law is constitutional.

“Together with the lawsuit filed by Maryland yesterday, this filing demonstrates that ACA supporters are willing and able to take the same aggressive litigation approach that opponents have taken in the past,” said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. “No act by the Trump administration to undermine the ACA will go unchallenged.”

"WASHINGTON—The Trump administration has ordered State Department officials in China to take a tougher approach to visa applications by Chinese citizens, according to a person familiar with the policy, the latest move in long-running tensions between the two countries over trade and other economic issues.

The fresh guidance for consular officers in China could result in shorter visas for some Chinese students and longer delays for some Chinese business visa applicants, this person said. A State Department official declined to comment on the details but said any changes would take effect June 11.

The new measures target students studying robotics, aviation and high-tech fields, according to the Associated Press, which first reported the story.

The orders are consistent with Mr. Trump’s national security strategy, which focuses heavily on trade practices and restricting access to American technology and identifies China and Russia as threats to U.S. power. A 67-page strategy document, unveiled in December, listed tighter visa procedures for suspected intelligence agents, including students.

The administration also is confronting China on trade. Officials said this week that by mid-June they would unveil a final list of $50 billion in imports from China that would be subject to tariffs unsettling negotiations between the two sides to reach a deal on trade.

The State Department official said most student applicants receive a visa that lasts the maximum five years. That, the official said, “is unchanged,” declining to comment on the business visas or specific types of student visas.

In China, a growing number of students who have been accepted at U.S. universities have already started reporting that visa applications have been delayed amid lengthier processing times.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, commenting on the new guidance on Wednesday, said that both China and the U.S. needed to make more efforts to facilitate people-to-people exchanges, which she called “very important” in a range of sectors.

“Visa facilitation is something that is reciprocal,” she said. “We believe that it serves the interests of both sides.”

Chinese professionals and students said stricter measures were unlikely to put off applicants for now. Gloria Chyou, the Beijing-based co-founder of InitialView, which helps Chinese students submit video interviews as part of their applications, said her team hasn’t seen a drop in applicants.

Students now seeking to study in the U.S. have been preparing for years and already heavily invested. In the longer run, however, stricter controls may put off middling students and reduce the appeal of America’s top universities.

“Before, U.S. was the gold standard, that’s where everyone wants to go,” Ms. Chyou said. “But in the past six months especially, people are like, what about Canada? What about Australia?”

One student at Beijing’s prestigious Peking University who has been accepted at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore to begin a Ph.D. in computer science this fall said he wasn’t fazed by the news.

“It’s really inconvenient, but I’ll still go,” he said. Even if in the future, he had to reapply for a visa every year to study in the U.S., he’d still be willing, saying that for his particular area of interest—artificial intelligence—other countries weren’t as attractive.

“But then again, Canada also has some good schools that I might think about,” he said. He declined to give his name, saying that he’d applied for his U.S. visa earlier this month and had not yet been approved.

"NEW BERN, N.C.—Florence started its slow march across the Southeast Friday, pounding North Carolina with rain, forcing hundreds of people to be rescued from floodwaters and claiming at least five lives.

The storm, which made landfall near Wrightsville Beach, N.C., at about 7:15 a.m., began what could be a dayslong deluge in the region, with rain forecast to potentially reach 40 inches in some areas. About 750,000 people were without power and about 210,000 were staying in 170 shelters in the Carolinas. The storm made landfall just 2 miles from where it was expected and it remains to be seen if its impact is as forecasters fear.

At least five people have died in storm conditions in the state, according to authorities. The deaths include two people killed in Lenoir County, and a mother and infant killed in Wilmington, N.C., when a tree fell on a home, according to North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper’s office. A woman in Pender County also died when a fallen tree prevented emergency crews from reaching her while she suffered a heart attack, a county spokeswoman said.

Entire communities could be “wiped away” by historic flooding, Mr. Cooper said Friday. “The storm is going to continue its violent grind across our state for days.”

“We’re all kind of waiting. There’s a little bit of apprehension as you can imagine,” said Major Mark Craddock with the Salvation Army of Cape Fear, who was hunkered down with about 30 others at the organization’s shelter in downtown Wilmington, about three blocks from the Cape Fear River.

The National Hurricane Center downgraded Florence to a tropical storm due to its slow wind speed Friday afternoon but didn’t change its warnings of storm surges, flooding and heavy rainfall.

President Trump is expected to travel to areas affected by the hurricane next week, the White House said Friday.

To help with power outages, utility companies staged nearly 40,000 workers from 17 states on the outskirts of the storm, waiting until it is safe enough to move in. Utility poles were piled up alongside Interstate 95 to replace those snapped by winds and debris.

Powerless As of Saturday evening, nearly 9 percent of the more than 5 million customers served by major electricity providers in the Carolinas remained without power. Percent reporting power outages 12% 10 8 6 4 7:00 a.m. Friday Hurricane Florence makes landfall 2 Midnight Friday Noon Noon Midnight Saturday

Between one million and three million power outages are expected, warned Duke Energy Corp. , the large power provider based in Charlotte, N.C. It warned that the hardest-hit communities could wait weeks for the power to come back on.

The Southeast’s big industries battened down. Meat companies including Tyson Foods Inc., Smithfield Foods Inc., Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. and Wayne Farms LLC shut down operations from Pennsylvania to North Carolina and Virginia. While some meat processors shifted production to plants outside the storm’s path, in other cases processing was put on hold altogether. Farmers worked to protect livestock and waste lagoons from heavy rains, and travel ground to a halt.

The disruption in North Carolina—the second-largest pork producing state, with nearly as many hogs as human residents—meant about 135,000 fewer hogs were slaughtered than forecast earlier in the week, according to Archer Financial Services, helping to boost wholesale pork prices.

The projected rainfall could present a problem for the power industry’s 26 coal-ash ponds in the Carolinas. Utilities were monitoring these facilities, which store toxic waste from coal-burning power plants. A heavy rain that caused the ponds to overflow could create an environmental catastrophe.

Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at weather.us, said the storm will dump approximately 10 trillion gallons of water on North Carolina, about a quarter of the annual total. That’s roughly double the rainfall from Hurricane Matthew in 2016, he said. He estimated a total of 18 trillion gallons will fall on all affected states.

If the current forecasts hold, many regions could see “a flood of biblical proportions,” said Rick Neuherz, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service. “This could be our Harvey.”

New Bern, N.C., quickly became a trouble spot as floodwaters rose. In New Bern, along the Neuse River, emergency responders pulled off some 200 rescues overnight and Friday morning, and about 150 people were still awaiting help, city spokeswoman Colleen Roberts said. The entire area had lost electricity, and some people were in chest-deep water while others retreated to attics, she said.

The area’s storm surge had reached 9 feet downtown and water was up over the tops of street signs, said Capt. Donald Gurkin with the Greenville, N.C., Fire-Rescue, who was in New Bern as part of a state task force. “Our guys are tired.”

Clara Phillips, who lives in the Brices Creek area of New Bern, sat on her screened-in back porch on Friday, watching as the wind pushed trees to and fro. Two pines had already fallen and an oak looked likely to drop on her neighbor’s home. Her front yard was littered with shingles ripped from the houses across the street.

“We have a birch that we planted two years ago that looks like it’s doing calisthenics,” she said. “It’s just touching its toes and standing up, touching its toes and standing up.”

Her neighbors, a couple and their 14-month-old son from across the street, had come to her home because their roof was leaking.

Down the coast in Jacksonville, N.C., emergency responders evacuated 62 people from a hotel early Friday morning. Portions of the hotel’s roof collapsed and cinder blocks that are part of the hotel began to crumble.

Meanwhile, by early afternoon Friday in South Carolina, tens of thousands of residents were without power in Horry County, which includes Myrtle Beach. The rest of the state braced for widespread outages and flooding.

In Florence County, officials ordered residents along Black Creek and the Lynches River to evacuate by noon Saturday, because of the risk of flooding. Early Friday afternoon, with water levels still low, residents still appeared to be in place in the area, parts of which are thickly forested and accessible only by dirt roads.

At the Hotel Florence, in the City of Florence, the bar and restaurant has become a hub for displaced locals and those fleeing the shore. Marc Kaplan and his wife, Becky Kaplan, have been camped out at the hotel since leaving their home in coastal Little River, S.C., a mandatory evacuation zone, on Wednesday.

“You have to take each one of these storms as they come at you,” said Ms. Kaplan, who said this was the first time they’d evacuated in more than two decades. “This one was all over the place.”

Near the landfall site in Wrightsville Beach, N.C., Mayor Bill Blair said he found little damage on his initial end-to-end tour of the 4-mile-long barrier island on Friday morning. But by the late afternoon, ocean waves had breached the dunes and washed over roads, and some docks were completely submerged. An $11 million investment to widen the beach by about 100 yards last winter was largely washed away.

Mayor Blair said the arrival of the backside of the storm coincided with high tide, creating a massive surge of water within hours.

“When you see the movies with the tsunami pushing the water right up all at once?” he said. “It was kind of like that. It was just scary.”

"NEW DELHI—The top U.S. military commander said Saturday he is engaged in “routine dialogue” with the White House about options should the Syrian government use chemical weapons in an expected assault on the northern rebel stronghold in the province of Idlib.

President Trump “has been clear on the consequences for the use of chemical weapons,” Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters. “He expects us to have military options, and we have provided updates to him on the development of those military options,” Gen. Dunford said.

The general’s comments come amid mounting concerns that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, will launch a major offensive on Idlib, the last major enclave of opposition and extremist groups. Syria denies it has used chemical weapons, and Russia has said the U.S. is seeking a pretext for a strike against Assad regime forces.

On Friday, the leaders of Turkey, Iran and Russia held a summit in Tehran but failed to reach an agreement, with Russia and Iran rejecting Turkey’s cease-fire offer.

Turkish officials have said they oppose an offensive in Idlib, fearing a flow of refugees into their country and more instability on their southern border.

”It certainly is disappointing but perhaps not surprising that the Russians, the Turks and the Iranians weren’t able to come up with a solution,” Gen. Dunford said.

A battle for Idlib province would mark the final push by regime forces and allies against their opponents in the seven-year civil war. Thousands of rebel and jihadist group members are in the province, many of them part of an al Qaeda offshoot. There also are suspected members of Islamic State extremist group there.

The Trump administration has conducted two strikes in Syria in response to chemical attacks since April 2017. Gen. Dunford said the scope of a third strike, if necessary, would be determined by the White House and likely would be shaped by several factors. The scale and scope of any chemical attack by the regime “would inform the response,” he said.

“The decision to employ military force in response to chemical weapons hasn’t been made, but we are in a dialogue, a routine dialogue, with the president to make sure he knows where we are with regard to planning in the event that chemical weapons are used,” Gen. Dunford said.

This week, there have been a spate of airstrikes in Idlib province. In recent weeks, Syrian forces have been gathering on the province’s southern border and Russia has moved ships into the area.

"Saudi authorities on Saturday carried out a new wave of arrests, targeting royals and cabinet ministers in a crackdown against alleged corruption that comes as the Saudi leadership is seeking to consolidate power during a period of political transition.

Billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a prominent member of Saudi Arabia’s royal family and one of the world’s wealthiest men, was among at least 10 princes and more than two dozen current and former ministers detained by Saudi authorities on Saturday night, according to people familiar with the matter.

Mr. al-Waleed is a top investor in Apple Inc. and Twitter Inc. He faces charges of money laundering, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The targeting of senior princes like Mr. al-Waleed and of sitting cabinet ministers represents an escalation of a campaign of arrests launched by the Saudi leadership in recent months. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—elevated to heir apparent after his predecessor was deposed this summer—is consolidating power before his octogenarian father, King Salman, is expected to abdicate either later this year or early next year, people familiar with the matter said.

Mr. al-Waleed has long been one of Saudi Arabia’s most prominent business voices, but he hadn’t been seen as a major player in domestic politics. His father, Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud, however, has previously opposed Prince Mohammed’s rise to power.

Over the years Mr. Alwaleed was a key backer of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire, but he is no longer a significant shareholder in Wall Street Journal parent News Corp or 21st Century Fox Inc. after selling shares in recent years.

Representatives of the Saudi government and a spokeswoman for Mr. al-Waleed didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Two other prominent Saudi government officials were also detained, the people familiar with the matter said: Adel Fakieh, the economy minister, and Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, the head of the National Guard, one of three main branches of Saudi Arabia’s security forces. Both face charges of corruption.

King Salman on Saturday night issued royal orders firing the two men, without elaborating. Prince Mohammed has previously said he would go after graft at the highest level.

In September, the government arrested dozens of clerics and other public figures, some of whom had opposed Prince Mohammed’s moves toward liberalization. The government also warned Saudis that it wouldn’t tolerate criticism of its hard-line stance toward neighboring Qatar, with which it severed ties in June.

At the time, Saudi officials said the government was targeting people it suspected were involved in a nascent plot against the government.

Saturday’s arrests were carried out by a newly established anticorruption agency headed by the crown prince. The agency, formed on Saturday by a decree issued by King Salman, has far-reaching authority in cases of suspected corruption involving public funds, including the power to issue arrest warrants, to impose travel restrictions and to freeze assets.

“Laws will be applied firmly on everyone who touched public money and didn’t protect it or embezzled it, or abused their power and influence,” King Salman’s order said. “This will be applied on those big and small, and we will fear no one.”

Advertisement

The anticorruption committee marks a new effort to stamp out unscrupulous dealings in a country where the line between government money and the royal family isn’t always clear.

The crackdown comes as Saudi Arabia moves forward with an economic liberalization plan centered on the initial public offering of a piece of the state energy firm, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the largest oil producer in the world. The IPO could generate as much as $100 billion, making Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund the largest in the world and helping the kingdom invest in other areas beyond oil—a plan referred to as Vision 2030.

The arrests send a clear message that corruption won’t be tolerated as the kingdom pushes through its plan for economic reform, said Mohammed Alyahya, a Saudi political analyst and nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C.

“MBS has made it very clear that he will crack down on corruption, and that he is willing to do it from the top first,” Mr. Alyahya said, using a popular acronym for Prince Mohammed. “The bottom line is that corruption costs the government. We have economic problems…There is no way you can achieve Vision 2030 without tackling these issues.”

But the firing and arrest of Mr. Fakieh also creates a new complication for the kingdom’s economic plan, in which Mr. Fakieh had been playing a leading role.

The economic plan is already facing setbacks, such as a delay of the IPO of as much as 5% of Saudi Aramco, a centerpiece of the program.

Mr. Fakieh, who also served in the cabinet under King Salman’s predecessor, is succeeded by his deputy, Mohammed bin Mazyad al-Tuwajiri, a former banker at HSBC Holdings PLC.

Mr. Miteb was replaced at the National Guard by another, less prominent royal. Mr. Miteb is a son of the monarch’s predecessor, King Abdullah, and was one of few princes in a position of authority outside King Salman’s branch of the royal family. According to people familiar with the matter, he was among several senior princes who opposed the king’s decision in June to depose Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince in favor of Prince Mohammed.

The moves come as Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Muslim-dominated country, is fighting a war in Yemen, works to contain the influence of rival Iran, and is entangled in a political crisis involving its former ally Qatar.

Also Saturday, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, one of Saudi Arabia’s allies, stepped down from his post, saying he feared an assassination plot. Mr. Hariri blamed Iran for stoking tensions in his country.

"President Donald Trump sat down for an interview Thursday morning with four reporters from The Wall Street Journal: Rebecca Ballhaus, Michael C. Bender, Peter Nicholas and Louise Radnofsky. White House attendees included Communications Director Hope Hicks, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn.

Here is the expedited transcript of that interview. Portions of the interview were off the record, and have been excluded from this transcript.

The Wall Street Journal: Yes, actually that seems as good a place as any to start, maybe, in Davos…

President Donald Trump: Sure.

WSJ:…and if you could talk a little bit about your decision to go and the message you’re trying to send there and if you have thoughts about what you’re going to say.

Mr. Trump: Well, I think more than anything else it’s the great success that we’ve had in the last year. And you know if you remember the first quarter was a very low GDP, when Obama’s last quarter. It was the slowest growing recovery, a very minor recovery, but it’s the worst recovery they’ve had since the Great Depression. And our country was headed in the wrong direction.

The Wall Street Journal interviewed President Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday. Mr. Trump spoke about his relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and signaled openness to diplomacy with North Korea. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib gives us more insight from the interview. Photo: Getty

We were going down, we were going down a long way. I believe if the opposing party got in, I believe the stock market would have fallen 50 percent instead of gone up to the number it’s gone up. The regulations were choking people, choking companies like never before. It was out of control and they were only going to get worse.

The cutting of regulation and all of the many things that we’ve done, including being a cheerleader for the country—and perhaps that’s part of the reason I’m going to Davos also—but being a cheerleader for the country. Yesterday it was announced that Toyota is coming in with a very big plant in Alabama. It’s going to cost—they’re going to spend billions of dollars, four thousand jobs, create 300,000 cars a year within the country, which is what I want.

Prime Minister Abe told me about it, I pressed him very hard. I said, ‘We got to get your companies building here. We don’t want a building in Japan; we want to build them here. We have a lot of plants opening, car plants opening; we have a lot of things happening that would’ve never happened under the Democrats.

And I just think I want to tell the story of what’s happening in the United States. A lot of tremendous things are happening in the United States, including the fact that you can now live without being strangled by regulation. You people actually wrote one of the best stories that I’ve ever seen on regulation; you said more than any president in history.

That was the full pager, that wasn’t…

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump:…I mean I actually read it because I’ve never seen a full page—it’s actually a full page article.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: But, it was a full pager and essentially said there’s never been a president that’s been anywhere close on regulation. And you know, just so we understand. We need regulation, but we don’t need 19 different roadblocks getting to the same place and that’s what we had. And we have a long way to go, we’re cutting actually quite a bit of additional regulation. We’re looking at Dodd-Frank very strongly and I think we’ll have something on that.

I think it’s going to be bipartisan and we’re looking at other things and the bottom line is that the spirit in the country—you saw small business yesterday came out with the most enthusiastic they’ve ever been in the history of the report, which is a very old report.

Business, generally, manufacturing the same thing, but we have companies pouring back into this country and you saw that yesterday with Toyota.

WSJ: Did you see the other economy news yesterday? The markets did dip a little bit after some news suggesting that you were going to maybe pull out of Nafta. I wonder where you’re at on Nafta and if you’re concerned about the impact pulling out and renegotiating could have on the market.

Mr. Trump: I’m not sure that markets would dip; I think that markets would—I can tell you I’m not sure about world markets, but I can tell you I think the American market would go up if I terminated Nafta and renegotiated a new deal.

We are—when I campaigned I said we’ll either renegotiate Nafta or I’ll terminate it.

And nothing’s changed, I have fulfilled many of my campaign promises. One of the promises that you know is being very seriously negotiated right now is the wall and the wall will happen. And if you look—point, after point, after point—now we’ve had some turns. You always have to have flexibility. As an example, we’ve been much tougher on China, but not nearly as tough as I would be, but they are helping us a lot with North Korea.

And you see in North Korea what’s happening with North Korea all of a sudden. China’s been helping us a lot, so you can veer a little bit differently, but for the most part everything I’ve said I’ve done.

WSJ: And a question on China for you, just to follow up on Nafta, withdrawal is still on the table for you?

Mr. Trump: If we don’t make the right deal, I will terminate Nafta. OK?

Now, do I want to? No, I’d rather leave it, but I feel that if that if—you know, the United States has been treated very, very badly. That has been a terrible agreement for us, and if we don’t make a good deal for our country—we lose $71 billion in trade deficits with Mexico. We lose $17 billion with Canada. If we don’t make a fair deal for the United States and the United States taxpayer, then I will terminate it.

WSJ: Do you have a timetable on that? I know there’s another round of talks coming up here this month.

Mr. Trump: No, but, you know, I’m leaving it a little flexible because they have an election coming up. So I understand a lot of things are hard to negotiate prior to an election. They have an election coming up fairly shortly, and I understand that that makes it a little bit difficult for them, and I’m not looking to make the other side—so we’ll either make a deal or—there’s no rush, but I will say that if we don’t make a fair deal for this country, a Trump deal, then we’re not going to have—then we’re going to have a—I will terminate.

With that being said, I would rather be able to negotiate. We’ve made a lot of headway. We’re moving along nicely. Bob Lighthizer and others are working very hard, and we’ll see what happens.

But tremendous numbers of, you talk about auto plants like yesterday, but how about all the plants that have been taken out of this country and moved to Mexico. Like taking candy from a baby. No, I won’t let that happen.

WSJ: And you mentioned the link between China and North Korea. We talked about that a little bit the last time we were in here.

Mr. Trump: Right.

WSJ: Is that—does that link still exist for you? Do you feel like China’s been helpful enough...

(CROSSTALK)

Mr. Trump: Not helpful enough, but they’ve been very helpful. Let’s put it this way, they’ve done more for me than they ever have for any American president. They still haven’t done enough. But they’ve done more for me than they have, by far, for any—I have a very good relationship with President Xi. I like him. He likes me. We have a great chemistry together. He’s—China has done far more for us than they ever have for any American president. With that being said, it’s not enough. They have to do more.

WSJ: So when it comes to some of the decisions you have this month on aluminum, steel, the 301 case, does that...

(CROSSTALK)

Mr. Trump: For instance, at the very beginning, you know Obama felt—President Obama felt it was his biggest problem is North Korea. He said that openly. He said that to me, but he said that openly. It is a big problem, and they should not have left me with that problem. That should have been a problem that was solved by Obama, or Bush, or Clinton or anybody, because the longer it went, the worse, the more difficult the problem got. This should not have been a problem left on my desk, but it is, and I get things solved. And one way or the other, that problem is going to be solved.

China has been helping us, and I appreciate the help, but they can do much more.

WSJ: Are you worried, Mr. President, that sending—delaying military exercises on the peninsula for the Olympics sends the wrong message to the North?

Mr. Trump: Say it again?

WSJ: Are you concerned that delaying military exercises on the Korean Peninsula for the Olympics sends the wrong message to the North Koreans, that you’re in some way bending to them?

Mr. Trump: You’re the first one that’s asked that question. No, I don’t think anybody thinks that I’m bending. I think that people that, if anything, I’m being too tough.

No, I think it’s inappropriate to have the Olympics, have millions of people going to the Olympics hopefully, have North Korea going to the Olympics, and we’re having exercises on the beach. No, I think that it doesn’t—I think it sends a good message to North Korea, not a bad message. I think it would be totally inappropriate to do that during the Olympics.

WSJ: You think North Korea is trying to drive a wedge between the two countries, between you and President Moon?

Mr. Trump: I’ll let you know in—within the next 12 months, OK, Mike?

WSJ: Sure.

Mr. Trump: I will let you know. But if I were them I would try. But the difference is I’m president; other people aren’t. And I know more about wedges than any human being that’s ever lived, but I’ll let you know. But I’ll tell you, you know, when you talk about driving a wedge, we also have a thing called trade. And South Korea—brilliantly makes—we have a trade deficit with South Korea of $31 billion a year. That’s a pretty strong bargaining chip to me.

With that being said, President Xi has been extremely generous with what he’s said, I like him a lot. I have a great relationship with him, as you know I have a great relationship with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.

I have relationships with people, I think you people are surprised.

WSJ: Just to be clear, you haven’t spoken to the North Korean leader, I mean when you say a relationship with Korea—

Mr. Trump: I don’t want to comment on it—I don’t want to comment, I’m not saying I have or I haven’t. But I just don’t—

WSJ: Some people would see your tweets, which are sometimes combative towards Kim Jong Un...

Mr. Trump: Sure, you see that a lot with me and then all of a sudden somebody’s my best friend. I could give you 20 examples. You give me 30. I’m a very flexible person.

WSJ: Speaking of being flexible it sounds as if there’s an immigration deal that has been struck amongst senators on the hill that’s been sent to the White House for approval?

Mr. Trump: Getting close.

WSJ: Have you—have you seen anything from the Senate yet?

Mr. Trump: No but it’s getting close. They—want, I feel, you know, I have great feeling for DACA. I think that we should be able to do something with DACA. I think it’s foolish if we don’t, they’ve been here a long time, they’re no longer children, you know. People talk of them as children, I mean some are 41 years old and older. But some are in their teens, and late teens, but nevertheless I think we should do something with DACA and I think we should do something to help people.

It wasn’t their fault, their parents came in, it wasn’t their fault. So we’re in the process of trying to work something out. I hope we can do it. I don’t think it has to take that long. The lottery system is a disaster, we have to get rid of the lottery system. The—as you know chain is—chain migration is a horrible situation. You’ve seen the ads, you’ve seen everything, you know all about chain.

This person on the west side that killed eight people and badly, you heard me say yesterday, badly, badly wounded about 12. I mean people losing arms and legs—nobody even talks about that. But they say killed eight and that’s it. I mean you have people—ones walking around without—missing two legs. And the person was running to stay in shape and now he’s missing two legs. Think of it.

But this person, who should’ve never been allowed into this country, came in through the lottery. When they interviewed his neighborhood, they say he was horrible. You’d say good morning to him and he’d start cursing at you. They didn’t want him so they sent him through the lottery, you know, congratulations United States.

So the lottery has to end, chain migration—he brought in they say 22 people through the chain. So we have 22 of his relatives, why? And I honestly think that the Democrats are with us on that. We’ll find out. I mean who wouldn’t be? Who wouldn’t be? Unless it’s somebody that didn’t love our country, and the Democrats love our country. We have different views but the Democrats love our country.

So yeah, I think, Michael, I think we have a good chance to make a deal. We have to have a wall. We don’t have a wall, we’re not doing the deal.

WSJ: Do you have to have a completely funded wall or—would $1.6 billion be enough?

(CROSSTALK)

Mr. Trump: Let me, let me tell you something about the wall. So I’ve always said we have to have a wall. I’ve also said Mexico’s got to pay for it—sometimes you know on occasion, I’d add who’s going to pay for it? Mexico. Well they will pay for it, OK? There are many forms of payment. I could name 10 right now. There are many forms of payment, I didn’t say how.

WSJ: Could you give us an example?

Mr. Trump: They can pay for it through, as an example, they can pay for it indirectly through Nafta. OK? You know, we make a good deal on Nafta, say I’m going to take a small percentage of that money and it’s going to go toward the wall. Guess what? Mexico’s paying. Now Mexico may not want to make the Nafta deal and which is OK, then I’ll terminate Nafta…which I think would be frankly a positive for our country. I don’t think it’s a positive for Mexico, I don’t think it’s a positive for the world. But it’s a positive for our country because I’d make a much better deal. There is no deal that I can make on Nafta that’s as good as if I terminate Nafta and make a new deal. OK? But I feel that we have a chance of making a reasonable deal, the way it is now.

WSJ: On immigration—could you see yourself signing a bill….

Mr. Trump: The other thing…so the wall. The wall’s never meant to be 2,100 miles long. We have mountains that are far better than a wall, we have violent rivers that nobody goes near, we have areas...

But, you don’t need a wall where you have a natural barrier that’s far greater than any wall you could build, OK? Because somebody said oh, he’s going to make the wall smaller. I’m not going to make it smaller. The wall was always going to be a wall where we needed it. And there are some areas that are far greater than any wall we could build. So, maybe someday somebody could make that clear, Sarah, will you make that clear please?

I saw on television, Donald Trump is going to make the wall smaller; no, the wall’s identical. The other thing about the wall is we’ve spent a great deal of time with the Border Patrol and with the ICE agents and they know this stuff better than anybody, they’re unbelievable.

They both endorsed me, the only time they’ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate, OK? And they endorsed us unanimously. I had meetings with them, they need see-through. So, we need a form of fence or window. I said why you need that—makes so much sense? They said because we have to see who’s on the other side.

If you have a wall this thick and it’s solid concrete from ground to 32 feet high which is a high wall, much higher than people planned. You go 32 feet up and you don’t know who’s over here. You’re here, you’ve got the wall and there’s some other people here.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: If you don’t know who’s there, you’ve got a problem.

WSJ: Well, the other day after your meeting when you talked about wanting to see a deal from Congress. In particular, I’m thinking of the tweets from Ann Coulter. You know, a straight—I mean, they want a wall. Do you feel that you have some room to negotiate here with your own base, when it comes to the wall?

Mr. Trump: I don’t have to because the wall is the same wall I’ve always talked about. I can understand why I have to have see-through.

WSJ: OK.

Mr. Trump: If I’m standing here, I want to be able to see 200 yards out. I want to be able to see, I don’t want to have a piece of concrete that I can’t see.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: Now on the wall we have cameras and we have highly sophisticated equipment, but the wall—the Border Patrol tells me the other way’s more expensive. It’s not less expensive. We have to have vision through the wall.

WSJ: But…

Mr. Trump: This is going to be state of the art wall; this will be state of the art. But, I can fully understand why you’d have to have vision. I’d like to be able to see three or four hundred yards instead of we’re at a wall we have no idea who’s on the other side. Does this make sense or am I just wasting my time.

Hope Hicks: It’s what you’ve always talked; it’s consistent with what you’ve always said.

Mr. Trump: No, this is the same. I hope I don’t read tomorrow, Trump is going to make the wall, I always said, we need a wall.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: I never said the wall’s going to be two thousand, but there are—there is a vast amount of territory where nobody comes through.

WSJ: There’s this famous metaphor in politics about Nixon going to China.

Mr. Trump: Right.

WSJ: Is there a possibility that Donald Trump could sign a comprehensive immigration bill which would provide a path to legal status, citizenship for 11 million people who are here illegally?

Mr. Trump: Well, I’m not talking amnesty at all. I’m not talking amnesty at all, that’s the other thing. No, I think my base is with me. My base feels that these 800 thousand young people should not be thrown out of the country, OK? My base is with me and now I you know; and I think my base actually gets bigger.

And I’m not doing it because of the base or anything else, I’m doing it from the standpoint of heart, I’m doing it from the standpoint of common sense. I’m doing it from another standpoint too. You have a lot of people of those 800, they work hard, they have jobs. We need workers in this country; we need people to come in and work because I have a lot of companies moving in.

And I’m getting a lot of questions like we want to move to Wisconsin, we wanted—like Wisconsin, I have Foxconn coming to Wisconsin; that’s my deal. You know the head of Foxconn, you know he’s a friend of mine. He’s still only moving there because of me. And the governor has been fantastic.

The governor of Wisconsin has been fantastic in their presentations and everything else. But I’m the one who got them to look at it. Now we need people because they’re going to have thousands of people working it’s going to be a—you know—that’s—that’s the company that makes the Apple iPhone.

WSJ: Yeah.

Mr. Trump: Is that—they’re going to build them here, they’re going to build other things here too.

We need people so we have to be a little bit flexible. I don’t want to be so—I’ve had another pledge that I’m going to move companies back into this country. I don’t want to make it so tough that they can’t come back in.

Would you say that’s a correct statement, Gary, we have to have people.

Gary Cohn: Yeah.

WSJ: So when you say you have to have people, clearly there’s the 800,000 ‘Dreamers,’ but there’s also the larger group of people who are currently in the country…

Mr. Trump: That’s a different discussion.

WSJ: So, you said on Tuesday…

Mr. Trump: That’s comprehensive—well, if we could do that, that’s fine. I don’t know that that’s going to be possible.

There’s a lot of—there’s a lot of—there’s a big difference—first of all, there’s a big difference between DACA and Dreamers, OK?

Dreamers are different. And I want American kids to be Dreamers also, by the way. I want American kids to be Dreamers also.

But there’s a big difference between DACA and Dreamers. And a lot of times when I was with certain Democrats they kept using the word dreamer. I said, “Please, use the word DACA.” You know it’s a totally different word.

WSJ: Sure.

Mr. Trump: OK, people think they’re interchangeable, but they’re not.

So—I—I think we have a very good chance of making a deal on DACA, I would like to be able to do it; I think that the people that are Trump supporters agree with me on it. I would never do it without a wall, the wall is the wall and it’s the same wall that we’re always talking about. It’s—you know, wherever we need, we don’t need it where you have mountains; you don’t need it where you have rivers and—you know, vicious rivers.

So—so we have sort of natural barriers.

WSJ: Barriers, yeah.

Mr. Trump: And, obviously, we never intended (inaudible).

WSJ: Just to be really clear, because I don’t want to have any misunderstanding.

Mr. Trump: Yeah, be really clear, I’d like to—because I love The Wall Street Journal. I hope that you guys are clear. OK.

WSJ: For sure.

When—on Tuesday you said that you supported the idea of signing comprehensive immigration reform…

Mr. Trump: No, no I support the idea of discussing it.

WSJ: OK.

Mr. Trump: And, maybe, it’s possible to get it. You know, that’s what I do, I make deals. Despite what you read with—by these people that don’t know me, that were never interviewed by—to me, you know.

White House official: But first we have to (inaudible).

(CROSSTALK)

Mr. Trump: The man with the three hour interview, he spent three hours—the man who said he spent three hours in the Oval Office who I never met once in the White House. OK, you know—despite all these characters that are—that’s something you can talk about, is the libel laws, because we’ve got to increase our libel laws so when people make misstatements, like yourselves, but when people make misstatements somebody has some, you know, recourse.

WSJ: Do you have a plan for that, Mr. President?

Mr. Trump: Yeah, I do, I would—I would say—I don’t know that I’ll be able to get it though—but I think that when somebody makes false statements and libelous statements, whether it’s in a book or a newspaper or anything else. When they have phony sources, when the sources don’t exist, yeah I think they should have a liability.

WSJ: Do you think Congress needs to make new libel laws?

Mr. Trump: I don’t know if Congress has the guts to do that.

WSJ: But do you want them to?

Mr. Trump: I would like to see that. Yeah, I’d like to be able to—look, nobody gets more false press than I do. Nobody—nobody gets—nobody comes close. In history—in the history of this country nobody’s gotten more false press and you guys all know it.

WSJ: Why—why do you think that is?

Mr. Trump: They dislike me, the liberal media dislikes me. I mean I watch people—I was always the best at what I did, I was the—I was, you know, I went to the—I went to the Wharton School of Finance, did well. I went out, I—I started in Brooklyn, in a Brooklyn office with my father, I became one of the most successful real-estate developers, one of the most successful business people. I created maybe the greatest brand.

I then go into, in addition to that, part-time, like five percent a week, I open up a television show. As you know, the Apprentice on many evenings was the number one show on all of television, a tremendous success. It went on for 12 years, a tremendous success. They wanted to sign me for another three years and I said, no, I can’t do that.

That’s one of the reasons NBC hates me so much. NBC hates me so much they wanted—they were desperate to sign me for—for three more years.

WSJ: Mr. President, you made reference to the book. Steve Bannon…

Mr. Trump: Just—and so—so I was successful, successful, successful. I was always the best athlete, people don’t know that. But I was successful at everything I ever did and then I run for president, first time—first time, not three times, not six times. I ran for president first time and lo and behold, I win. And then people say oh, is he a smart person? I’m smarter than all of them put together, but they can’t admit it. They had a bad year.

WSJ: You mention the book—Steve Bannon was somebody important to your campaign, worked in the White House, was on the National Security Council for a while. Do you feel betrayed by him?

Mr. Trump: Yes, I do. I feel betrayed because you’re not supposed to do that, but I have many people that work for me who were far more important than Steve, right there.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: And others, I mean I could take you around to the back and I could show you many people, If you don’t—and some of them you wouldn’t know their names so (inaudible). Steve was—I always liked Steve, but Steve became very ineffective because he was such a lightning rod.

And Steve, in the end I fired Steve.

WSJ: Is that relationship permanently broken between you and Steve?

Mr. Trump: You never know, you know again, the word—– I don’t know what the word permanent means, OK? I never know what the word permanent means. We’ll see what happens, but Steve had nothing to do with my win. Well, certainly very little.

Steve’s greatest asset is he was able to convince a corrupt media that he was responsible for my win. Hope, just out of curiosity, you were there from day one. What do you think Steve in a percentage had to do with my victory?

I mean he was there. Corey [Lewandowski] had more to do with it.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: David had more to do with it. Many people— I mean, there were many people—it’s a little before Sarah’s time. If you were here, you would have had more to do with it. No, I talked to Steve very little; I didn’t know Steve well, believe it or not. They made it sound like—I mean when that guy wrote the book about Steve.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: Don’t forget, I had vanquished 17 governors, senators plus a couple of very smart people, like Ben and Carly and others. I had vanquished them easily—easily. I won every debate based on the polls. You know, they do polls—seven or eight polls. Time Magazine—Time Magazine’s not a fan of mine.

Drudge, Time Magazine they have seven polls. I don’t think, I may be wrong—I don’t think you’ll find one poll that I ever lost in any of the 14, 15 debates. Including the presidential debate, you know with her, the three. Steve Bannon, I just wish him well…

WSJ: Sir can I ask you—

Mr. Trump: …but he had nothing to do with my—he was involved, but he had nothing to do with our victory. And he was there two months—what was it two months after? So, I beat 17 people, OK? So, Michael, you know politics, perhaps better than me.

WSJ: Not better.

Mr. Trump: You’ve been doing it longer, OK? That’s the other thing I’ve only been doing this for two years, two and a half years, OK? You know, it’s pretty good. When they said Jeb Bush was off his game; Trump killed him in the debate. Jeb was off his game because he hasn’t been governor now. He’s been out of politics for eight years. Oh, really? I’ve been out of politics for—I was never in politics.

So, sort of interesting, but when I won against the 17 people, you can’t then say that oh, gee, somebody comes in two months after I won, and he gives me new policy, new idea. I can’t change those ideas, those ideas are wedded.

WSJ: What seemed like the most egregious thing that Steve said was that was some of the things about your son and the Russian meetings.

Mr. Trump: What he said about my son is horrible. My son had a brief meeting based on the fact that he thought whatever he thought. And he—somebody said bad stuff on an opponent. I don’t know of one politician in Washington—if you’re a politician and somebody called up that they have information on your opponent that might be negative.

I’m not sure, but I don’t think there’s one politician in all of Washington that would not take that would not take that meeting, number one. Number two, after the meeting was over nothing happened. In other words, it wasn’t like OK let’s meet again in a month and let’s plan out the—nothing happened, it was a dead meeting.

WSJ: Did you ever hear about the meeting during the campaign?

Mr. Trump: No, I never did; I never knew about it.

White House official: Excuse me, I just—we have about two or three minutes left and you’ve got to go to a meeting.

Mr. Trump: Oh I do?

White House official: Yes, you have an 11:15. So, I can push it about five minutes, but that’s all we’ve got. So you’re running out of time.

WSJ: I’d like to ask a couple of questions about your tweets on the Russia investigation.

Mr. Trump: Yes.

WSJ: You had tweeted yesterday that you wanted Republicans in Congress to take control of the investigations. They control Congress. Do you want them to shut down those investigations?

Mr. Trump: No, I think—I just want them to—look, all I see of these Democrats, like Adam Schiff—it’s all he does, he’ll have a meeting, and then he’ll leave, and he’ll call up the meeting, and then I’ll have a meeting and then he’ll leave. He left meetings where people are being interviewed, and then all of a sudden they say a story about what’s going on inside the meetings.

It’s probably illegal, what he’s doing. But the Democrats know it’s a hoax. It’s an excuse for them having lost the election. They know it’s a hoax. And yet, they are milking it to a fare-thee-well and I think the Republicans— although I will say that over the last month the Republicans have started to get very tough. Because they realize there’s no collusion whatsoever. There’s no collusion.

WSJ: Do you think they’re close to ending the probe?

Mr. Trump: I hope so. Hey, look, I got elected president. I won easily, 306 or 304, depending on your definition, to 223. I won a race that should never be won by a Republican because it’s so stacked in the Democrats’ favor. I mean, if you figure California, New York, and Illinois, you start off with losing that—you have to run the entire East Coast and every— and the entire Midwest.

I won an election that should never be won, because the Electoral College is far harder to win than the popular vote. The popular vote, for me, would have been much easier.

WSJ: But just to be clear, you’re not asking for them to shut those congressional investigations down?

Mr. Trump: No, I just want them to be tough, be strong. I also think that primary collusion, because there was no collusion on our side, the collusion was on the Democrat side with the Russians. And what went on with the FBI, where a man is tweeting to his lover that if she loses, we’ll essentially go back to the—we’ll go to the insurance policy, which is—if they lose, we’ll go to phase 2, and we’ll get this guy out of office.

I mean, this is the FBI we’re talking about. I think that is—that is treason. See, that’s treason right there.

WSJ: Does any of that make you less...

Mr. Trump: By the way, that’s a treasonous act. What he tweeted to his lover is a treasonous act.

WSJ: Does any of that make you less likely or less inclined to testify before Mueller, or talk to Mueller’s people?

Mr. Trump: Look, there has never been in the history of this country an administration that, number one, did nothing wrong, and number two, was more open with a special counsel. We have—my lawyers are very good people. We made a decision right at the beginning. And it wasn’t their original idea. They figured, like, well, we’ll fight this (inaudible).

After they looked at all the letters, all the facts, every email, they saw nothing. They said, “We should be open.” There has never been a more— they said, “You never did anything wrong.” To be honest, they probably were surprised, OK? As most lawyers would be. They said, “You never did anything wrong.”

And they said, and I agree with them, “We should be upfront, give them a”—we gave them everything.

WSJ: So if asked if...

Mr. Trump: There has never been, in the history—in the history of an administration anybody that was more open than we were. You understand that?

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: We gave them everything. We didn’t go to court and say, “You can’t have this document, you can’t have”—and what we gave them showed—I never got a phone call from Russia. I didn’t have a tweet. I didn’t have a—I had nothing. I didn’t have an email. I didn’t have a meeting. I didn’t have—did I have one meeting with—about Russia? And...

WSJ: Well, Mueller’s also looking at some other areas, right? Like obstruction of justice...

Mr. Trump: Well allow—let me—(inaudible). So, they make up a crime, and the crime doesn’t exist. And then they say obstruction. And how could there be obstruction on firing Comey? When the man who’s in charge of it wrote a letter that was far stronger than anything I would have written. He was in charge—Deputy Rosenstein. He wrote a letter that’s far stronger than even what I say.

And here’s another thing. A friend of mine brought this up the other day. Comey. Comey has proven to be a liar and a leaker. Proven. He tries to act like a choir boy. What he did with Hillary Clinton is outrageous. He saved her life, because all of those charges—I call it “Comey one, two, and three,” all of those charges and Comey won, she was guilty of. She should have been taken out of the campaign and been on trial.

He didn’t do that. He saved her life. But here’s the way you look at Comey. Everybody hated Comey, and Comey—by the way, the FBI, say what you want, go back to look at the day around Hillary—the FBI was in turmoil. Everybody hated Comey. The Democrats wanted him fired. Everybody wanted him out. You look at what Schumer said about him, you look at what everybody said. As soon as I fired him they said, “oh, he’s wonderful—he’s wonderful, how could you do that.”

So there’s no—you have a no-crime that was created, you have a phony crime and then they talk about obstruction. And how can they talk about obstruction when I was the most open person, in history, in terms of—there’s never been a paper we didn’t give them, there’s never been a question we didn’t answer.

Now, I could of done it differently. I’ve been, you know, pretty successful in the courts over the years, I’ve been a very successful person, you can check—USA Today said, “he does great in the courts,” OK?

Unknown: Sorry to interrupt. We have to—you’re late for your meeting. No, I know, finish this thought and then if—I’d love to get like an infrastructure or tax question in before you guys go—I know that was sort of the premise of the meeting.

(CROSSTALK)

Mr. Trump: They don’t want to talk about that—they don’t want to talk about the biggest tax bill (inaudible).

Unknown: But, we just have about two minutes left, so— you finish, yeah.

Mr. Trump: OK, all right, well we’ll do as much as we can.

So, just to finish, everybody wanted Comey fired. And then, when I fired, I never forget, when I fired, all these people that had just said, “You’ve got fire Comey”, they said, “oh, he just fired Comey.” Well now they’re—the—on the other side, they’re Democrats. So all of a sudden they change.

All you have to do is take a look, seriously—take a look at all these people, they all wanted him fired. And the FBI was a mess. When he announced the Hillary Clinton fiasco where she was guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty and then where they did the interview with no tape recorder, with no swearing in, with no this, with no that—you know the story.

But take a look at all of these people that became critics of my firing, they all wanted him fired. And they wanted him fired until I said, “he’s fired.” But the deputy, Rosenstein, who is in charge, he wrote a letter that was possibly or probably stronger than anything I would have written or did write.

WSJ: So you’re saying there was no obstruction, if Mueller asks you to come in and talk about it, would you—

(CROSSTALK)

Mr. Trump: Of course there was no obstruction—excuse me. Of course there was no obstruction. But there was no crime. So now they’re saying, could there be—now, I haven’t even heard that they’re looking at obstruct—I don’t know that they’re looking at obstruction.

But how can you—I’m sorry, this is the most open dialogue ever, I’ve given everything, number one. That’s not obstruction.

The other thing is, everybody wanted Comey fired. And, another thing, and this is just a few, Comey has proven to be a leaker and a liar and, if anything, I should get credit for firing him because it turned out I was right because many thing have been found out about Comey that—I mean, I should be given credit for having great insight because many things have been found out about Comey that would never have been found out if I didn’t fire him.

WSJ: (Inaudible) infrastructure (inaudible).

Mr. Trump: But just so you understand…

WSJ: Oh, sorry.

Mr. Trump: …The deputy attorney general, who’s in charge of the case, wanted—all you have to do is read his letter. So that’s— there’s no obstruction there.

WSJ: How about a welfare and a tax question real quick before we wrap it up?

Mr. Trump: Yeah, go ahead.

Unknown: Yeah, let’s finish on that and then you really do have to go, you’ve got a Roosevelt Room full of people waiting for you. So go ahead.

Mr. Trump: I do?

Unknown: Yes, you do.

Mr. Trump: OK, get me a list of those people.

Unknown: Yes, sir.

Mr. Trump: I’ll see the level of it.

(LAUGHTER)

I do enjoy this, actually.

WSJ: Yeah, this is fun, thank you for taking the time.

Mr. Trump: I do ask you this, treat me fairly.

WSJ: We always do.

Mr. Trump: We’ll do it—every month we’ll do one of these. But—because I do respect and I love and I think [WSJ editor in chief] Gerard [Baker]—I always call him the most elegant debate—I thought it was the best debate, maybe because I like that one good from my standpoint.

WSJ: Yeah.

Mr. Trump: But I thought he was very elegant. I always say, “You’re the elegant host.”

I went through some that weren’t so elegant. But all I’m asking is one thing, you know what I’m saying, it’s very easy, treat me fairly.

WSJ: We do.

So I just want to be crystal clear about this, you’re open to discussing comprehensive immigration reform, are you open to discussing a path to citizenship as part of that?

Mr. Trump: Ready? Comprehensive immigration reform is a far step from DACA. I am always open to discussing everything but that doesn’t mean we’re going to get anywhere close to getting it done.

I’d love to get something done if it’s appropriate. But there’s no—I think we will get DACA, I really believe we’re getting close to DACA and I’m dealing with some great people on the Democrat side. I’m dealing with some people that I really have gotten to like.

WSJ: Who?

Mr. Trump: And I really believe they have good intention. After we’re finished with DACA, assuming that gets done, I would certainly be open to discussing—you know, the comprehensive immigration. I don’t know that we’ll be able to make a deal on that one.

WSJ: Got it. And so on this—this welfare…

Mr. Trump: You understand what I mean.

WSJ: Yes, I now—I think we’re nice and clear on that one.

Mr. Trump: So that’s a very different—very different topic.

WSJ: Yeah, do you think welfare reform or infrastructure is more feasible?

Mr. Trump: Well I think we’re going to start with infrastructure. We’re very far down the line. Gary [Cohn] actually met with Elizabeth Warren yesterday and I heard, actually, had a very good conversation. My team met—Gary, you had a whole group of people—and they had a good conversation. We’ll start with infrastructure and we’ll see. If we do infrastructure I think that has to be bipartisan—and I think it will be. I think we’ll have a lot of Democrat support.

And I think with welfare reform that will have to be bipartisan. You know, we only have a majority of one and unless we get more Republicans in the next election or the next two elections we won’t be able to do that and as Republicans we’re going to have to have a bipartisan.

So, if we do welfare reform it’s going to have to be bipartisan.

WSJ: And just so we understand, what programs are welfare reform targets?

Mr. Trump: Well, I’d rather talk to you about that later because honestly, we’re doing infrastructure first; OK? We’ll do that again.

WSJ: Infrastructure—would that be a trillion-dollar direct federal outlay? Or is that a public/private partnership?

Mr. Trump: It’s going to be a combination of public/private which is now the new hot topic. We’ll be putting up approximately $200 billion. It could be as much as $1.8 trillion spent. We have many, many, wealthy countries, some of whom our country made wealthy, but we have many countries, any people that really want to put up tremendous amounts of money for the infrastructure. That gets it built faster, gets it built better, gets it built on time, on budget and the United States won’t be putting up all of the money.

WSJ: Where does the federal share come from?

Mr. Trump: The $200 billion?

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: Well, that’s not a large amount. I mean—think of this—I hate to say it but it’s not my fault and I did not want to go into Iraq, by the way. But as of two months ago we’re into the Middle East for $7 trillion. We made a lot of headway in the Middle East, by the way. I’ve knocked out ISIS and Syria and Iraq and all but— and we’re doing well in Afghanistan for the first time ever. But you’ll see the results over the next three or four months like you won’t believe.

WSJ: You’re not talking about taking it out of the military budget?

Mr. Trump: No, never out of the military. No—no, no. Nothing comes out of the military. We’re making the military strong, again. Just the opposite—we’re building the military budget very substantially; you know that.

WSJ: I mean do you have to find cuts or is this new spending? Would you be willing to spend new money on this?

Mr. Trump: No. This will be—this will be money that we will find. There’s a lot of places to find $200 billion. There are not a lot of places to find $1.8 trillion. I see Gary shaking his head, yes; correct? $200 billion sounds like a lot but relative to what we’re talking about it’s a number that we can easily handle.

Whereas again people will come in and put up vast amounts of money. They will supervise the projects, they will make sure they get built on time, on budget—or below budget which is even better. And so, what we’re talking about is about $200 billion. And, Gary, am I right when I say $1.7 trillion to $1.8 trillion?

Mr. Cohn: Exactly right, sir.

Mr. Trump: Approximately—so it will be actually $1.8 trillion of investment in our infrastructure which will largely rebuild our infrastructure.

That will include bridges, roadways, tunnels; it will include many things. One of the things we’re doing separate of that will be air-traffic control. Our air-traffic control is from a different planet. It’s horrible. It’s a horrible mess.

Our air-traffic control doesn’t work. They have spent billions and billions of dollars on it over the last seven years. Billions and it’s worthless. They had many different contractors doing many different locations using all different computers and computer companies. And when they hooked it up it didn’t work. So, I’m good at that stuff—we’ll fix it.

WSJ: One last quick question.

Mr. Trump: Go ahead.

WSJ: I just want to get a tax one in here too.

Mr. Trump: The tax bill has turned out to be far greater than we ever anticipated.

WSJ: Can you talk about it in a midterm framework here? Are you going to go out and sell this for the Republicans?

Mr. Trump: It’s selling itself, Michael. Michael, it’s selling itself.

WSJ: Do you plan to help in the midterms?

Mr. Trump: One thing nobody anticipated was that these companies would come in and pay all of this money to the employees—to millions and millions of employees. And AT&T started it, but it was picked up by Comcast and another one.

Many are announcing today—and the ones that aren’t announcing you know what’s happening? The employees are going, what about us? Did you forget us—to the ones that—that was never anticipated. That was just one of the many benefits. You know this bill—and I said from the beginning this bill will be so good—and the Democrats are very concerned. They’re very concerned. This bill has turned out to be even better than we thought. It’s really having a big—and I’m also hearing a lot of people are bringing money back in. You know, the $4 trillion that we’re talking about or whatever it may be. Nobody even knows what it is, but it’s a big number.

WSJ: Just on the midterms, are there concrete steps that the administration is taking to make sure Russia doesn’t interfere in the 2018 elections?

Mr. Trump: We’re going to be very careful. We’re going to be very, very, careful about Russia—and about anybody else, by the way.

WSJ: What are you doing to make sure?

Mr. Trump: We are absolutely—at the appropriate time and first of all we’re working on different solutions.

And as you know the last election was not affected in terms of votes—and I think you do understand that everybody—even the Democrats agree to that—a lot of people don’t write it. But we are looking at all sorts of failsafes and we are going to make sure that no country including Russia can have anything to do with the result of the midterms or any other election; OK? That’s what our country is all about.

Unknown: Thank you, guys, so much.

WSJ: Thank you, (inaudible). Thank you, Mr. President.

WSJ: Mr. President, do you expect Rex Tillerson to stay on?

Mr. Trump: Yeah, Rex and I are getting along very well.

WSJ: And Gary Cohn, and…

Mr. Trump: I don’t know, Gary, are you staying on?

Unknown: Gary, are you staying?

Mr. Cohn: Very happy. We were—we’re doing great things on the economy.

WSJ: Well usually, it’s—the New Year mark is a time when—when—when there’s—

Mr. Trump: Oh, I know it’s the time. But look, hey, Gary may leave and Rex may leave but I don’t anticipate it. I hope Gary stays and we’ll see.

WSJ: H.R.—H.R. McMaster?

Unknown: Guys, thank you—

Mr. Trump: You know what? I like him. I like him. I like them all.

WSJ: OK.

Mr. Trump: We’ll find out. But people do leave. You guys may leave The Wall Street Journal, right?

"Business leaders disbanded two CEO councils created by the White House, a move they said was protesting Donald Trump’s failure to sufficiently condemn racism, marking a dramatic break between U.S. companies and a president who has sought close ties with them.​

In the hours that followed Mr. Trump’s combative news conference Tuesday—during which he appeared to apportion blame equally between white supremacist groups and counterprotesters for lethal violence in Charlottesville, Va.—executives on two prominent advisory councils started calling each other to discuss whether to stay on.

On a 45-minute conference call that started around 11:30 a.m. ET Wednesday, members of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum decided to dissolve the group.

Blackstone Group LP chief Stephen A. Schwarzman, who organized the conference call, called the White House and spoke with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and a presidential adviser, to give him the news, according to a person familiar with the call. Around the same time, the manufacturing council also had a call and decided to disband.

Within minutes of the call to Mr. Kushner, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that he had dissolved the councils: “Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!”

A White House spokesman declined to comment.

The unraveling of the business councils marks a dramatic moment in corporate America’s relationship with the presidency.

From its start, the Trump White House had proclaimed an open-door policy for the country’s top business leaders. Many chief executives, while wary of being associated with the president’s more contentious policies, such as on immigration and climate change, have been eager to help Mr. Trump, a fellow businessman, shape his agenda of deregulation and tax overhaul.

In a combative press conference on Tuesday, President Donald Trump referenced the ""alt-left"" and blamed ""both sides"" for the violence in Charlottseville, Va. Here are the key moments. Photo: Getty

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.’s James Dimon wrote that he disagreed with Mr. Trump’s reaction to recent clashes in Charlottesville, according to an internal memo sent Wednesday afternoon and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. “Racism, intolerance and violence are always wrong…There is no room for equivocation here,” Mr. Dimon said. “It is a leader’s role, in business or in government, to bring people together, not tear them apart.”

Companies Wednesday stopped short of saying they would refuse to work with the White House in the future, though executives and corporate crisis managers noted that the reputational costs of sticking with the president have risen sharply.

Several CEOs have faced pressure from their own employees or parts of the public for remaining on the council, including International Business Machines Corp.’s Ginni Rometty and PepsiCo ’s Indra Nooyi.

Ms. Rometty and Ms. Nooyi, along with Boston Consulting Group’s Rich Lesser and BlackRock Inc. chief Laurence Fink, were among several leaders who joined Wednesday’s call prepared to resign from the Strategic and Policy Forum, participants said.

Mr. Schwarzman led Wednesday’s call and gave each member an opportunity to speak, people who participated on the call said.

“It became clear very quickly that there was a consensus” to disband the group in total, one participant said. “It was important that it be addressed as a group and not a drip-drip.”

Some panel members said they regretted losing a seat at the table as the White House deliberated on policies that could affect their companies, especially with a president who wasn’t familiar with many of their industries.

But members observed that the Strategic and Policy Forum only met twice in about eight months, with about half of the council members attending both meetings.

Jim McNerney, the former CEO of Boeing, didn’t agree with disbanding the group, according to people on the call, yet agreed to go along with the decision. Attempts to reach Mr. McNerney for comment were unsuccessful.

Toward the end of the conversation, a participant raised the specter of a “tweet storm” in reaction from Mr. Trump, participants said. Earlier in the week, Mr. Trump tweeted angrily after the CEOs of Merck & Co., Intel Corp. and Under Armour Inc. announced they were quitting his manufacturing council.

Business leaders now face the challenge of trying to stay in the president’s ear without a formal advisory position. Two companies whose leaders served on the Strategic and Policy Forum indicated Wednesday they would remain open to advising the president on future policy matters.

Created in the early days of the Trump presidency, the Strategic and Policy Forum and manufacturing-advisory council gathered CEOs for Mr. Trump to consult as he implemented a broad economic plan that included reworking the U.S. tax code and trying to stem the flow of U.S. jobs to other countries.

Individual members of both councils had discussed disbanding the forum for months, especially after the decision to leave the Paris climate accord in June and again in July when Mr. Trump barred transgender individuals from serving in the military, members said.

Yet plenty of executives saw value in remaining on the forums until Tuesday afternoon’s news conference. Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky issued a statement early Tuesday that said he would remain on the manufacturing council and advocate for values like diversity and inclusion from the inside.

But President Trump’s news conference made staying untenable for most members. On Wednesday, Mr. Gorsky issued another statement saying he was leaving the council. “The President’s most recent statements equating those who are motivated by race-based hate with those who stand up against hatred is unacceptable and has changed our decision to participate,” Mr. Gorsky said.

Executives have faced tough questions from workers and young recruits over their relationship with the White House. A poll initiated by Boston Consulting Group employees this week on Fishbowl, a social network for professionals, found 83% of more than 100 respondents thought Mr. Lesser, the CEO, should step down from the advisory council.

Around 40 people protested outside the New York offices of J.P. Morgan and then Blackstone on Wednesday, and social-media campaigns heavily criticized corporate chiefs for not quitting the councils.

Color of Change, a nonprofit activist group, spearheaded a campaign with the hashtag #QuitTheCouncil and aimed its posts at executives including Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison and PepsiCo ’s Ms. Nooyi. Ms. Morrison withdrew from the manufacturing council Wednesday morning.

"DEMOCRATS HAVE FORFEITED THEIR LEAD OVER THE GOP AS THE PARTY WITH THE MORE FAVORABLE IMAGE. More voters want Democrats to control the next Congress than want Republican leadership, polling shows. But that doesn't mean there's much affection for the Democratic Party.

The Republican Party has had an image problem for years. Since 2005, voters have held a more unfavorable view of the party than a favorable one, Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling shows.

By contrast, Democrats have had a positive image during some of those years. The parties' profiles were widely different in early 2009, for example, when 49% viewed the Democratic Party favorably, while only 26% had a positive view of the GOP. Since then, the Democrats' image has tarnished. In August, each party was viewed favorably by 32% of voters and unfavorably by 43%.

IN A SEPARATE MEASURE, Journal/NBC polling shows that neither party has a strong claim to be most in-tune with Americans' thinking. Some 52% in August said the Democrats are out of step with the thinking of most Americans, while 56% said Republicans are out of step. And voters are nearly equally cool toward congressional leaders in both parties: Both House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell are viewed far more unfavorably than favorably.

If Americans hold both parties in disfavor nearly equally, why did Democrats hold an 8-point lead in the most recent Journal/NBC News poll on the question of which party should control Congress? One possibility is that voter decisions this year are based less on feelings about the parties than about the biggest player in national politics, President Trump, who has drawn more disapproval than approval for his job performance during his time in office.",politics

"The world oil market is notoriously quick to react to headlines, but a seemingly significant one last week from the owner of the world’s largest reserves didn’t cause so much as a blip.

According to reports, all from Venezuelan authorities, the China Development Bank earlier this month pledged either $250 million or $5 billion “in favor of the increasing and strengthening of the country’s oil production.”

That Venezuela’s major industry needs “increasing and strengthening” is beyond question. Oil output crashed below a three-decade low to 1.34 million barrels a day last month. That is a million less than just three years ago and 2 million below the level when Hugo Chávez took power in 1999.

Chávismo clearly has been very bad for Venezuela’s oil production. Until recently it was very good for China, however, and its twin goals of expanding its influence and satisfying its need for oil. A report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies stated earlier this year that “China’s influence in Latin America is neither transparent nor market-oriented.”

But China clearly miscalculated in Venezuela, where it is now throwing good money after bad. The CSIS tallies $55 billion in energy-related loans alone that it has extended. Unable to come up with hard currency to service them, Venezuela has been paying in discounted barrels of oil but struggled even to do that after prices collapsed in 2014. China offered a “grace period” on some loans.

At one point when prices were higher and its oil industry less decrepit, Venezuela was sending China 600,000 barrels a day, according to Russ Dallen, the chief executive of Caracas Capital Markets, who has done extensive work untangling Venezuela’s opaque finances. He estimated that has brought the balance down to about $20 to $23 billion, plus another $3 billion to $4 billion owed to Russian oil company Rosneft.

The cash drain from these enormous debts may have exacerbated the decline in output, and there is scant chance that China’s latest infusion will do much to arrest the fall. Hence the market’s shrug at the news. But why does cash keep flowing in?

Part of it is the potential equity value of that bad debt. Chinese and Russian companies have been given valuable hydrocarbon concessions—in some cases including properties expropriated from Western firms such as Exxon Mobil . While past loans are a disaster, China and Russia now have investments to protect. Disbursing more modest, targeted sums makes sense.

Venezuela needs that cash. Right now it only can sell about 500,000 barrels a day for hard currency.

For those interested in the short-term impact on the oil market, new loans should be viewed as a way to protect the status quo. They make an outright collapse in output through internal unrest less likely, but they probably won’t arrest the decline either.",world

Is the “progressive” left finally ready to acknowledge the benefits of pro-growth tax reform? The intriguing possibility comes to us courtesy of the ABC television program, “The View.” That’s where Meghan McCain sparked a heated discussion this week by wisely warning about the miseries resulting from socialism.

When program host Whoopi Goldberg raised the subject of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the socialist selected by voters in the Democratic primary for a U.S. house seat in New York City, Ms. McCain helpfully noted that socialism has failed worldwide and is currently resulting in malnutrition and even starvation in Venezuela.

This is not necessarily a message that folks gathered around a Manhattan television set like to hear. Real Clear Politics reports:

Meghan McCain and Joy Behar clashed over the rise of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and ‘normalization’ of democratic socialism on Tuesday’s edition of ABC’s The View. McCain said she hopes Democrats run on the democratic socialism platform because they will “lose spectacularly.”

“At a certain point, you run out of spending other people’s money,” McCain, quoting Margaret Thatcher, said.

The conversation got so heated that host and moderator Whoopi Goldberg had to step in to stop the two talking over each other.

Behar cited several Scandinavian countries as proof that socialism does work.

This response from Ms. Behar is almost as encouraging as Ms. McCain’s stalwart advocacy for liberty, and not only because it signals that even the northeast media crowd has stopped looking for silver linings in the societal disaster that is Venezuela. In recent years Scandinavian countries have been moving away from socialism after observing proof that it doesn’t work.

Ms. Behar has perhaps learned of the virtues of Scandinavian public policy from Bernie Sanders, who frequently sang its praises during his 2016 presidential campaign. Perhaps because the radical views of the Vermont socialist hardened in the 1960s and 1970s and have proven impervious to new data in the years since, Mr. Sanders may not have grasped the encouraging news from our northern friends.

In 2016 Swedish academic Daniel Schatz, then a visiting scholar at Columbia University, noted that the explosion of Nordic social welfare programs in Mr. Sanders’ formative years occurred only because the countries had grown wealthy by allowing more open economies than their European neighbors.

After enacting these expensive entitlements, Scandinavian voters then realized that their only hope of paying for them lay in the preservation of robust market economies.

The international tax table maintained by the accounting firm KPMG shows the success these countries have had in holding corporate income taxes to competitive rates. Over the last 15 years Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have all made impressive cuts to their corporate income tax rates. Thanks to the Trump tax cuts enacted last year, the U.S. is finally operating in their neighborhood.

When it comes to overall tax competitiveness, the Tax Foundation ranks Sweden in the top 10 among OECD countries, with Norway, Finland and Denmark not too far behind.

Also unlike Venezuela and other socialist experiments, Scandinavian countries maintain predictable legal systems under the rule of law and less business regulation than many of their competitors in the international marketplace. The Heritage Foundation—not exactly an outfit known for being soft on socialist countries—publishes an index of economic freedom and ranks Iceland, Denmark and Sweden above the United States, with Norway and Finland also in the top 26. Venezuela clocks in at 179th, just ahead of North Korea.

Does this mean that voters can hope that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is a Scandinavian-style “socialist” who wants the U.S. to have a globally competitive corporate income tax rate? Her recent comments suggest not, but perhaps she’ll be willing to appear on “The View” and give Ms. McCain the chance to persuade her.

"Spare a thought for Chuck Schumer. The Senate Minority Leader is under enormous political pressure to defeat Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, or at least pretend that he’s trying very hard. His strategy so far is to stall for time and compare the nominee to Richard Nixon. Bear with us; you’ll enjoy this.

As expected, Mr. Schumer has demanded millions of documents from Mr. Kavanaugh’s years in government to push a confirmation vote past the November election. The New Yorker has refused even to meet with Mr. Kavanaugh unless Republicans first agree to let Democrats dive through the Bush and Clinton archives. When he was Minority Leader in 2013, Mitch McConnell met with nominee Elena Kagan within two days.

Potomac Watch Podcast

This Democratic sitzkrieg isn’t likely to work. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota have already said they’ll meet with the nominee, date to be determined. Others running for re-election will likely follow as their opponents back home highlight the pettiness of not meeting.

More substantively, Republicans have no reason to agree to what are unreasonable Democratic demands. Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is trying to work out a document deal with ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein. But Democrats are seeking literally millions of documents from Mr. Kavanaugh’s years as Staff Secretary in the George W. Bush White House that are irrelevant to his views or his qualifications for the Court.

The White House has said it is willing to produce some 80,000 document pages and 200,000 email pages from Mr. Kavanaugh’s time in the White House counsel’s office. This is more than the 173,000 pages produced for Justice Kagan’s White House service, and the 182,000 pages for Neil Gorsuch’s time in the George W. Bush Justice Department.

The Obama Administration produced no documents from Justice Kagan’s years in the Solicitor General’s office. The reason was that such documents were said to be the crown jewels of the executive branch’s deliberations on legal issues. They surely would have been relevant to how Justice Kagan would rule on the bench, but failing to turn those over is a precedent.

Documents from Mr. Kavanaugh’s time as White House Staff Secretary weren’t created by him and would say little or nothing definitive about his views on the issues. The Staff Secretary’s job is to channel to the President the work product of the rest of the White House and government. The documents relate to Mr. Bush’s decisions, not Judge Kavanaugh’s.

If Democrats want to examine a relevant record, they have more than 300 of his judicial opinions to inspect. When she was nominated, Ms. Kagan had none. Mr. Grassley stands on solid ground if he chooses to limit the document search on Mr. Kavanaugh to the standard that prevailed for Justice Kagan.

Which brings us to Mr. Schumer’s resort to Dick Nixon, which suggests he’s getting desperate. Mr. Kavanaugh submitted his speeches, opinions and other writings to the Judiciary Committee last week, and it included the transcript of an exchange about U.S. v. Nixon, the famous 8-0 ruling in which the Supreme Court ordered President Nixon to turn the Watergate tapes over to a federal court.

In a 1999 panel discussion with Bill Clinton’s defense team, Mr. Kavanaugh pointed out that the executive privilege arguments used by President Clinton were similar to those used by Nixon in the tapes case. He then argued that a Clinton lawyer on the panel had “not argued that Nixon was wrongly decided,” adding “but maybe Nixon was wrongly decided, heresy though it is to say so.”

Mr. Schumer jumped on these snippets to charge on Monday that “if Kavanaugh would have let Nixon off the hook, what is he willing to do for President Trump?”

***

The answer is that Mr. Kavanaugh wouldn’t have left Nixon off the hook and he’s certainly willing to hold Presidents accountable under the law. It’s clear from the context of the 1999 discussion that Mr. Kavanaugh was debating the compatibility of the Clinton arguments with the Nixon case, not his views of the 8-0 ruling on the merits.

The nominee’s views are clear from other statements over the years in which he has supported Nixon. In a 2014 speech Judge Kavanaugh called the ruling one of the three “most significant cases in which the judiciary stood up to the President,” along with Marbury v. Madison and the Youngstown steel case.

In a 1998 law review article, Mr. Kavanaugh said there is “no need to revisit” Nixon and that it should not be overruled. He added that the ruling “reflects the proper balance of the President’s need for confidentiality and the government’s interest in obtaining all relevant evidence for criminal proceedings.”

Ken Starr and others who worked with Mr. Kavanaugh in the independent counsel’s office in the 1990s have also said that the nominee supported the Nixon ruling.

The political point of all this is that Republicans shouldn’t be the least bit defensive about Judge Kavanaugh’s record, and Mr. Grassley has good reasons to limit a document search. Mr. Schumer is the fellow who is employing some Nixonian deception.",politics

"The pardon power has its most compelling use when correcting a government injustice. President Trump used his authority on Tuesday for precisely such a purpose in pardoning Dwight Hammond Jr. and his son Steven.

In 2011 the federal government charged the two Oregon ranchers with arson and destruction of federal property for having done nothing more than utilize the same fire-management tools that the government routinely employs. The Hammonds had set fires in 2001 and 2006—one to fight invasive species, another to protect against a wildfire. Both fires unintentionally spread to burn nearby public grazing land—139 acres in the first case, a single acre in the second.

A federal jury acquitted them of most charges but found them guilty of setting the fires—which they’d already admitted. A federal judge gave them reduced sentences, saying that anything more would “shock the conscience” and be “grossly disproportionate to the severity” of their conduct. We wrote about their case in 2016.

The Obama Justice Department, in its usual restraint against its political opponents, appealed and persuaded a different judge in 2015 to impose a mandatory five years each under the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. Yes, a terrorism statute.

The exercise smacked of retribution and coercion, since the Hammonds remain one of the last private ranching families in the Harney Basin. The feds have been on a campaign to drive out private landowners to expand a federal bird refuge around Malheur Lake. In recent years the feds have revoked grazing permits, mismanaged water to let ranchlands flood, and harassed ranchers with regulatory actions.

The Hammonds refused to give in to these tactics and ended up in prison. The elder Dwight Hammond, 76, has now served three years, while Steven, 49, has served four. They have also paid $400,000 to settle a federal civil suit against them.

The federal treatment of the Hammonds fueled the 40-day citizen takeover in 2016 of Oregon’s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. That occupation (which the Hammonds did not endorse) was inexcusable and ended in violence, though it highlighted the growing fury of Western landowners over the federal government’s bullying practices.

The Trump Interior and Agriculture Departments are attempting to rein in these abuses, reminding federal employees that private landowners are crucial for conservation and economic stability across rural America. The change in policy is overdue, as was justice for the Hammonds.",politics

"Saudi Arabia is ordering its citizens to leave Canada, selling its financial assets there and freezing trade between the two countries as part of an extraordinary diplomatic spat that has brought into global view the kingdom’s extreme sensitivity to Western criticism.

The steps follow the Canada’s foreign ministry’s chastising Saudi Arabia for its recent arrest of human-rights activists. Canada’s foreign ministry, in a Twitter message sent on Friday, called on Saudi authorities to “immediately release” the activists.

The Saudi government rejected what it described as Canada’s unacceptable interference in its domestic affairs, and on Monday expelled the Canadian ambassador to the kingdom and recalled its own from Ottawa.

Since then, Saudi Arabia has unveiled measures intended to hurt Canada financially.

Saudi Arabia’s central bank instructed its fund managers to sell off their Canadian holdings, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The kingdom has also halted all new business transactions between the two countries; it stopped direct flights to Canada; and it ordered Saudi patients and students to leave the country. Some 7,000 Saudi students are currently enrolled in Canadian universities on government-sponsored scholarships.

The Saudi decision to sell Canadian financial assets is poised to affect hundreds of millions of Canadian dollars of stocks, bonds and cash. The relatively small selloff isn’t expected to carry a major financial impact for Canada, but it marks a sharp escalation of a spat that erupted from a tweet.

The move “sends a very bad signal to foreign investors,” said a Gulf-based banker with knowledge of the matter. “Who will want to invest in a country where such decisions can be taken?”

Representatives of Saudi Arabia’s central bank weren’t available to comment. The kingdom’s energy ministry late Wednesday said “the current diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and Canada will not, in any way, impact Saudi Aramco’s relations with its customers in Canada.”

While the amount at stake isn’t large, a diplomatic dust-up that shows no signs of abating may have financial implications for Canada.

The Canadian dollar swooned for a brief period in Wednesday morning trading on reports of a Canadian selloff ordered by Saudi Arabia’s central bank. The currency largely recovered the losses during the day.

Canadian wheat and barley growers are also set to deal with the fallout. The Saudi Grains Organization, the state agency that buys grains and manages reserves, told Canadian producers it “can no longer accept milling wheat or feed barley cargoes of Canadian origin,” according to an email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Canada sold roughly 70,000 metric tons of wheat to Saudi Arabia in the most recent crop year, a fraction of the 16.2 million metric tons of Canadian wheat growers shipped overseas. Barley producers could face the bigger hit, as Saudi Arabia accounted for 7% of all grain shipped abroad, said Cam Dahl, president of Cereals Canada, an industry association.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday said Canadian officials are in talks with Saudi Arabia to resolve the row.

“We don’t want to have poor relations with Saudi Arabia,” Mr. Trudeau said. “We have respect for their importance in the world, and recognize it is making great progress on a number of important issues.”

Still, the Canadian leader reiterated he would continue to champion human rights across the world. “Canadians have always expected our government to speak strongly, firmly, clearly and politely about the need to respect human rights at home and around the world. We will continue to do this.”

Earlier Wednesday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir defended the government’s response to Canada’s criticism of its human-rights record.

“The crisis with Canada was imposed on us because of its interference in our internal affairs,” he told reporters in Riyadh. “Canada made a mistake and should correct its wrongdoing towards Saudi Arabia.”

Since May, Saudi authorities have arrested some of the country’s most prominent rights activists, many of whom had campaigned for women’s right to drive. At least 14 remain in jail. The Saudi government has said those arrested are suspected of having conspired with unspecified foreign entities.

Mr. Jubeir said Saudi authorities have been investigating the arrested rights activists as “a matter of national security.”

Saudi Arabia’s regional allies, including the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, have rallied in support of its hard-line stance on Canada. The U.S. has so far declined to take a position.

“Both sides need to diplomatically resolve this together. We can’t do it for them,” U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said during a press briefing on Tuesday.

While others have rebuked Saudi Arabia over the arrest of the activists—including the U.S. and the European Union—the kingdom likely chose to target Canada because it isn’t a vitally important ally and because of the relatively small amount of business at stake, some analysts say. The broader message Saudi Arabia is sending to Western countries is that it won’t tolerate harsh criticism of its domestic policies.

“Saudi Arabia is saying: Our market is opening up, our market provides opportunities, but they can dry up if you are on the wrong side of us politically,” said Hani Sabra, founder of Alef Advisory, a U.S.-based political-risk firm.

Two-way trade between Canada and Saudi Arabia amounted to about $3 billion last year, according to Canadian government data. By comparison, U.S.-Saudi trade in 2016 stood at more than 10 times that level, based on U.S. data.

Canada’s plan to sell $11.5 billion in light-armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia has been met with criticism at home. Nongovernmental organizations have pressed that Canada open a probe on whether Canadian-made vehicles have been used to commit human-rights abuses. It is unclear if the diplomatic spat will affect the deal. Officials at the General Dynamics Land Systems, whose Canadian unit is building the armored vehicles, declined to comment on the fate of the deal.

Saudi Arabia has used economic pressure tactics toward other countries seen as allies. Last year, Riyadh and three Arab allies abruptly cut relations with Qatar and imposed a trade embargo on it, accusing the tiny Gulf country of pursuing a disruptive regional policy. At the time, Saudi government entities either sold off their Qatar holdings or refused to acquire new assets.

And in November, Saudi officials summoned Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri to Riyadh, where he stepped down from his post, citing the dominant role of Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy, in Lebanese politics. This sparked accusations that Saudi Arabia, a longtime patron of Mr. Hariri, was behind the resignation.

After Germany’s then-foreign minister publicly criticized Saudi Arabia for pressuring Mr. Hariri to step down against his will, Riyadh recalled its ambassador from Berlin and quietly suspended new business deals with its European ally.

"Puerto Rico is still beset by damaged infrastructure and waterlogged real estate nearly a year after Hurricane Maria. But its hotel market is emerging as a rare bright spot.

Buoyed by demand from relief workers and a surprisingly strong showing from tourists, the territory’s hotels are enjoying better-than-expected results.

The average daily room rate for the first six months of 2018 was $214.54, higher than the comparable period over the past five years, according to lodging research firm STR. Hotels have also enjoyed occupancy rates of 77% through June, a five-percentage-point increase from last year’s pre-hurricane rates.

Most of the territory’s high-end hotels are at least partially operational, including the Wyndham Grand Rio Mar and the El San Juan. Operators of others—like the Caribe Hilton, the St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort and Dorado Beach Ritz-Carlton Reserve—say they are planning to open by year’s end.

“Right now, it’s literally a race to get open,” said Andrew Dickey, a senior vice president at real-estate services firm JLL Hotels & Hospitality. “If you look at assets that are open, they’re all outperforming historical levels.”

Some high-end residential properties, particularly those priced in the $1 million to $1.5 million range, are also selling well, said Hector Aponte of real-estate services firm Newmark Grubb Caribbean. He attributes that in part to increased interest from U.S. citizens hoping to establish residency to take advantage of favorable tax treatment. Most Puerto Rico residents don’t pay federal personal income tax.

Dorado Beach has closed or has contracts for eight estate homes and condo residences, totaling almost $50 million over the past three months, according to Kenneth Blatt, chief operating officer of Caribbean Property Group LLC’s hospitality division, which controls much of the 1,400-acre resort. Two of the estate homes sold for pre-hurricane prices, while the six condo residences were discounted by 2% to 3%.

Hurricane Maria left widespread damage across Puerto Rico. The Dorado Beach Ritz-Carlton Reserve on Sept. 25, 2017. Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images

Other real-estate sectors in Puerto Rico remain troubled. Industrial and office vacancy rates are low. Disaster-relief organizations and utility companies have moved in, but the majority are on short-term leases, Mr. Aponte said.

Hotel momentum could also slow as more properties reopen and more rooms come back online. STR estimates that the supply of hotel rooms is down 18% in the year to date, helping offset a 12.1% drop in demand.

But some analysts think other drivers can continue to boost hotel revenue. The resiliency of Puerto Rico’s leisure industry is in part the result of insurance payouts, which have funded renovations, and the strength of the U.S. economy, said Christian Charre, a senior vice president at research firm CBRE Hotels.

Air travel returned to pre-hurricane levels earlier this summer. The number of cruise vessels arriving into the San Juan port—which survived the storm relatively unscathed—actually increased in the winter immediately following Hurricane Maria.

Puerto Rico suffered in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane. The number of people visiting during the 2017-2018 high season, which generally runs between December and April, was on average 49% lower than the previous season, according to data from Puerto Rico’s government.

But there are signs that tourists are coming back: In April, the most recent month for which data is available, more than 128,000 tourists arrived—a nearly 50% increase from December. That is a much bigger gap than in past years, when April business is usually only marginally better than in December.

The Wyndham Grand Rio Mar, which was one of the few hotels that didn’t fully shut down after the storm, has been serving tourists since March 1. Even after competitors reopened, the Rio Mar has continued to produce record-breaking occupancy rates.

This year the hotel saw the best June occupancy rate in its history, according to hotel general manager Nils Stolzlechner. The hotel hasn’t discounted its rates for international travelers, he said.

The Caribe Hilton initially thought its damage would be repaired quickly enough to return to full capacity by December 2017. But moisture testing revealed the damage was “way beyond what we could have perceived from our naked eye,” said hotel general manager Pablo Torres.

Hilton management decided to shut the hotel down completely and invest some $100 million in repairing and renovating it, including re-creating the lobby that had been renovated just two years ago. It is accepting reservations from Dec. 21 onward.

The Blackstone Group -owned El Conquistador resort, located on the island’s northeastern tip, is one of the few properties still in the process of evaluating damages and is unlikely to open soon, a Blackstone spokeswoman said in an email.

"Fresh doubts are emerging about the potency of a U.S.-led sanctions campaign aimed at crippling North Korea’s economy and forcing the country to end its atomic-weapons programs, as denuclearization talks have stalled.

A confidential new United Nations report, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, says Pyongyang, often with help from people in Russia and China, has been able to circumvent restrictions, rendering “the latest U.N. sanctions ineffective.”

Citing U.S. intelligence, U.N. investigators found a “massive increase” in fuel shipments to North Korea involving Russian and Chinese ships, as well as numerous examples of coal shipments to China from North Korea.

The U.N. report also called out Chinese companies for buying tens of millions of dollars of North Korean iron, steel and other products. Chinese firms have maintained joint ventures with North Korean partners, despite a U.N. ban last year, the report says. Chinese tourism to North Korea is rebounding.

All of that amounts to a serious setback for what the Trump administration calls a maximum-pressure campaign to isolate North Korea, cut off its energy supplies and curb its ability to raise money through exports.

China and Russia have rejected U.S. accusations they aren’t fully enforcing U.N. sanctions on North Korea. Pyongyang disputes the sanctions’ legality.

Pyongyang’s success in skirting export and import limits shows that, after decades of international pressure, it has built a resilient web of funding streams and trade networks that are difficult to completely sever.

There is little doubt North Korea’s economy is being hurt, but the country’s sanctions-evasion tactics could give it breathing room as negotiations with Washington have reached an impasse.

“I’m very concerned that our maximum-pressure campaign is faltering,” Ed Royce, the Republican House foreign-affairs committee chairman, said last week. “Kim appears to be using talks, as he has time and time again, to probe for weaknesses and buy time.”

Top Trump officials say the negotiations are proof the pressure campaign is working, but have expressed growing frustration in recent months over what they see as easing enforcement by China and Russia, in particular.

“The full implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions remains mandatory for all member states,” U.S. envoy to the U.N. Nikki Haley said late last week.

Other evidence suggests North Korea is earning significant sums of money from overseas businesses and guest workers, including North Korean restaurants that were supposed to close but remain open in some countries.

The new U.N. report also found North Korean involvement in illicit arms sales, citing evidence that a Syrian arms trafficker brokered a deal for Houthi rebels in Yemen to buy rocket-propelled grenades, ballistic missiles and other weapons from North Korea.

One of the best-known businesses linked to Pyongyang, a military communications equipment company called Global Communications Co. and described by the U.N. as a front for North Korean intelligence, continues operating despite being cited in U.N. reports.

Malaysia’s government said it closed Glocom’s operations in the country last year. Yet Mike Kuah, who runs Fabulous System Bhd., a Kuala Lumpur-based company that sells military radios, says he purchased battlefield radios this year from Glocom after locating it online.

Glocom uploaded new marketing videos to YouTube this year and advertises multiple products on Twitter.

Mr. Kuah said he had no idea of Glocom’s ties to North Korea, believing at first the equipment was South African based on its appearance. An invoice provided by Mr. Kuah for the radios he bought showed an address for the company in Shenzhen, China. A Journal reporter tried to visit the site but found it didn’t exist.

Mr. Kuah didn’t respond when asked to whom he later sold the radios. Under U.N. sanctions, any trade in North Korean military equipment is illegal.

Deliveries of petroleum products to North Korea, meanwhile, represent a particularly difficult problem for Washington because they offer a lifeline to North Korea’s economy.

U.N. sanctions imposed late last year amounted to a nearly 90% ban on oil and refined petroleum, which the Security Council has said are vital to Pyongyang’s military and nuclear programs.

The Journal reported last week that North Korean ships had brought in at least 89 illicit cargoes of fuel in the first five months of the year via ship-to-ship transfers, primarily with Chinese or Russian counterparts. The estimated volume is roughly a third of the country’s average consumption before the current sanctions regime was put into place, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

North Korea’s Chon Ma San made four deliveries in April and June, delivering up to 74,000 barrels of fuel oil into the country’s Nampo port weeks after the U.N. blacklisted it, according to U.S. intelligence reports reviewed by the Journal.

Although North Korea’s tightly sealed borders and limited information flow make it hard to assess how deeply sanctions are affecting the country’s economy, they are widely believed to have had an impact last year, when the economy is thought to have contracted.

Yet after tripling late last year, fuel prices have fallen back to near pre-quota levels, according to data collected by the South Korea-based website NK Daily.

Unofficial exchange rates have been stable. At the border city of Sinuiju on Aug. 21, a dollar traded for 8,140 won, only up a hair from 8,100 in October 2016.

Many economists speculate Pyongyang is burning though its foreign-currency reserves to help prop up the won and prevent hyperinflation, forecasting more pain likely by 2019. But others argue the won’s stability shows sanctions haven’t been as effective as hoped.

President Trump and others have singled out China for what they say is lax enforcement. Some former senior U.S. Treasury officials say the recent stall in negotiations aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and normalizing relations with the U.S. is at least in part a political consequence of weak sanctions enforcement.

China appears to be enforcing many of the rules. In Dandong, a major conduit of China-North Korea trade, businesses say restrictions continue to crimp cross-border commerce, with Chinese border officials checking tourists’ luggage for products prohibited by sanctions.

In Hunchun, another border city, seafood traders say their businesses have withered under a U.N. ban on North Korean seafood exports. An “international seafood trading center,” opened in mid-2016, is derelict.

Even so, some seafood wholesalers and restaurants say they are able to rely on smuggling and other measures to get around the ban, with goods ferried at night or delivered in small quantities to avoid detection.

“The government has been tacitly allowing the North Korean seafood trade,” especially after Mr. Kim’s visits to China this year, said a seafood-industry worker who would only give his surname, Qi.

China also appears to be relaxing some of its own restrictions put in place in recent years when Beijing wanted to register anger over Pyongyang’s missile programs.

A thaw in bilateral ties this year has seen a surge in Chinese travel to North Korea, for instance. Roughly a thousand Chinese travelers entered North Korea daily in recent months, a multifold increase from a year earlier, travel agencies in Dandong said.

Although income from tourism isn’t enormous, it can help offset losses in industries affected by sanctions, experts say. Demand has been such that there aren’t enough tour buses and hotel rooms in North Korea, according to tour operators in Dandong.

Hunchun this summer set up an immigration-services center to process travel papers for Chinese tourists within an hour. Dandong’s tourism authority has published sample North Korea itineraries on its website.

“It’s not in China’s interests to squeeze North Korea to the brink of collapse,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor at Renmin University in Beijing.

The U.N. panel also said it found more than 200 Chinese joint ventures with North Korea, collaboration banned last year by the Security Council. According to a July U.S. Treasury Department advisory, those companies conduct business including software development, construction and aquaculture.

"Moody’s has upgraded India’s sovereign debt for the first time in more than a decade. Investors should question the timing.

The global credit-rating company on Friday lifted India to Baa 2, a couple of notches above junk, from Baa 3—its first upgrade since 2004 and the first in nearly as long from any global rating company. Standard & Poor’s hasn’t upgraded India since 2007.

Moody’s cited expectations of “continued progress on economic and institutional reforms,” and populist Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has indeed announced some sweeping overhauls over the past year. But his botched demonetization program and the imposition of a goods-and-services tax have left the economy—especially the lowest rungs—writhing.

Growth has continually edged lower over the past year and a half. Last month, the central bank cut its 2017 projection to 6.7% from 7.3%. Inflation, a persistent problem, is creeping up again, and the central bank expects it to exceed its targets, as do the likes of Goldman Sachs. A big bank bailout looks inadequate to address the financial system’s deep-seated problems.

Nor is India’s fiscal position strong. For example, there’s Mr. Modi’s $7.4 billion program to waive debts of struggling farmers, expected to increase spending and widen the government deficit. The central bank last month warned that such government policy changes could also spur inflation and drive up borrowing costs.

Moody’s upgrade is a denial of the current state of the Indian economy. It acknowledges that government debt, at 68% of GDP, is higher than similarly rated peers’—but asserts that “reforms offer greater confidence” that it will remain stable. It notes the disruption and the hit to growth caused by the Modi overhauls, but argues that the positive impacts will be seen in time.

That, however, merely raises the question, Why upgrade now? Why not wait for signs—however nascent—that the measures are actually effective?

The yield on benchmark Indian government bonds have been rising—now at 7%, the highest in a year. Moody’s aside, everyone seems skeptical.

"Let’s call it China’s Dreamers moment.

The city of Beijing began evicting large numbers of rural migrants this past week, as part of a safety campaign after a deadly fire in a slum tenement that housed many migrants.

In the U.S., the so-called Dreamers are young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. In China, the dreamers are domestic migrants who moved from farms to megacities in pursuit of better opportunities. Many of these migrants live as second-class citizens, with tenuous residency rights and limited access to city social services.

These migrants have fueled China’s booming tech industry. They drive ride-sharing cars and deliver parcels and food ordered online. Their better-educated peers are programmers and professionals at internet companies in Beijing. A few major company founders were migrants.

When President Donald Trump decided to end the U.S. program that protects the Dreamers from deportation, American tech companies signed open letters and supported lawsuits to stop the repeal. They argue that the Dreamers are contributing members of the community and add to the U.S. economy’s competitive edge.

No such protests emerged from China’s tech firms in response to the evictions in Beijing, one of the country’s biggest internet hubs. In fact, online news and social-media platforms, most of them based in Beijing, scrubbed their sites of critical postings, including a public appeal from lawyers, academics and labor activists to stop the campaign.

Tech companies haven’t sat on their hands. E-commerce company JD.com sent a text message last weekend offering stipends and the use of company dormitories and vehicles to any Beijing employees forced to move.

But the Chinese tech companies’ public silence over the mass evictions shows an underlying truth about their position in China. Despite the economic growth, jobs and innovation they create, the tech companies remain reliant on the authoritarian government, and that limits their influence.

“Everybody understands that the government is in charge in China,” Liu Yang, a 25-year-old college graduate from the central city of Zhengzhou who went to Beijing this year to look for a programmer job, told me. “Companies don’t want to cause trouble.”

Mr. Liu was evicted from the apartment he shared with two roommates near Beijing’s tech center, Haidian, last week with only one day’s notice.

For the tech companies, the government is both overseer and customer. It provides business licenses and regulates expansion into new sectors, such as internet finance. Tech companies form partnerships with the government to develop censorship tools to block online content and facial recognition technologies to monitor citizens. E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding and social-media and games behemoth Tencent Holdings are offering up their data-crunching abilities to local governments to build “smart cities.”

Says a government-relations executive who has worked in the tech industry for many years, companies can’t afford to offend the new party secretary of Beijing, a protégé of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Thousands of migrants are estimated to have been evicted, many on short notice, as authorities inspect buildings in the aftermath of the fire in southern Beijing on Nov. 18 that killed 19 people, 17 of them migrant workers.

JD.com and Alibaba declined to say whether they have raised the evictions with the Beijing government. Alibaba says it is coordinating with its logistics partners to help affected workers and their families with temporary housing and other support and says its logistics affiliate hasn’t experienced any “significant disruption” to its service.

‘Everybody understands that the government is in charge in China. Companies don’t want to cause trouble.’ —Liu Yang, who went to Beijing this year to look for a programmer job

Anecdotally, services have been affected. Several shop owners at Alibaba’s Taobao Marketplace told me that some delivery companies are refusing to ship to Beijing because local couriers are in short supply and some warehouses are being closed. Taobao customers in the city complain of slower service and higher delivery fees.

The tech giants know they rely on migrant labor. In a social-media post on Monday, Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma thanked what he said were the three million couriers who delivered a billion parcels after the Nov. 11 online shopping extravaganza that is China’s equivalent of Cyber Monday. Behind the “miracle” of China’s delivery-service industry, he wrote, are the couriers “who work on windy and rainy days.”

JD.com founder and Chief Executive Richard Liu always refers to the company’s more than 65,000 delivery workers as “brothers” because, he told me two years ago, he wants to show them respect.

Mr. Liu, who was born in a poor village in eastern China, went to university in Beijing with money donated from neighbors. He told me that JD couriers with a few years of experience can make over $1,200 a month in Beijing, plus full benefits. That is considered good pay for blue-collar workers.

Migrants my colleagues and I spoke to this week aren’t expecting help. Some see in the government’s power a leveling effect on big companies.

“They’re just ordinary citizens like us,” says Nathan Wang, who works on user engagement at a Beijing-based internet startup. He is worried that his unheated studio apartment might be next to be torn down.

"Score another kill for the Cuban military dictatorship: Last month it eliminated Afro-Cuban dissident Hamell Santiago Más Hernández, an inmate of one of its most notoriously brutal prisons.

The remarkable thing was not the death of a critic. That’s routine in a police state that holds all the guns, bayonets, money and food. What’s noteworthy is that the world hardly blinked, which is to say that two years after President Obama’s detente with Raúl Castro, the regime still dispatches adversaries with impunity. It also routinely blocks visitors to the island, even of the leftist stripe—more on this in a moment—in order to keep the population isolated. “Normalization” to the contrary, Cuba is the same totalitarian hellhole that it has been for the past 58 years.

Forty-five-year-old Más Hernández was a member of the Patriotic Union of Cuba, a group working for a peaceful transition to democracy. He was healthy when he was arrested in June and sentenced to four years in prison for “disrespect for authority”—a k a failure to bow to the masters of the slave plantation. His real crime was advocating for a free Cuba while black. There are few more lethal combinations.

The black Cuban is supposed to show gratitude to the revolution to sustain the myth that he has been elevated by communism. The grim reality is the opposite, but heaven help those who dare to say so.

In November, Más Hernández was transferred to Combinado del Este prison, a dungeon not fit for animals. There he developed a kidney infection. His wife told the independent media in Cuba that he lost almost 35 pounds. According to his overlords he died on Feb. 24 of a “heart attack.” Funny, that epidemic of heart disease among those who cross Castro.

His death ought to prick the conscience of the free world. But while the island is crawling with foreign news bureaus, the story has not appeared in the English-language press. President Obama may have opened Cuba to more tourists, but the regime takes pains to keep its 11 million captive souls and their misery invisible.

The Castro family is a crime syndicate and many American businesses want a piece of the action. Sheraton Four Points now runs a hotel owned by the military regime. The luggage company Tumi spent the winter promoting Cuba travel on its website. (Note to self: Buy that new suitcase from someone who isn’t blind to tyranny.) The upshot is that more U.S. dollars flow to Cuba’s military coffers than ever before.

Mr. Obama argued that more contact with outsiders would empower Cubans. The regime agrees. It has been open to foreign tourism and investment since the end of Soviet subsidies in the early 1990s, and millions of Europeans, Latin Americans and Asians have flooded the country. But its secret police keep a tight leash on visitors.

British real-estate developer Stephen Purvis, Canadian businessmen Cy Tokmakjian and Sarkis Yacoubian and U.S. Agency for International Development contractor Alan Gross all did time in Cuban jails for being too independent of the mob boss.

Last month Castro took the audacious step of refusing visas to three prominent Latin American politicians who could hardly be regarded as enemies of Cuba.

Organization of American States Secretary-General Luis Almagro was invited to Cuba by Rosa María Payá. She is the daughter of the late Cuban dissident Oswaldo Payá, who was killed in a suspicious car accident in the summer of 2012. Mr. Almagro was slated to receive an award named for Ms. Payá’s father from the Latin America Youth Network for Democracy. But Mr. Almagro, who is a Uruguayan leftist, was denied entry to the island.

The regime also blocked Mariana Aylwin, the daughter of Patricio Aylwin, the first elected Chilean president post-Pinochet. Ms. Aylwin is a Christian Democrat and a former education minister and was to accept a posthumous award for her late father. She remains an important voice in the Chilean Christian Democrat Party, which is a member, with the Communist Party among others, of the governing coalition.

Ms. Payá also invited former Mexican President Felipe Calderón to the event. Mr. Calderón is a member of Mexico’s center-right PAN, but as head of state he was friendly toward Cuba. One memorable moment was when he welcomed Raúl at the Rio Group summit on the Mayan Riviera in 2010 at a time when Orlando Zapata, another black Cuban dissident, lay dying in a military prison. Mr. Calderón was also denied a visa.

Cuba is not reforming. As always, dissidents are sent to prison death traps, and now Castro insults highly placed onetime friends by refusing them access to the island. Tourists are welcome, but only to drink state propaganda and leave behind hard currency. Any suggestion that Cubans have a right to self-determination remains a crime against the state.

"WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump is consulting with advisers about whom he should tap as his next chief of staff, with John Kelly expected to depart the administration as early as this summer, possibly soon, according to people familiar with the matter.

The two front-runners for the job, the people said, are Nick Ayers, who serves as chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, and Mick Mulvaney, who heads the Office of Management and Budget as well as serving as acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Mr. Mulvaney dined with the president Wednesday evening, and Mr. Trump discussed the chief of staff position with him, according to a person familiar with the conversation.

Plans for Mr. Kelly’s exit aren’t final, the people said. Other aides have fallen out of favor with the president yet held on to jobs longer than expected as Mr. Trump gets more feedback on their performance.

The White House, asked about Mr. Kelly’s status, initially declined to comment. Later Thursday, after The Wall Street Journal report appeared online, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the president called the article “fake news” and that Mr. Kelly said “this was news to him.”

Mr. Kelly has told colleagues he doesn’t intend to stay in the role beyond his one-year mark, which is July 31. People close to the White House said that departure could come as early as this week or could follow the president’s mid-July trip to Europe, where he will attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit and meet with the leaders of the U.K. and Russia.

Newsletter Sign-up

One person close to the White House said Mr. Kelly doesn’t believe he can serve Mr. Trump well because the president has stopped listening to him. This person said Mr. Kelly no longer likes the job and doesn’t believe the president genuinely wants a chief of staff.

A complication is the Supreme Court vacancy created by Anthony Kennedy’s departure. Mr. Trump may need Mr. Kelly to help recruit, vet and shepherd through a Supreme Court nomination, this person said.

Mr. Kelly, a 68-year-old retired Marine general, came into the job with a mandate to impose discipline in a West Wing where many aides had easy access to the president and felt free to pursue policy initiatives that hadn’t been fully vetted. But in recent months, Mr. Kelly’s grip on West Wing operations has loosened. Some senior aides now report directly to the president, a departure from an early practice in which Mr. Kelly was the principal gatekeeper to the Oval Office.

The president has asked several advisers what they think about Mr. Kelly and how long he should stay in the role, said people familiar with the matter. Mr. Kelly’s predecessor, Reince Priebus, stayed on the job for six months.

Mr. Kelly traveled with the president this week to North Dakota and Wisconsin for a campaign rally, a fundraiser and a visit to a technology plant.

Some veterans of the Trump White House say the president chafes under the sort of hierarchical structure that Mr. Kelly sought to create, preferring to consult with friends and associates on his own timetable.

Steve Bannon, a former White House chief strategist, said that when Mr. Trump ran his real-estate business from Trump Tower, he had “no hierarchy” and a half-dozen people reporting to him directly.

“It’s been very obvious for the last four or five months that President Trump has run the White House with an organizational structure that has left Kelly in a ceremonial position,” Mr. Bannon said. “That’s the structure he’s most comfortable with and it’s coincided with some of his greatest accomplishments on trade, North Korea, and the economy. I would anticipate with Kelly’s departure that he would go with a structure where a chief of staff would only play a ceremonial role, if he appoints one at all,” he added. “That’s the structure that fits him best.”

The departure of Mr. Kelly, who served as Mr. Trump’s homeland security secretary before taking over for Mr. Priebus, could trigger more resignations as people loyal to him leave. That would accelerate what has already been record turnover at senior levels of the White House.

A year and a half into his presidency, Mr. Trump has presided over the highest turnover of any recent president at a comparable point, according to Martha Joynt Kumar, emeritus professor of political science at Towson University. Some 61% of people who held the rank of assistant to the president under Mr. Trump have left the job, versus 14% under Barack Obama, 5% for George W. Bush, 42% for Bill Clinton, 19% for George H.W. Bush and 29% for Ronald Reagan at this point in their administrations, according to Ms. Kumar’s research.

The discussions about a new chief of staff come as Mr. Trump prepares to fill another key administration role: communications adviser. The president on Wednesday met with former Fox News executive Bill Shine about heading that department, a job that has been left empty since longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks left the administration in March, people familiar with the meeting said.

Mr. Shine has expressed interest in the role, though he may serve as an adviser rather than take the formal role of communications director, the people said. A White House announcement is expected in the coming days.

Mr. Ayers has served as the vice president’s chief of staff for nearly a year, sworn in on the same day that Mr. Trump said he was tapping Mr. Kelly for the role. A longtime adviser to Mr. Pence, Mr. Ayers has at times clashed with senior advisers in the West Wing, who have accused him of trying to undercut the president, according to people familiar with the matter. Asked about the potential discord Mr. Ayers’s appointment could bring to the West Wing, one person close to the White House replied: “Whose problem is that?”

Mr. Mulvaney’s name has often been mentioned for the chief of staff job, and the former congressman was a contender for the position last summer, too, before Mr. Trump tapped Mr. Kelly.

“Mick serves at the pleasure of the president and is focused on his two full-time jobs. He does not have time for rumors, especially from unnamed sources,” an administrative official said.

Mr. Kelly’s departure would follow months of friction between him and the president, although both sought to tamp down speculation that Mr. Trump would appoint another chief of staff. Mr. Kelly has frequently complained about his job and working in the White House, including in a recent meeting with lawmakers.

At a Medal of Honor ceremony on Tuesday, the president singled out his chief of staff as a “special guy” but also cracked a joke about his age. As he touted the Medal of Honor recipient’s efforts during the 1945 Battle of the Bulge, Mr. Trump interrupted his speech—“That was a tough one, right?…Kelly was there.”

One person close to the White House took note of that moment, casting it as a message that Mr. Trump would like someone younger in the job.

While Mr. Trump bristled over Mr. Kelly’s protocols, some aides and friends found loopholes to get around the system, at times calling first lady Melania Trump and asking her to pass messages to her husband, according to people familiar with the matter.

The relationship hit a rough patch earlier this year, when Mr. Trump privately criticized his chief of staff for the handling of accusations of domestic assault against former staff secretary Rob Porter, who resigned in February after graphic photos emerged of the alleged abuse.

Mr. Kelly had initially defended Mr. Porter, vouching for his integrity publicly and privately. In his own public comments on the matter, Mr. Trump emphasized Mr. Porter’s denial of abuse without addressing his staff’s handling of the matter.

In March, shortly after Mr. Trump fired secretary of state Rex Tillerson, Mr. Kelly left aides with the impression that he might be next to be pushed out and that they should start looking for new jobs. But by the end of the week, the two had reached a truce, and Mr. Trump told advisers afterward that Mr. Kelly was “100% safe.”

Minnesota politicians have a tradition of deferring to candidates who have won the endorsement of their state parties, but in 2018 the endorsed candidates in each major party are expected to lose.

Minnesota Democrats picked state Rep. Erin Murphy at their state convention in June, but that did little to slow the gubernatorial campaigns of state Attorney General Lori Swanson and Rep. Tim Walz.

Mr. Walz, a former schoolteacher, has campaigned on improving the state’s public schools. Ms. Swanson, who entered the race after Ms. Murphy won the party’s endorsement, has in the campaign’s final days attacked Mr. Walz for missing votes in Congress to run for governor.

Mr. Walz hasn’t addressed his primary opponents in his TV ads, instead focusing his attacks on Tim Pawlenty, the former Republican governor vying for a comeback.

Mr. Pawlenty is running without the backing of the state GOP, which endorsed Jeff Johnson, a county commissioner who has campaigned as a Trump ally. He’s called for “draining the swamp” in St. Paul and highlighted Mr. Pawlenty’s disavowal of the president following the October 2016 release of the “Access Hollywood” video in which the president was heard making lewd remarks about women.

Mr. Pawlenty, who served two terms as governor and briefly ran for president in 2012, has, along with his allied super PAC, spent about three times more than Mr. Johnson on radio and television advertising.

In Minnesota’s Democratic Senate primary, incumbent Sen. Tina Smith, who was appointed to succeed Al Franken following his resignation, is widely expected to defeat ethics watchdog Richard Painter.

Mr. Painter, a former official in the George W. Bush White House, has raised little money and has defined himself as a “centrist.” That hasn’t galvanized Democratic support.

Connecticut

Connecticut presents the most likely opportunity for Republicans to flip a Democratic-held governor’s seat, with Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy, who is not seeking a third term in Hartford.

The state’s Republicans will choose between business executives Bob Stefanowski and David Stemerman, Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton and Tim Herbst, the first selectman of Trumbull. Steve Obsitnik, an entrepreneur, is also running in the GOP primary.

Each of the five are running as allies of Mr. Trump, though the primary campaign has featured an array of TV ads questioning individual candidates’ loyalty to the president. During a July televised debate, each of the candidates gave Mr. Trump an “A” grade for his first 18 months in office.

Mr. Boughton, who was the party’s 2010 nominee for lieutenant governor and ran for governor in 2014 but dropped out before the primary, has the endorsement of the state GOP. Linda McMahon, the administrator of the Small Business Administration, contributed to a super PAC backing Mr. Boughton.

The Democratic nominee is expected to be Ned Lamont, who defeated Sen. Joe Lieberman in a 2006 Democratic Senate primary but lost when Mr. Lieberman ran as a third-party candidate in the general election.

Vermont

Vermont Democrats are poised to make Christine Hallquist the nation’s first major party transgender nominee for governor.

Ms. Hallquist, who led a local utility co-op, has campaigned on rural economic development and environmental issues. She faces James Ehlers, an environmentalist; Brenda Siegel, the director of a local dance festival; and Ethan Sonneborn, a 14-year-old whose website asks of his campaign, “Is this legal?”

(The answer is yes. The Vermont constitution requires only that governors have lived in the state for four years before being elected.)

The winner will face moderate Republican Phil Scott, who is considered a heavy favorite to win a second term.

"A woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were teenagers went public with her name for the first time on Sunday, injecting immediate uncertainty into Republicans’ push to quickly confirm the next high-court justice.

The public allegation by the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, in an article published by the Washington Post Sunday, threatened to alter the trajectory of a confirmation process that has been heading toward a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. A spokesman for the committee’s chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), said Sunday that the vote would proceed as scheduled, but hours later, Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.), who sits on the committee, said he wouldn’t vote for Judge Kavanaugh to advance to the full Senate until the committee had heard from Mrs. Ford.

“I would not vote yes until we hear more from the woman who’s come forward,” Mr. Flake said in an interview. With Republicans holding just a one-vote majority on the committee, a defection by Mr. Flake would prevent the panel from favorably advancing Judge Kavanaugh to the full Senate, where the GOP has a 51-49 majority. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) told Politico he also supported delaying the vote to hear from Mrs. Ford, while Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) told CNN she was discussing the matter with colleagues.

Mrs. Ford, in the Post article, said that when she and Judge Kavanaugh were teenagers at a party in the Washington, D.C., area, he and a friend pulled her into a bedroom. Judge Kavanaugh pinned her down on the bed, groped her and attempted to remove her clothing before she escaped, Mrs. Ford said in the article.

Mrs. Ford, who is a professor at Palo Alto University in California, described the episode as aggressive. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” she told the Post.

Judge Kavanaugh, 53 years old, denied the assertions when they began to surface, without the accuser’s name, last week. “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,” Judge Kavanaugh said in a statement released through the White House. “I did not do this back in high school or at any time.”

Efforts to reach Mrs. Ford weren’t successful. The White House didn’t change its stance after she came forward.

“On Friday, Judge Kavanaugh ‘categorically and unequivocally’ denied this allegation. This has not changed,” White House spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement Sunday. “Judge Kavanaugh and the White House both stand by that statement.”

It is unclear whether Mrs. Ford would testify before the committee, either in private or in public.

The outlines of Mrs. Ford’s allegation emerged publicly several days ago when Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she had reported a matter involving Judge Kavanaugh to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mrs. Feinstein didn’t initially name Mrs. Ford, saying the individual had requested confidentiality.

On Sunday, Mrs. Feinstein confirmed in a statement that Mrs. Ford was the person who had made the allegations.

“I support Mrs. Ford’s decision to share her story, and now that she has, it is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation,” Mrs. Feinstein said. “This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nominee.”

Mr. Flake, in his interview Sunday evening, added, “We said before that these allegations were anonymous and uncorroborated. That is no longer true.” Mr. Flake, who is retiring after this term, has occasionally criticized President Trump.

Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on Mr. Grassley to delay the panel’s vote. Democrats have pushed for weeks for a slower process, saying many documents relevant to Judge Kavanaugh’s background hadn’t been released.

Any slowdown of the Kavanaugh nomination would be a bitter pill for a Republican leadership that has banked on a swift confirmation to install him before the next court session begins in early October and safely ahead of November’s midterm elections. Judge Kavanaugh, nominated in July to succeed the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, is expected to shift the balance of the court further to the right, making his confirmation fight particularly high-stakes.

Taylor Foy, the Grassley spokesman, said earlier Sunday that Democrats should have brought the allegations to the Judiciary Committee earlier. Mrs. Feinstein has said she didn’t raise the matter earlier because Mrs. Ford was hesitant to come forward.

The judge has been expected to be approved on a party-line vote in the GOP-controlled Judiciary Committee. In the full Senate, he would need a simple majority to be confirmed. There, Mrs. Ford’s decision to speak publicly is likely to focus more attention on the two GOP senators whom Democrats have targeted as most likely to defect in a floor vote on Judge Kavanaugh: Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

Neither senator has raised serious concerns about Judge Kavanaugh, but both are strong supporters of women’s rights who Democrats believe might support a delay in the confirmation process.

The offices of Sens. Collins and Murkowski didn’t respond to a request for comment Sunday.

Mrs. Ford is a research psychologist at Palo Alto, where she teaches in consortium with Stanford University. A university spokeswoman didn’t reply to requests for more information.

She graduated from the all-girls Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Md., not far from the Georgetown Preparatory School Mr. Kavanaugh attended. A 2014 edition of Holton-Arms’ alumni magazine says Mrs. Ford is a professor of psychology and statistics and worked at Stanford since 1988. She was among thousands of mental-health professionals and researchers who signed onto a Physicians for Human Rights letter to the Trump administration in June denouncing the administration’s immigration policy that caused family separations at the U.S. border, according to a copy of the letter.

She also works as a biostatistician and has co-written more than 50 scientific books and publications, the alumni magazine said, noting that she is an “avid surfer, and she and her family spend a great deal of time surfing in the Santa Cruz and San Francisco areas.”

Mrs. Ford’s papers cover topics such as the relationship between childhood abuse and neglect and adult depression; post-traumatic growth after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001; and whether acupuncture is a useful treatment for depression during pregnancy.

Mrs. Ford, using her professional name, Christine Blasey, has made three donations since January 2017 totaling $42 to Act Blue, an online service that provides a one-stop donation platform used by Democrats seeking office.

Mrs. Ford provided several previously unreported details to the Post, saying she had discussed the alleged incident in 2012 when she and her husband, Russell Biddle Ford, were in couples therapy.

The therapist saved her notes, which describe Mrs. Ford recounting being assaulted by students “from an elitist boys’ school,” but didn’t name Judge Kavanaugh, the article said.

The therapist also noted that there were four boys involved, which, Mrs. Ford said in the Post interview, was the therapist’s error.

Mrs. Ford said she didn’t tell anyone about the incident at the time, worried that she would get in trouble with her parents for being at a party where teenagers were drinking. But she told the Post that the alleged assault had damaged her, hindered her ability to have healthy relationships with men and contributed to long-term anxiety issues.

Mrs. Ford also took a polygraph test administered by a former FBI agent and provided the results to the Post, which the newspaper said indicated she was being truthful when she said a statement summarizing her allegations was accurate.

"The new allied deterrent force for the Baltic region will be in place by May 2017, with some units arriving earlier, the head of the Western alliance’s military committee said Sunday.

Military leaders from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, gathering in Split, Croatia, this weekend, discussed the deployment of the force of up to 4,000 personnel, its rules of engagement, and its command and control.

Czech Army Gen. Petr Pavel, who leads the NATO military committee, said the battle groups will be arriving at different times in the first half of 2017. The U.S. force, of about 1,000 soldiers, will come from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment based in Vilseck, Germany, and is due to arrive in Poland by April, U.S. officials said.

In its July summit in Warsaw, NATO approved a new multinational force to be stationed in Poland and the Baltic states, aimed at deterring Russian aggression in the region. Eastern European allies have been worried about the possibility of a rising threat from Russia since Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

In Croatia, the NATO chiefs of defense—including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford—discussed the rules of engagement the force would operate under. The rules will differ by each country, reflecting differences in the situation and agreements with the host nations.

While Gen. Pavel wouldn't outline the rules, he said they would be altered from those the current international forces in the region are operating under, designed to allow the new NATO forces to move from a peacetime footing to a crisis situation rapidly.

“With these four battle groups, we are not talking about exclusively about a training presence,” he said. “This force is to serve as a deterrent and if necessary as a fighting force. The rules will be different.”

Some of the troops participating in the deterrent force—both from the NATO contributing countries and the host nations—have been training at the U.S. Army facility in Grafenwoehr, Germany. Forces have been dusting off Cold War-era knowledge about defenses, as well as studying the electronic warfare techniques used by Russian-backed forces in Ukraine.

NATO military leaders will present proposals for the command of the new units at a gathering of alliance defense ministers in October, Gen. Pavel said.

Gen. Pavel said the new NATO force in the Baltic is likely to be overseen by a Polish division headquarters that is supplemented by international officers. U.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the top NATO commander, will have ultimate control of the new NATO force.

In addition to the U.S. battalion in Poland, Germany will send forces to Lithuania, Canada will send troops to Latvia and the British will have a battle group in Estonia. Other nations, including Norway, Denmark and France are supplementing those forces.

“There are many strands of work,” Gen. Pavel said. “We are trying to come up with the big picture so we are assured the measures we are taking are well coordinated, mutually supportive and we are not working in different directions.”

"DAEJEON, South Korea—Three South Koreans illegally imported North Korean coal and iron via Russia in violation of sanctions, South Korean customs officials said, exposing a crack in the U.S.-led campaign to cut off trade with the Pyongyang regime.

Using forged customs documents and facilitating payments through a shell company in Hong Kong, the individuals brought in over 35,000 tons of coal and pig iron worth almost $6 million from North Korea between April and October last year, South Korean customs authorities told reporters Friday.

The suspects appeared to have tried to profit by selling the cheaper North Korean products at much higher prices in South Korea, the officials said, without identifying the companies or individuals involved. The customs agency said it would recommend indicting three individuals and their companies—two coal importers and one transportation firm—on charges of smuggling, illicit importation, and forgery.

As North Korea’s expanding nuclear program increased tensions last year, the U.S. led a global push to isolate the regime through economic sanctions intended to cut off its trade in raw materials such as coal, oil, iron and lead.

But the sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council haven’t been watertight. Aerial surveillance and satellite imagery have found North Korean vessels receiving oil via ship-to-ship transfers on the high seas, while ships believed to be aiding North Korea have been seen delivering coal to ports in Russia and Vietnam.

Friday’s announcement came after a 10-month investigation by South Korean authorities that began when they received what a senior customs official said was U.S. intelligence information.

The coal and iron were delivered through seven shipments on vessels that now bear the flags of North Korea, Belize, Kiribati, and Hong Kong, according to MarineTraffic, a ship-tracking website.

The coal was loaded at the North Korean ports of Songlim, Wonsan, Chongjin, and Daean, and shipped to the Russian ports of Nakhodka, Vladivostok, and Kholmsk, investigators found. It was then shipped to five different South Korean ports.

Cargo bills uncovered in raids on the companies provided evidence of the shipments from North Korea to Russian ports, the South Korean authorities said, adding that one of the suspects later acknowledged the coal and iron was sent on to South Korea.

Some of the imported coal was consumed by Korea South-East Power Co., a subsidiary of the country’s largest utility company, according to customs officials. But authorities said they wouldn’t press charges on the company, as it appears the government-run firm, known as KOEN, consumed the North Korean coal unknowingly.

When reached for comment, a spokesman for KOEN referred to customs officials’ earlier findings that the company had committed no illegal act.

The episode shows how North Korea has sought to evade sanctions through transshipments of raw materials that could provide a much-needed financial lifeline to the regime of leader Kim Jong Un.

The sanctions are thought to have contributed to the largest contraction in North Korea’s gross domestic product in two decades, according to a recent South Korean central bank analysis.

A thaw in relations between North and South in recent months, though, has prompted calls in some quarters for an easing of pressure.

President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has sought to revive economic projects with North Korea, such as reconnecting rail lines and roads, and reopening factories and a tourist attraction north of the border. But officials have said those moves are unlikely to make progress while sanctions remain in place.

"BEALE AIR FORCE BASE, Calif.—Six decades after the U-2 flew its first mission, the military is trying to harness artificial-intelligence technology to enhance the venerable spy plane’s combat reconnaissance capabilities.

U.S. Air Force reconnaissance experts have enlisted Stanford University engineering and business students to develop advanced computer programs to analyze the old-style Kodak film currently used by U-2s over Afghanistan, Iraq, Korea, Syria and other hot zones.

The U-2 spy plane has been in service for more than 60 years and still flies missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. WSJ's Michael Phillips got a rare opportunity to fly to the edge of space and explore why America's oldest working spy plane is still soaring above 70,000 feet.

If successful, computers would quickly scan miles of U-2 film and count cars, airplanes, motorcycles, buildings and even individual people, tasks now performed painstakingly by analysts using eye loupes and illuminated screens.

“Our analysts are already saturated with data—too much imagery, too few analysts, and too little time,” says U.S. Air Force Col. Jason Brown, commander of the 480th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing. “Imagine if an algorithm could sweep through the data to cue analysts on potential areas of concern. Airmen could spend less time searching and more time making sense of the things they see.”

The U-2 spy plane first became operational in 1956 under the aegis of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Air Force U-2 operations began the following year. In 1960, U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down while taking photographs over the Soviet Union, sparking an international incident. In 1962, U.S. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson unveiled U-2 images at the United Nations to prove the Soviets had installed missiles in Cuba.

Six decades later, updated U-2 planes—part of a 30-plane fleet now flown by U.S. Air Force pilots—conduct combat missions over Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, as well as performing humanitarian surveillance. The planes brought back images of floodwaters unleashed by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 and of damage caused by the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

U-2s can carry modern electronic sensors—infrared or electro-optical devices, for instance—mostly used when analysts know roughly where their quarry is located.

But wet-film cameras still outperform other surveillance gear by delivering crisp images from above 70,000 feet, where the pilot can see land for 250 miles in any direction. The cameras can distinguish objects just 8 inches apart, providing sufficient clarity for analysts to read the identification numbers on the wing of a parked airplane or count the number of people at a camp.

“You can cover almost all of California in four hours,” says one senior U-2 pilot, who goes by the call-sign Sharkey. “It maps the entire terrain.”

U-2s photograph all of Afghanistan every month or so.

A typical flight generates a 200-pound, two-mile-long roll of film, which is shipped by FedEx to Beale Air Force Base. Technicians there develop the film, and analysts search for information that could prove useful for longer-term military planning.

Given time and staff constraints, however, humans can read only about 5% of the images the spy planes capture. “If you’ve got the whole state of California, how do you look at all those images?” says Command Master Sgt. Ian Eishen, of the Air Force’s 9th Intelligence Squadron. “You don’t.”

The Air Force is hoping that computers can learn to scan digitized images of the wet film and identify and count cars, trucks, boats, planes, motorcycles, buildings and people on the ground below.

If the artificial-intelligence effort is successful, for instance, the computer could spot and measure an increase in activity in a particular area, freeing up human analysts to think about whether that activity constitutes a threat to allied ground forces or an opportunity for offensive action.

Even from an altitude above 70,000 feet, the U-2’s cameras and film produce images with enough clarity to read identification numbers on the wing of a parked airplane or count the number of people at a camp. Photo: Michael M. Phillips/The Wall Street Journal

“Now the analyst can figure out why” the activity is taking place, says Sgt. Eishen.

Images taken by advanced digital sensors are usually classified. The U-2’s film camera isn’t classified, and neither are the pictures it takes. That allows the Air Force to share them with engineering students, even those from foreign countries.

This spring, Stanford students working with Air Force experts developed a prototype of an automated system to read the U-2 imagery, through a class called Hacking 4 Defense. The Air Force expects to test the system in the coming months.

The defense class is now offered at 11 universities, from Georgetown to Boise State, and each group of students undertakes its own defense-related technology challenge. Students at the University of Southern California are working on artificial-intelligence technology to identify roadside booby-traps, such as the ones that have devastated U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“The U-2 problem is very similar: How do you use artificial intelligence to look at a massive amount of data and identify objects?” says Pete Newell, a retired Army colonel who teaches the course at Stanford.

"The victory of Kara Eastman over former Rep. Brad Ashford, the Democratic Party establishment’s favored candidate in a Nebraska primary Tuesday, has left the party at risk of being less competitive in a district that may be key to winning a majority in the House of Representatives in November.

Her upset win in an Omaha House district underscores the limits of often-cautious Democratic Party leaders’ influence in primary elections at a time when their voters and liberal grass-roots activists are hungry for a more confrontational approach.

Ms. Eastman, a 46-year-old nonprofit executive, campaigned on instituting a single-payer health-care system. In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting massacre last October, she told the Omaha World-Herald that Congress should consider a constitutional amendment “to define what bearing arms means” under the Second Amendment.

On Wednesday, Ms. Eastman said in an interview that she is for “common-sense gun-safety laws” including banning assault weapons and instituting background checks for new gun purchases. She said she didn’t recall proposing changing the Constitution to limit the Second Amendment.

“I’ve given a lot of interviews and I don’t remember that one,” she said.

Her bold positioning was a contrast to Mr. Ashford, a centrist who was on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s “Red-to-Blue” list of endorsed candidates. The DCCC has also been subsidizing two Nebraska Democratic Party staffers in a bid to boost voter turnout in the district.

Officials from both parties say Mr. Ashford’s defeat likely makes a Democratic victory in Nebraska against first-term GOP Rep. Don Bacon—who ousted Mr. Ashford in 2016—more difficult for Democrats.

“Kara Eastman is going to have to convince the voters that even though she may be more liberal than the district that it doesn’t really matter,” Mr. Ashford said. “What really matters is the inability of the Republican majority and the president to solve the problems that are affecting people.”

Mr. Ashford, who served a single term in Congress before losing a 2016 re-election bid to Mr. Bacon, said Wednesday that Democratic primary voters rejected his centrist message.

“If you’re mad about government, you can yell and scream but in the end we can fix it,” Mr. Ashford said. “That can only be done in the center. It can’t be done on the extremes.”

Republicans in Washington celebrated the Nebraska result. The National Republican Congressional Committee released polling showing Mr. Bacon with a 10-percentage point lead over Ms. Eastman. Mr. Bacon led Mr. Ashford by two points in a hypothetical matchup, the NRCC polls showed.

The DCCC hasn’t polled the Eastman-Bacon matchup, an official said.

Mr. Bacon said Wednesday it is “hard for me to say” whether Ms. Eastman’s primary victory makes his general election path easier.

“She’s too far to the left, but she’s going to bring some enthusiasm from her base” that Mr. Ashford wouldn’t, Mr. Bacon said.

Ms. Eastman rejected the idea that she is too liberal for the district.

“I’ve run on messages that I believe in and that I know represent the values of the people in the district,” she said. “The idea of providing health care for everybody, we can afford it. … And that’s what the people at the doors have told me they want.”

"Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim nation, has long stood as a role model for religious pluralism. That’s changing. Political Islam and violent extremism have been taking root in society and may soon do so in the government. President Joko Widodo’s choice of Ma’ruf Amin, a 75-year-old cleric, as his running mate in next year’s election marks an ugly turn for Indonesian politics.

Religious minorities had regarded Mr. Widodo as their defender. His rival, retired general Prabowo Subianto, was expected to play the religion card, questioning the incumbent’s Islamic credentials and building a coalition supported by radical Islamists. By choosing Mr. Amin, the president’s defenders argue, he not only has neutralized the religion factor, but might have prevented it from spilling over into violence against minorities. In office, they believe, Mr. Amin will be contained.

Yet Mr. Subianto is unlikely to be deterred from playing identity politics, and rumors that Mr. Amin is reaching out to radical Islamists for support are troubling. Mr. Amin has a history of intolerance. He signed a fatwa that put a Widodo ally, Jakarta’s former Gov. Basuki Tjahaja “Ahok” Purnama, in jail on blasphemy charges. Ahok, who is Christian and ethnically Chinese, was a symbol of Indonesia’s diversity, and as a popular governor was expected to be re-elected. Instead he lost after rivals told Muslims not to vote for a non-Muslim.

Mr. Amin also signed the anti-Ahmadiyya fatwa in 2005, which led to severe restrictions and violence against the Ahmadiyya, an Islamic sect some Muslims regard as heretical. I met recently with Ahmadis in Depok, a Jakarta suburb, where their mosque is closed. The previous week they were visited by 15 local officials ordering them to stop all activities.

Mr. Amin has been behind other repressive measures, including restrictions on the construction of places of worship, proposals to criminalize homosexuality, support for female genital mutilation and local Shariah laws.

Indonesia’s pluralism has come under increasing threat. Local authorities, under pressure from Islamic extremists, forced hundreds of churches to close. While there have been few closures since Mr. Widodo took office, the Rev. Gomar Gultom, general secretary of Indonesia’s Communion of Churches, says “there has been no justice for old cases.” Authorities continue to misuse blasphemy laws. A Buddhist woman in North Sumatra was jailed for 18 months for asking a mosque to turn down the volume on its loudspeakers.

Last month a foreign scholar who has lived in Indonesia for more than half a century told me of a Muslim man who asked his 12-year-old son what he had learned at school one day. “We learned about kafir”—infidels—his son replied. When the father asked what they had learned, the boy replied: “We learned that they must be killed.”

Last year, in Yogyakarta, a Christian man told me his 15-year-old daughter’s best friend, a Muslim, had told her that they could no longer be friends: “After Ahok’s case, my God does not allow me to be friends with people like you.”

These anecdotes are reinforced by news footage that shows marching children at a kindergarten in east Java, dressed in black robes and face veils, wielding realistic-looking toy rifles, with the theme “Fight with the Messenger of Allah to Increase Faith and Piety.” As Mr. Gultom told me, “The seed of radicalization has spread throughout Indonesia.”

Religious intolerance and terrorism aren’t the same, but as the Wahid Foundation’s Alamsyah M. Djafar told me, “if intolerance increases, the threat of radicalism increases, and that will change the face of Indonesia.” And on May 13 a family of suicide bombers attacked three churches in Surabaya within minutes of each other. The parents strapped explosives onto their daughters, 6 and 8, and their teenage sons. At least 13 people were killed.

Three months later, I visited all three churches. I heard two key messages, which offer some hope for Indonesia. The first was from the victims, and can be summed up in one word: forgiveness. Father Aloysius Widyawan, a priest at Santa Maria Tak Bercela Catholic Church, told me that the consistent message from his parishioners was: “We must love others, we forgive the attackers, we do not want revenge.” One woman who lost two sons, 8 and 12, in the attacks, said: “I have already forgiven the bombers. I don’t want to cry anymore. I know that our Mother Mary also lost her son, Jesus. I forgive.”

The second message was from Muslims who reject extremism. Within hours of the bombings, they came to clear up the wreckage. At Jakarta’s cathedral that evening, two Muslim women arrived at Mass, offering red and white roses, the colors of Indonesia’s flag.

President Trump’s administration has made the promotion of international religious freedom a priority. If it is serious, the U.S. should work to strengthen the voices of moderate Indonesian Muslims. At the same time, Indonesian politicians whose heart is with the defenders of pluralism must stop playing identity politics and stand up to the preachers of hate. If they don’t, Indonesia’s pluralism is in increasing peril, which will have grave consequences beyond Southeast Asia.

"A deal to create a demilitarized zone in Syria’s last opposition stronghold and forestall a regime offensive faces an immediate challenge from terrorist groups there who have signaled their reluctance to abide by the agreement.

Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, one of the most powerful armed groups in Syria’s Idlib Province, criticized the accord made this week between Russia and Turkey to avert a government offensive. The deal for a demilitarized zone would remove heavy weapons and expel officially designated terrorist groups from a 10-to-12 mile corridor along the front lines by mid-October.

Area of control Kurds Syrian regime Opposition Proposed demilitarized zone TURKEY Antioch Aleppo Idlib Latakia Detail SYRIA SYRIA 10 miles Hamah 10 km

Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which evolved from the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, sees the plan as a plot to weaken opposition to President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. It also suggested that abandoning its weapons would be un-Islamic.

“A lot of provisions fall directly in the interest of the murderous regime in Damascus,” said the group, known as HTS, through a statement posted by its media arm. “It also entails provisions that deny the revolution’s principles and call for the weakening of the revolution and the jihadists through a plan to disarm them.”

Turkey and Russia, which would patrol the zone to enforce the demilitarization, stand on opposite sides of the conflict. Turkey, which along with the U.S. designates HTS as a terror group, supports some mainstream armed rebel groups and has called for Mr. Assad’s ouster. Russia supports Mr. Assad and since 2015 has helped his regime survive.

Idlib, home to an estimated three million mostly civilians, contains thousands of fighters from groups that Russia, Turkey and the U.S. all consider terrorists. It also is a base for tens of thousands of more moderate anti-Assad fighters supported by Turkey.

Monday’s deal has set off a scramble by rebel commanders to convince HTS and its extremist affiliates to comply with it, several of them said in interviews.

“They are trying to incite fighters from other groups not to hand over their heavy weapons,” said Col. Fateh Hassoun, a former Syrian military officer who is now a commander in a Turkish-backed coalition uniting several rebel factions. “They see this agreement as taking away some of their military abilities and that they will become the target in the next phase.”

For months, Turkey has urged HTS and its allies to disband or face a Turkish-backed rebel attack to eliminate them. Rebel commanders have previously said they have been asked to be ready to take part in such a battle.

But HTS has resisted calls to disband. Complicating matters, it is more than just an armed group. It has administrative control over some parts of Idlib, and recently issued new laws and edicts as it seeks to impose its harsh form of Islam over the civilian population.

The stakes are high for Idlib. The U.N. and other international bodies have warned that an all-out assault could lead to a humanitarian disaster, partly because those displaced would have nowhere to run. Neighbors including Turkey and Jordan already host millions of Syria refugees and now strictly limit their entry.

HTS and its predecessor Nusra Front have had a fraught relationships with more moderate rebels for years. They have sometimes allied with these other rebel groups against the Assad regime and at other times thwarted opposition gains. Their actions have made foreign anti-Assad backers reluctant to support more moderate groups for fear that military and logistical aid could be stolen by the extremists.

The Syrian regime has used the presence of HTS as an excuse to carry out airstrikes and launch assaults even during cease-fire agreements.

"ISLAMABAD—Pakistan’s new government introduced what it called an emergency budget just weeks after coming into office, introducing spending cuts and tax increases to grapple with budget and trade deficits.

The measures announced on Tuesday by Prime Minister Imran Khan’s administration could get Pakistan into better fiscal shape to meet the demands of a possible bailout from the International Monetary Fund, a step expected by many economists.

The government has so far only said that an IMF bailout is among the options it is considering to address the fiscal crunch, which stems from ballooning debt, critically low foreign-exchange reserves and a widening trade imbalance.

The government didn’t introduce a full budget, but what was described by Finance Minister Asad Umar as a package of urgent interim measures that amend the annual budget put in place by the previous government and meant to run until June 2019.

In Pakistan, China and the U.S. are clashing over China’s One Belt, One Road initiative. To understand what’s at stake, it helps to take a look at why China is in Pakistan in the first place.

“All these measures announced today are in line with what the IMF would require. But even if Pakistan isn’t going to the IMF, it would have to fix these issues,” said Tahir Abbas, vice president for investment research at Arif Habib, a Pakistani brokerage.

Mr. Umar announced tax increases and expenditure cuts that he said would slice some 900 billion rupees ($7 billion) off the projected budget deficit. That would reduce the deficit to a projected 5.1% of GDP from 7.2% for the current financial year, he said. Other measures were aimed at resuscitating exports, while extra duties were added to curb imports.

Mr. Umar compared the economy to a critically ill patient. “The economy is in ICU,” he said. “There is no option of ‘wait and see’.”

Foreign-exchange reserves have shrunk so much that they cover less than two months of imports, the finance minister said. Foreign debt swelled over the past five years to almost $95 billion from some $60 billion, he said. The rupee has depreciated by about 20% since late last year.

Mr. Khan, who swept to power in elections to became prime minister on Aug. 18, has promised to establish a welfare state. Mr. Umar said Pakistan’s poorest wouldn’t be hurt by the expenditure cuts and tax increases.

The budget measures include steps to curb tax evasion, expenditure reductions on development projects such as road building, a higher tax rate for those earning over 2.4 million rupees ($19,200) a year, and increased duties on cigarettes, larger cars and smartphones.

Mr. Umar didn’t comment on the possibility of going to the IMF, and left for a trip with Mr. Khan to Saudi Arabia immediately after presenting the new budget measures. Mr. Umar said the Saudi visit would include “discussing trade and investment opportunities.”

He didn’t comment on speculation that Saudi Arabia might provide a large injection of cash to Pakistan. Riyadh provided $1.5 billion at the start of the term of the previous government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

Pakistan needs to raise at least $10 billion in the current fiscal year to bridge the gap between its debt obligations and foreign-exchange reserves, said Mr. Abbas of the Arif Habib brokerage.

Pakistan could go to the IMF, raise money through bond issues, turn to friendly countries—primarily Saudi Arabia or China—or combine these sources, Mr. Abbas said.

An IMF team is due in Pakistan at the end of this month for talks, though the discussions aren’t about a requested loan. Pakistan finished repaying a $6.6 billion IMF loan in 2016.

Mr. Umar said that the $62 billion Chinese investment program in the country would be protected, though Islamabad is making wide-ranging changes to the initiative, away from the big infrastructure construction that has so far been its hallmark. China has also provided Pakistan with several billion dollars in short-term loans in recent years to cover its financial shortfall.

"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is set to meet with President Trump Thursday to discuss “recent news stories,” the White House said Monday, amid conflicting reports about whether Mr. Rosenstein is set to depart.

Mr. Rosenstein visited the White House Monday morning, and people close to him said he expected to be fired. White House chief of staff John Kelly told officials in the West Wing, however, that Mr. Rosenstein resigned during a meeting late last week, a White House official said.

Both sides said conversations about Mr. Rosenstein’s potential departure had unfolded over the weekend.

The development comes after reports last week said Mr. Rosenstein in spring suggested secretly recording President Trump and recruiting cabinet members to remove him from office, according to memos written by former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe.

Mr. Rosenstein, in discussions with friends over the weekend, said the reports that he’d sought the president’s wiretapping or removal were false, and gave no indication he planned to step down, according to people who know him.

In a statement Friday—after the White House urged him to strengthen an earlier denial—Mr Rosenstein said, “I never pursued or authorized recording the President and any suggestion that I have ever advocated for the removal of the President is absolutely false.”

One person in the room when Mr. Rosenstein mentioned secret recordings said that he was clearly sarcastic and didn’t seriously consider it, according to an email from the person provided by the Justice Department on Friday.

Earlier in his tenure, Mr. Rosenstein had a rocky relationship with Mr. Trump, people familiar with the matter said. He was a regular target of Mr. Trump’s complaints about special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into any possible collusion between Moscow and Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign and any possible obstruction of justice.

Mr. Trump, who denies collusion or obstruction, was warned by aides in April against firing Mr. Rosenstein, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Rosenstein appointed Mr. Mueller as special counsel and oversees the Mueller probe.

But in recent months, the relationship between the two men had improved, people familiar with the matter said, as Mr. Rosenstein has regularly visited the White House and navigated sometimes-competing demands from the president and his own department. Mr. Trump last month said his rapport with Mr. Rosenstein was “fantastic.”

Despite the warmer relationship, Democrats have expressed concern that Mr. Trump would try to remove Mr. Rosenstein, given his role as the overseer of the Russia probe.

Mr. Rosenstein routinely briefed the president, including on aspects of the Russia investigation, and has largely tried to satisfy Mr. Trump’s congressional allies, who have demanded increasingly sensitive information about details of the probe.

"The Democratic Party’s political advantage has grown in the home stretch of the midterm campaign, powered by strong support among women and a majority looking for a change from President Trump’s course, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll has found.

Less than two months before Election Day, 52% of registered voters said they would prefer Democrats to control Congress, while 40% preferred Republican control. That 12-point lead expanded from an 8-point Democratic edge in August.

The poll, while outlining challenges for the GOP, included some good news for Republicans. The party is closing an enthusiasm gap, with 61% of Republican voters now expressing high interest in the election, nearly matching the 65% of Democrats. In polls taken over the first eight months of the year, Democrats had held an aggregate 12-point advantage in the share of supporters showing high interest in the election.

The Democratic lead on voter preference for control of Congress is the largest in Journal/NBC polling since Mr. Trump took office. It reflects gains for the party among white, working-class women, as well as among suburban voters and other groups that had been more favorable to the GOP in the past.

Even in congressional districts now represented by Republicans, the poll found that voters favored GOP leadership for the next Congress over Democratic leadership by only a single percentage point.

“Republicans have had a series of weak surveys; this is beyond weak,” said Bill McInturff, the GOP pollster who conducted the survey with Democrat Fred Yang. “This is a survey that says the Republican coalition at the moment is unhinged and not connected.”

Mr. McInturff emphasized that the poll reflected political conditions “at the moment.”

The poll also found that Mr. Trump’s job approval rating remained stable from August, at 44%. The share of voters satisfied with the economy jumped to 69%, up from 63% in a Journal/NBC News poll in June, and a plurality said Mr. Trump’s policies had helped economic conditions.

“Donald Trump has defied political gravity,” said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who also worked on the survey. “He’s created a very loyal base.”

Among those considered most likely to vote, a smaller pool than those identified as registered voters, Democrats held an 8-point advantage on the question of which party should control the next Congress. This is the first time in the midterm campaign that the Journal/NBC News poll has delineated which voters are most likely to cast ballots.

Despite most voters’ sunny view of the economy, 59% in the survey said they wanted a change from the direction Mr. Trump has been leading. That group included nearly one-third of Republicans.

A call for change has been a harbinger of past “wave” elections that have flipped control of Congress. Before the 1994 midterm elections that gave the GOP a majority, 62% of voters said they wanted a change in direction from President Bill Clinton’s leadership.

The poll found that Democrats are benefiting from a strong showing of support among women. By 3 percentage points, men want Republicans rather than Democrats to control Congress, 47% to 44%. Women, by contrast, favor Democratic control by 25 percentage points—58% to 33%.

Among white voters, the gender disparity was the largest since 2008.

The poll was taken Sept. 16-19, after an accusation of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh became public and turned the spotlight on the politics of gender.

Asked which issues would have the biggest impact on their voting decisions, voters put the economy at the top of the list, followed closely by health care and combating corruption and special-interest influence in Washington.

Despite presiding over the strong economy, Republicans didn’t have a clear advantage among voters who said the economy was the most important or a very important issue. Some 47% of that group said they preferred Republican control of Congress, while 45% favored Democratic control.

Voters who said health care was their top issue heavily favored a Democratic-led Congress, 58% to 34%. Republicans led among voters who cited trade or foreign policy as top issues.

The poll found support for helping Dreamers, the immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Some 58% of voters said a candidate would be more likely to win their vote by supporting a program to help Dreamers work or attend college legally in the U.S., while 22% said they would be less likely to support that candidate.

In a sign that many voters are looking for a check on Mr. Trump, 53% said they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who sticks with the president on policy issues more than 90% of the time.

The poll also pointed to why Democrats have been shying away from calling for impeachment hearings for Mr. Trump. Some 36% said they would be more likely to support a candidate who backed such hearings, but more voters—42%—said they would be less likely to support that candidate.

The Journal/NBC News survey included 900 registered voters. The margin of error for that sample was plus or minus 3.27 percentage points.

"The forensic medical services morgue in Acapulco is often full, even though it has five refrigerators which can hold approximately 400 bodies at a time.

The forensic medical services morgue in Acapulco is often full, even though it has five refrigerators which can hold approximately 400 bodies at a time.

ACAPULCO, Mexico—It was the beginning of just another day in one of the world’s most murderous places.

Cristian Sabino was sitting on a plastic chair by this beach resort’s central market when a gunman walked up and shot him five times. As the 22-year-old dropped to the ground, the assailant fired a final bullet to the head and walked away.

Six more people would be killed that day in Acapulco, including a cabdriver who was hacked to pieces. Death is so much part of the landscape that once police cordoned off the area around Mr. Sabino’s body, some patrons at a nearby rotisserie chicken restaurant stayed to finish their meals.

Acapulco’s days as a tourist resort with a touch of Hollywood glamour seem long ago. In a city of 800,000, 953 people were violently killed last year, more than in Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Portugal and the Netherlands put together.

There were more than 900 murders in Acapulco last year. Violence is so pervasive in this city, once a premier Mexican tourist destination, that criminology has become a thriving new profession. Photo/Video: Jake Nicol/The Wall Street Journal

It’s not just Mexico. There is a murder crisis across much of Latin America and the Caribbean, which today is the world’s most violent region. Every day, more than 400 people are murdered there, a yearly tally of about 145,000 dead.

With just 8% of the world’s population, Latin America accounts for roughly a third of global murders. It is also the only region where lethal violence has grown steadily since 2000, according to United Nations figures.

Nearly one in every four murders around the world takes place in just four countries: Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico and Colombia. Last year, a record 63,808 people were murdered in Brazil. Mexico also set a record at 31,174, with murders so far this year up another 20%.

The 2016 tally in China, according to the U.N.: 8,634. For the entire European Union: 5,351. The United States: 17,250.

Crime slows development and spurs migration to the U.S. Violence costs Latin America 3% of annual economic output, on average, twice the level of developed countries, according to a 2016 study by the Inter-American Development Bank. The price tag for crime, which the bank put at between $115 billion and $261 billion, is comparable to the total regional spending on infrastructure, or the income of the poorest third of Latin Americans.

In recent years, growing numbers of families from Central America, including women and children, have fled to the U.S. because of horrific violence. Gangs such as MS-13 and Barrio 18 enforce a reign of terror, dictating even where people can go to school or get medical care. El Salvador’s murder rate of 83 per 100,000 people in 2016—the world’s highest—was nearly 17 times that of the U.S.

A new study by Vanderbilt University shows that the strongest factor in predicting whether someone emigrates from Honduras and El Salvador isn’t age, gender or economic situation, but whether they had been victimized by crime multiple times in the past year. A World Bank study found that nearly a quarter of children in one Honduran municipality suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder due to violence.

At the Acapulco morgue, bodies pile up faster than workers can process them. The morning after Mr. Sabino’s murder, there were already three new victims lying on gurneys awaiting autopsy. A few feet away, 356 bodies that remain unclaimed or unidentified were stuffed into five refrigeration units. The smell of death hung in the air.

“We never catch up,” says Ben Yehuda Martínez, the top forensic official for the state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located. “While we’re trying to clear the first set of bodies, another set of bodies arrives.”

Just this week, Mr. Martínez’s counterpart in the state of Jalisco was fired after it emerged that two trailer trucks filled with more than 150 cadavers each were roaming Mexico’s second-largest city of Guadalajara for days because the local morgue was too full. Officials admitted the trucks contained corpses after neighbors complained of the smell and dripping blood.

Mr. Martínez, 60, has seen it all. His very first case as a young forensic specialist in the nearby city of Iguala was the 1997 autopsy of two doctors who had botched a plastic surgery operation, accidentally killing drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Their bodies, encased in cement, were found on the side of the Mexico City-to-Acapulco highway. Mr. Martínez’s verdict: They were both asphyxiated with a tourniquet.

Mr. Martínez says he hasn’t ever become used to seeing children killed. “Before, criminals never killed kids. But now I do autopsies on 7- or 8-year-olds,” he says. He teaches chemistry and biology at a local college. “I’ve had the shock of having to autopsy quite a few of my former students.”

Up to 10% of the cadavers that arrive are never claimed. No one files a police report or bothers to pick up the body. Other times, there is no way to identify a corpse: “We sometimes get only a leg or a head to work with,” he says.

Latin America accounts for 43 of the 50 most murderous cities, including the entire top 10, according to the Igarapé Institute, a Brazilian think tank that focuses on violence. South Africa and the U.S.—where St. Louis ranks No. 19—are the only countries outside Latin America that crack the top 50.

At current murder rates, if you live in Acapulco (or Caracas, Venezuela, or San Salvador) for 70 years, there is a roughly 1-in-10 chance you will get murdered.

Between 2000 and 2017, roughly 2.5 million people were murdered in Latin America and the Caribbean, as if Chicago were wiped out. That compares with about 900,000 killed in the armed conflicts of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan combined, according to U.N. figures and estimates by groups like Iraq Body Count.

During that same period, all the world’s terrorist attacks killed 243,000 people, according to the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database.

“Large swaths of Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico and Venezuela are experiencing a war in all but name,” says Robert Muggah, head of the Igarapé Institute.

The vast majority of victims and perpetrators are young men, killed mostly by gunshot. A vital Twitter feed in Rio de Janeiro is “Onde Tem Tiroteo,” or “Where’s the Shootout?” which tells motorists which parts of the city to avoid. Some recent entries: “A grenade was thrown on the pedestrian bridge near Zuzu Angel Tunnel.” “Shots on 2nd Street in Rocinha, police base under shooting attack.”

Shockingly, 1,379 babies under one year of age died violently in Brazil between 2000 and 2015, according to government statistics. Nearly 30,000 victims in Brazil were over 60 years old.

Gabriela Victoria's daughter Erica was kidnapped and murdered by long-time acquaintances from her Acapulco neighborhood.

Mexico’s murder tally may be underreported because many victims are tossed into unmarked graves, burned or put through sugar-cane grinders. In Tijuana, Santiago Meza confessed to dissolving more than 300 people in acid for a local cartel, earning the nickname “Pozolero,” or soup maker. The state of Coahuila, once under the control of the hyperviolent Zetas drug cartel, holds some 103,000 bone fragments belonging to unidentified bodies.

The sheer number of the missing could outnumber better-known cases of “disappeared” in Latin America’s sometimes bloody history, including Argentina’s Dirty War against leftists in the late 1970s.

Mexico has become a nation of unmarked graves where a small army of grieving mothers financed by bake sales search for their missing children. Their technology: They hire construction workers to hammer steel rods 6 feet into the ground, and then sniff the ends. If it smells of death, then it’s probably an unmarked grave. The government gives little support.

“It’s an interminable search,” says Guadalupe Contreras, one such searcher. “Today you find 20. Tomorrow, they bury another 20 somewhere else.” This month, the state of Veracruz discovered a mass grave with 168 skulls.

While murder rates are falling in most of the world, in Latin America the number of murders has grown about 3.7% a year since 2000, three times faster than the population, according to the Igarapé Institute. The region’s murder rate, at about 24 per 100,000 right now, will hit 35 per 100,000 by 2030 if the trend isn’t reversed.

Crime affects everyday life. About half of respondents in Latin America said they stopped going out at night, while more than 1-in-10 said they had moved due to the fear of violence, according to a survey from the U.N. Considering Latin America’s population, that’s more than 62 million people who felt the need to change homes.

Once the party spot of choice for the wealthy and famous, Acapulco has descended into disrepair and despair.

How did it get this bad?

Latin America was colonized violently and had bloody wars of independence. It has the world’s biggest gap between rich and poor, fueling resentment. Large parts of the economy are “informal,” street markets and family-run businesses that operate outside government control and pay no taxes, creating a culture of skirting the law. It has powerful groups of organized crime like Mexican drug cartels, and weak states riddled with corruption.

Demographics play a role: Latin America has more young people than most other regions, making for too many young men chasing too few quality jobs. And it has weak educational systems. Only 27% of Brazilians aged 25 or older have completed high school, according to government figures.

Much of Latin America also urbanized rapidly without services such as schooling and policing, creating belts of excluded groups around cities. Migration may have made matters worse. The percentage of single-parent homes in Mexico and Central America has grown rapidly over the past 20 years.

Latin America is also awash in guns, most of them held illegally. Nearly 78% of murders in Central America between 2000 and 2015 were caused by guns, compared with a global average of 32%, according to the Igarapé Institute. (In the U.S., it is around 73%.)

These factors create vicious cycles. Laura Chioda, a researcher at the World Bank, found that as many as 40% of young people in Honduras suffer from some form of depression due to the violence. “Now, imagine them at school,” she asks. “Can you teach calculus to someone with that level of trauma?” Many drop out and join the informal economy, where they won’t have a salary, training or career prospects. “Once there, they find this parallel structure of crime that provides jobs, services and an identity,” she says.

Marcelo Bergman, a sociologist who runs the Latin America Violence Research Center in Buenos Aires, thinks the informal economy plays a role. He says much of rising income at a time of economic growth among the region’s poor since 2000 went to consumption in the informal economy, creating more demand for stolen car parts, knockoff clothing and pirated movies. That gave more power to the mafias that supply them.

Latin America’s powerful mafias come from two accidents of geography: One is sitting next to the world’s biggest market for illegal drugs, the U.S., and the other is being the only region in the world to grow the coca plant, the main ingredient in cocaine, which remains among the world’s most profitable drugs. Organized crime accounts for about two-thirds of Mexico’s murders, experts say.

Mexico’s Independence Day celebrations on the night of Sept. 15 were marred when gunmen dressed as mariachi singers entered the city’s fabled Garibaldi plaza and gunned down five people, allegedly in a dispute over local drug sales.

Organized crime doesn’t explain all the violence, however. In Colombia, for instance, it accounts for anywhere from a quarter to half of crimes, government officials estimate. Latin America also has high rates of interpersonal and family violence. Colombian officials say the most murderous day of every year in Colombia is Mother’s Day, when revelers get drunk. Next on the list: New Year’s and Christmas.

Latin America wasn’t always the most murderous region in the world. In the 1950s, Singapore and Caracas had very similar murder rates, between 6 to 10 per 100,000 residents, according to Manuel Eisner, who studies historical levels of violence at the Violence Research Centre in Cambridge, U.K.

At the time, Singapore suffered from gangs, prostitution, drug trafficking and corruption. But after independence in 1962, authoritarian Lee Kwan Yew enforced rule of law, boosted education, and created a culture of working hard and achievement, and ensured social integration. “It wasn’t all coercion—there was a caring element,” says Mr. Eisner.

Nowadays, Singapore’s murder rate is 0.4 per 100,000 residents. In Caracas, the government doesn’t bother to count. The nongovernmental Venezuelan Violence Observatory estimates the country’s murder rate is roughly 110 per 100,000—about 34,000 a year.

Not all of Latin America has this problem. Chile’s murder rate of 3.6 per 100,000 sits well below the U.S. The state of Yucatán in Mexico has a similarly low murder rate. Even within cities, crime is concentrated: Half of all crime in Bogotá, Colombia, takes place in just 2% of the city. That makes good policing crucial to lowering violence.

But with some exceptions such as Chile, and increasingly Colombia, Latin America has largely failed to build strong legal institutions. Less than 20% of homicides in the region are solved. In Mexico, the figure is below 10%. Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office, the country’s version of the FBI, investigated more than 600 murder cases linked to organized crime in the past eight years. It won a guilty verdict in just two. That kind of impunity literally means that you can get away with murder.

When impunity is high, people take justice into their own hands. In mid-May, locals in the town of Miravalle in southern Mexico grabbed three men accused of holding up an elderly woman and burned them alive. No arrests were made in the case, state officials say.

A 10-year study of murder cases in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte found that police investigations lasted an average of 500 days, the average trial lasted 10 years and in a quarter of the cases the statute of limitations ran out—allowing the suspect to go free. Some 7% of suspects were slain before their sentence was handed out, in many cases by families of victims tired of waiting for justice.

Latin American prisons, the most overcrowded in the world, breed violence. Wardens have little control. The murder rate in Latin American prisons is 16 per 100,000—by far the world’s highest, according to U.N. figures. In two of the most chaotic prison systems—in Venezuela and Brazil—hundreds of prisoners die in gang fights each year and warlord inmates run vast drug-trafficking outfits that, on the outside, control swaths of territory.

The prison system is so weak that Colombia’s Pablo Escobar was allowed to build his own jail in the early 1990s, and Mexican kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman escaped twice from a maximum-security prison.

The spread of democracy in the 1990s across the region has had a perverse effect. Authoritarian states have an easier time controlling organized crime and violence. Many parts of Latin America got democracy before the rule of law; parts of Asia got the rule of law without democracy. Cuba, the hemisphere’s lone communist state, has a homicide rate estimated at about 4 per 100,000 residents.

Democracy in places such as Mexico disrupted existing arrangements between governments and organized crime that allowed for a pax mafiosa, says Eduardo Guerrero, a Mexican violence researcher. State governors would allow drug gangs to ferry narcotics to the U.S. in exchange for money and a promise to keep violence in check, not sell drugs near schools and reinvest some of the profits locally. The marketplace for votes upset those arrangements.

“None of these governors had bothered to build capable police forces because they relied on these arrangements,” he says. “But when the arrangements broke apart, they didn’t have any way to control the violence.”

In many ways, Acapulco is a perfect metaphor for Latin America’s broader failures. It is a place of stunning beauty spoiled by the same factors that fuel violence across the region: inequality, rapid and unplanned urbanization, lack of good institutions from education to police, deeply rooted corruption and an anything-goes attitude to the law.

Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra and John Wayne were regulars here during the resort’s heyday in the 1940s and 1950s. Two American presidents—John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton—made it their honeymoon destination. Later on, for more daring tourists, Acapulco was the place they could do what they couldn’t back home. Marijuana and cocaine were easily available at discos and from taxi drivers, and prostitution thrived, with brothels sitting just a block from the main strip.

“Acapulco was a place where tourists were allowed to do anything. So it’s not that surprising that locals also began to view the place as a city where there were no rules,” says Elisabet Sabartes, a Spanish journalist who is writing a book on the city’s violence. During the four years she has lived there, five acquaintances have been murdered.

As the drug war escalated, the tourist-dependent economy of Acapulco quickly declined and many large construction projects were left unfinished or abandoned.

Despite opium fields in the nearby mountains, violence here only took off in 2006, when the drug gang that controlled Guerrero split into two rival groups. It got worse in 2011, when Mexican marines killed kingpin Arturo Beltran Leyva, prompting further splits. Nowadays, more than two dozen rival gangs fight for control of the city’s criminal market.

Many no longer have the clout to carry out big drug deals, so they turn to other activities such as extortion. Practically every business in Acapulco pays. Father Jesus Mendoza, a priest, says some of his colleagues get extorted, and gangs have stolen church bells from some parishes to sell for the copper. The effect on business has been predictably bad. No new hotel has been built in more than a decade.

“The only thriving businesses around here are funeral homes,” says Laura Caballero, the head of a shopkeeper association. She closed her eight shops along the city’s main beachfront avenue three years ago due to monthly extortion demands that reached $800 per store. She says several fellow shopkeepers who refused to pay were killed.

The police have been incapable of stopping the violence. In 2014, most members of Acapulco’s police force were given a battery of tests to see if they were honest, including psychological profiles and lie-detector tests. Some 700 out of 1,100 failed.

When the Acapulco mayor at the time tried to fire the cops who failed, the entire police force walked off the job for 11 months. He backtracked. During the walkout, crime actually fell slightly. Scores of police who failed the test are still on the job, say security experts and former policemen.

In 2014, Mexico was outraged when local police in Iguala, another city in the same state, handed over 43 college kids to a drug gang, who are believed to have incinerated the teens. Most experts think the students accidentally commandeered a passenger bus that had heroin on it heading for the U.S., and police, in the pay of a local drug gang, thought the kids belonged to a rival cartel.

Acapulco’s police chief, Max Sedano, failed his recent lie-detector test, according to a local opposition-party congressman, Ricardo Mejia. Mr. Sedano, who remains in his post, told local journalists he didn’t know if he failed the test. The tests, usually done by federal officials, are confidential, and by law only the municipalities can fire their own officials. Mr. Sedano declined to be interviewed for this article.

“It’s not right that the police here aren’t in charge. The cartels are in charge,” says a 17-year veteran of Acapulco’s police force who quit in disgust last year.

There is a saying in Acapulco: If you want to be an old cop, look the other way.

In the hours after Mr. Sabino was murdered in Acapulco’s market recently, a local detective turned up, wearing a crocodile-skin belt and dark glasses. He asked no questions of witnesses. After the body was picked up by a forensic team, the detective left.

The violence in Acapulco has created a dystopia where social norms have broken down. Growing numbers of children drop out of school. Fewer go to church. Many hit men and teens worship La Santa Muerte, the cult of death represented by a grim reaper. A less toxic version is St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes. Mr. Sabino’s body had a tattoo of St. Jude, according to the autopsy report.

Perhaps the most notorious crime in Acapulco in recent years was the kidnap and murder of at least 10 teenagers by a gang of students who attended a local university. The gang targeted acquaintances, including classmates and friends from high school. One gang member had his own girlfriend abducted and killed. Members of the gang, after collecting ransom money and still killing their hostages, would even go to their victims’ funerals and mourn with the parents.

“What kinds of people do these things?” asked Elsa Ceballos, whose 19-year-old son was strangled by the kidnap gang.

At an Acapulco criminology college called Centro Forense, nearly every student in a ballistics class raises their hand when asked if they have been affected by violence. Conin Pascual’s father was killed. Luis Rodríguez’s cousin, a cabdriver, was hacked to pieces.

Carlos Kevin, 19, saw his first dead bodies at age 13, when he arrived at his middle school and there were two mangled bodies on the street.

“There are no cops in our neighborhoods and when there is a killing, they don’t want to investigate,” said Anitxa Gutierrez, who was 14 when a shootout left bullet holes in her family’s living room.

Santiago García, an eighth-grade teacher, says he tries to teach the students values in a society where social norms are breaking down. He also teaches them boxing so they can manage their anger.

Santiago García teaches his students boxing to give them an outlet for their frustrations.

“In the past, when kids got a failing grade, parents would ask how they could help. Now, I’ve had parents threaten to kill me or hire a hit man if I don’t pass their children,” he says.

Mr. García says between 30 and 40 kids didn’t return for this school year, in large part because their parents were threatened, a family member had already been killed, or the kids were being forced by gangs to sell drugs at the school. In many cases, the families simply left Acapulco.

Across the street from Mr. García’s middle school stands a pink house that was used by a gang to hold hostages. One day, during school hours, it was raided by marines, who pulled out several human remains. On another recent morning, a sixth-grader entered school crying, saying he had just found his uncle’s dead body outside the school gates.

“We ask the kids, where do you see yourselves in 20 years, and some say, ‘Carrying an AK-47!’ ” says Mr. García. Locals share videos of killings posted by local gangs. One recent video showed a teen being sliced open and his beating heart taken out.

Javier Morlett is an Acapulco native who knows the city better than anyone. His father was mayor in the 1960s and Mr. Morlett ran both the city’s airport and port at various stages in his career. In 2012, his 21-year-old daughter, who was studying at Mexico’s leading public university in Mexico City, was abducted. After an agonizing two-year search, he found her remains. The crime was never solved.

“I don’t think we can solve this,” he says of the violence. “This place was paradise, but we’ve turned it into an inferno.”

Historically an area where wealthy Americans would have their yachts repaired, Playa Manzanillo has now become known for the bodies that wash up on its shores, victims of Mexico's drug violence.

"President Trump and his European counterparts square off at the United Nations this week on key policy issues dividing old allies: the fate of the Iran nuclear agreement and how to constrain the Islamic Republic’s regional ambitions.

The week of marathon diplomacy in New York will be the first time that heads of states of the U.S., European nations and Iran gather at the General Assembly since Mr. Trump quit the 2015 Iran nuclear accord in May and will put U.S.-European divisions on global display.

Mr. Trump and top officials plan to use the U.N. forum—including a speech by Mr. Trump on Tuesday to world leaders, a Security Council session he is chairing and a series of meetings—to denounce Iran, and mobilize international support for isolating the country through crippling sanctions. A key component of their complaint will be Iran’s meddling in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen and its continued financial and military support of militant groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas.

But the Europeans plan to counter the U.S. position that the nuclear agreement has failed and that new sanctions must be imposed. European countries have tried to help Iran navigate the sanctions, including on banking transactions, by creating economic incentives so Iran stays committed to the deal, though their ability to maintain economic ties with Tehran is limited and the continent’s companies are rapidly pulling out.

Iran, for its part, will attempt to widen the gap between the U.S. and Europe by portraying itself as abiding by its commitments while the U.S. disregards international accords.

British, French and German diplomats plan to meet Monday with counterparts from Iran and other parties to the accord—Russia and China—to try to persuade Tehran to stick with the agreement as U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports take hold in November and foreign companies continue to depart.

Most Western businesses appear to be heeding Washington’s warnings it will punish those found violating its economywide sanctions campaign. The risk of losing access to the world’s largest economy and most important financial markets isn’t worth keeping ties to a country whose gross domestic product is dwarfed by the U.S. Companies such as Boeing Co. and German industrial firm Wintershall have either pulled out completely or said they are planning an exit.

Ahead of Nov. 4, when some of the strongest sanctions kick in, Iran crude imports have fallen over the last four months in many of Tehran’s biggest customers, analysts say.

The remaining parties to the 2015 accord are expected to issue a statement in support of the deal after the meeting.

The sharply differing views will put Washington and Europe on opposing courses on the world stage.

“Talking about Iran, talking about their proxies and the other things they are doing to destabilize the Middle East will certainly be a topic,” U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Thursday in a preview of the administration’s priorities.

France and Britain acknowledge concerns over Iran’s assertive role in the region and its ballistic missile program, but diplomats said each plans to deliver a “strong speech” in defense of the deal during the meeting chaired by Mr. Trump.

Europeans will portray the agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, “as one of the backbones of avoiding Iran getting nuclear weapon,” said one Security Council diplomat. France’s President Emmanuel Macron plans to resurrect his proposal for “JCPOA Plus,” a plan that called for the U.S. to remain committed to the accord as world powers work out a parallel understanding on how to limit Iran’s missile program and press Tehran on its regional policies.

Iran and Europe point out that the deal was limited to the nuclear program and that U.N. monitors repeatedly have certified that Iran has been abiding by the terms of the pact.

The provisions of the nuclear deal the Europeans support are not nearly as stringent as what the Trump administration is now demanding: an end to all uranium enrichment by Iran.

And while the U.S. and the Europeans are close on how to deal with Iran’s missiles, the U.S. demands that sanctions be imposed unless Iran withdraws its forces from Syria, ends all support for militant groups and ends threats to Israel are tougher than the positions taken in European capitals on Tehran’s posture in the Middle East.

The meetings are likely to be colored by Saturday’s terrorist attack on a military parade in Iran’s southern city of Ahvaz, in which at least 25 people were killed and 60 injured.

Both Islamic State and a separatist Iranian Arab group claimed responsibility. Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and other top Iranian officials blamed regional foes and the U.S. for backing anti-Iranian groups.

On Sunday, before leaving for the U.N. meeting, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the U.S. doesn’t “want security in Iran, they want to foment chaos and they want to create the conditions needed for them to return to the country one day and become masters of the people similar to the past.”

The State Department issued a statement condemning “all acts of terrorism and the loss of any innocent lives” and said it stands with the Iranian people.

Brian Hook, the State Department special envoy on Iran, said earlier this month that the U.S. wants to negotiate a new and broader treaty with Iran that would cover its regional activities, missile tests and nuclear program. Iran rejected the offer as out of the question.

Mr. Trump has said that he is prepared to meet with Iran’s leaders on his demands. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Sunday that Mr. Trump was even willing to meet with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and any Iranian official in New York this week.

Mr. Khamenei has banned Iranian officials from direct negotiating or meetings with American counterparts, saying that the U.S. exit from the nuclear deal shows Iran can’t trust America.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Rouhani are scheduled to give dueling addresses to the General Assembly. An Iranian official said Mr. Rouhani has drafted several speeches and will choose the most appropriate response to Mr. Trump, who is due to speak first.

“The goal is to use this time to make Trump look bad and place Iran on Europe’s side. We have a lot of meetings planned with the Europeans,” an Iranian official in Tehran said. He said Iran was arriving with a large delegation that included officials and experts in economy, trade, oil, policy and media.

Also on Tuesday, Mr. Pompeo, White House national security adviser John Bolton and Mr. Hook will speak at a conference held by United Against a Nuclear Iran, a group that opposed the nuclear accord. The foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Iran’s regional rivals, are among the others scheduled to speak at the event.

Mr. Trump on Wednesday chairs the Security Council session on nonproliferation, which will address Iran as well as disarming North Korea and Syria of chemical weapons.

Initially, Ms. Haley said the session would focus on Iran. The White House later expanded the topic to a broader discussion. Under the provisional rules of the Security Council, Iranian officials would be invited to speak if the Council discussed a specific agenda, such as Iran.

Both Iran and the U.S. have avoided having direct contact during previous General Assembly gatherings.

"HONG KONG—A high-speed rail station that opened Sunday promises more-rapid journeys between the financial hub and mainland China, but brings Beijing’s legal reach into Hong Kong for the first time, fanning concerns about the absorption of the semiautonomous territory into the mainland.

The almost $11 billion project—delayed for several years amid costly overruns—brings closer to fruition China’s plan to merge 11 cities in its Southern belt into one big economic cluster called the “Greater Bay Area.” Later this year, a bridge—the world’s longest cross-sea structure—will open, connecting Hong Kong to the Chinese city of Zhuhai and neighboring Macau, the world’s largest gambling hub.

Together, government officials here say the two new infrastructure links will make trading, logistics and commuting easier. The railway will also connect Hong Kong by bullet train to China’s domestic high-speed network, the world’s biggest and celebrated for stoking the nation’s rapid economic growth.

The trains, with names such as Harmony and Vibrant Express, run most frequently between cities in Southern China. About a hundred trains are scheduled to depart daily. It will be the fastest way to reach China’s tech hub of Shenzhen from Hong Kong, which houses the Asia headquarters of banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley . All around the new station, Bank of China advertisements touted cross-border financial services.

The trains connect to 44 destinations in China, including the capital city of Beijing. The 9-hour trip to China’s capital, at HK$1,237 ($158.40) in the lowest class, is about the same cost as a low-cost flight. Like the arrangement on the Eurostar train which shuttles passengers between London and Paris, travelers will now have their documents checked and processed by both Hong Kong and Chinese immigration officers before boarding the train, removing the need to go through border control upon arrival to the Chinese destination.

But the hundreds of mainland law enforcers who will be stationed inside the rail hub in the city’s West Kowloon district have stoked a political storm in the city, with China’s influence in Hong Kong rising since failed mass protests in 2014 to demand more democracy.

In December 2017, China’s top legislative body endorsed the plan to locate both Hong Kong and mainland officials in the station.

The unprecedented legal arrangement effectively means a strip of land in the heart of the former British colony will be governed under China’s national laws. One of the city’s top lawyers’ groups, the Hong Kong Bar Association, opposed the move as undermining semiautonomy Beijing guaranteed the city for 50 years when it resumed sovereignty in 1997.

In an opening ceremony Saturday, Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam thanked the body—the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress—for providing “a firm legal basis” for the arrangement, while touting the economic benefits the new transport network would provide to the city.

Many in the city have been chilled by Beijing’s growing power since two high-profile incidents—the disappearance of a bookseller and a Chinese billionaire from Hong Kong who later turned up in police custody on the mainland—raised concerns that Chinese law enforcers were taking increasingly intrusive actions to exercise their version of the law in Hong Kong.

“It’s like a Trojan horse infiltrating the city through the belly of the railway system,” said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker who also represents the district where the station stands. “It’s part of China’s endgame: From now they don’t need to kidnap anyone, they just need to lure people to the train station.”

Still, crowds of residents have welcomed the train and the convenience it brings. On Sunday hundreds lined up at different counter windows to check-in and buy tickets. Some took selfies inside the sunlit station with panoramic views of Hong Kong’s skyline.

Ho Kah Nai, a doctor, was lining up at the station on Sunday for a ticket to Shenzhen the following week. He said the train links would make it easier for medics offering services across the border to commute.

“I normally travel to the mainland once or twice a year,” he said. “But I expect to go much more frequently because of the railway.”

"OTRADNAYA, Russia—Vladimir Mishurov transformed the remnants of the “Lenin’s Path” collective farm in this village into a profitable business. He also helped make Russia the world’s largest wheat exporter for the first time since the last years of the czars.

Over the past decade or so, Mr. Mishurov replaced his aging Russian equipment with a dozen high-tech machines from John Deere and other makers, and started using powerful new fertilizers and seeds. He bought and rented more acres from neighbors and family, eventually reaching about 3,600, taking advantage of Russia’s overall low prices for land.

And as many farmers do in the U.S., he often worked days on end with little sleep, especially during the harvest.

The major difference between Mr. Mishurov and a farmer on America’s Great Plains: The Russian’s costs are lower, and mostly in rubles, making his overseas sales—priced in dollars—immensely more valuable.

Amid a multiyear, brutal slump in grain prices, Russian agriculture is thriving. The country exported more than 40 million tons of wheat in the year ending June, around 50% more than the previous year, and the highest level for any country in the past quarter-century. Russia overtook the U.S. as the world’s biggest exporter of wheat in 2016, and again beat the U.S. in 2018.

The growing Russian competition is one more pressure point threatening American farming, which is facing the biggest wave of farm closures in the U.S. since the 1980s. A global oversupply of grain has pushed prices down to around half the level in 2012, when prices peaked, making it difficult to turn a profit in dollars.

U.S. trade disputes with China and other countries could make Russian wheat even more attractive, if big buyers apply retaliatory tariffs to U.S. grains. China has added a 25% tariff on U.S. wheat, but Chinese restrictions on imports from Russia have prevented Moscow from taking advantage yet, according to Swithun Still, director at Switzerland-based Solaris Commodities SA, which trades Russian grain.

For now, “it’s not the trade war, it’s economics” that is helping Russian wheat compete, even in places close to the U.S. such as Mexico, Mr. Still said. Russian “quality got better, and it’s cheaper.”

Russian farmers come out ahead when export earnings are converted into rubles. Since the Russian currency has depreciated, a dollar now converts to twice as many rubles as it did in 2014. Russia has a similar advantage against the euro and other currencies. Russian farmers can cover their costs at home to keep planting, and also undercut Western competitors on price.

Russia’s surge of agriculture exports, including grains, fish and meat, is part of an effort to diversify the economy away from crude oil. Oil and natural gas were once the source of half of federal budget revenues. With oil prices still down 25% from their high in 2014—recovering from a swoon of more than 60%—exports now account for around 40% of budget revenues.

“Given the fall in prices for oil, grain has come to the fore. Grain is our oil,” then-Agriculture Minister Aleksandr Tkachev said in 2016.

Less-expensive Russian wheat is pushing U.S. and European grain out of import-dependent countries in the Mideast and North Africa, where the Kremlin has made a military and diplomatic push for influence in recent years.

Agriculture exports, at $20.7 billion in 2017, have overtaken the arms industry as Russia’s No. 2 earner. Wheat makes up about a quarter of the total.

Russia harvested an area of wheat almost twice as large as the U.S. in the year ended in June, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. American farmers, seeing little opportunity to profit, planted the smallest area of wheat since records began a century ago. U.S. wheat production shrank 25% in the year.

Mr. Mishurov’s farm is on the fertile steppe of southern Russia. The area is the country’s biggest grain producer—a bread basket known for its mineral-rich black earth and mild climate.

Now 46 years old, he spent his late teens and early 20s driving a bone-rattling tractor that needed its motor refurbished every year and left his hands callused. A lack of cash meant workers were paid in sacks of flour, wheat or sugar, and drunkenness was pervasive.

At the start of the 20th century, Russia had been the world’s largest exporter of wheat. The Soviets killed and imprisoned millions, including many of the most-successful farmers, as part of an effort to install a system of collective farming that proved inefficient. By the 1970s, the Soviet Union had to import grain.

Collective farms stumbled on after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, often still managed by the same bosses without business smarts or cash to invest.

“No one was in charge,” said Mr. Mishurov. “They couldn’t adapt to the market economy. They were accustomed to unthinkingly following instructions.”

Farmhands worked “to pass the time of day until they could go home,” said Andrei Burdin, a farmer from a nearby village who works land that was once part of the “Dawn of Communism” collective farm. “Farming was at a dead end.”

Russia opened the land market at the end of the 1990s, but new investors and their managers tended to be far from the land and averse to risks, farmers said.

Mr. Mishurov, who worked as chief agronomist at a large farming conglomerate, recalled telling an executive in the early 2000s that using pesticide could increase the barley crop by around a quarter.

Mr. Burdin worked with a farmhand. Photo: DMITRI BELIAKOV for The Wall Street Journal

“ ‘No, Vova, it’s enough already,’ ” he said the executive replied, using a nickname. “Why should I persuade someone to earn more money?” Mr. Mishurov said.

He struck out on his own in the mid-2000s. At first, he pooled land with relatives and used whatever equipment he could lay his hands on. Today, he grows wheat, barley, beets, corn, sunflowers, peas and other crops.

Mr. Burdin, 43, started farming around 250 acres in 2005 with a dilapidated tractor and planter. He invested early profits into more-efficient vehicles and better fertilizer, and expanded territory by renting from neighbors.

“When we made the first money, I didn’t buy a Mercedes or an apartment,” he said. “I put it into the next season.”

At first, he bought Russian equipment, but later upgraded to John Deere tractors and combines, which the Russians call zelyonaya tekhnika, or “green machines.” Mr. Burdin said he tested a John Deere combine against a Russian one and found it produced about one-third more grain from the same area.

He also added a planter from Sweden’s Vaderstad AB that shoots seeds into the ground at the optimal depth and intervals, improving yields. He now farms about 3,700 acres.

In April, while loading the planter with seed, Mr. Burdin joked with farmhands about equipment in the old days. He recalled working with a pesticide sprayer that would soak him with chemicals. He said he could only work for about four hours at a time before giving up, out of fear for his health. Now, his sprayer can measure how much pesticide to spray and where, keeping costs down.

The price of land in the region where Messrs. Mishurov and Burdin live is significantly lower than for many foreign rivals. On average, farmland in Romania, a European Union member on the Black Sea, is nearly three times the price, while farmland in Iowa and Kansas is more than five times the price, according to a 2017 survey by Moscow-based SovEcon, which provides consulting services, analysis and forecasts on Russian agriculture.

Mr. Burdin said Russian seeds and fertilizers still cost less than Western brands, even though they have improved significantly in recent years. He buys wheat seeds from a state-run agricultural institute, and can plant the seeds produced from those plants the next season. Many American farmers use expensive, high-yield, patented seeds from companies such as Bayer AG or DowDuPont Inc., which don’t allow the produced seeds to be planted, requiring farmers to buy fresh seeds annually.

Transport costs are also low for the region. It is close to Black Sea ports, and gasoline costs are much lower than in Western Europe. Mr. Burdin and Mr. Mishurov run their own fleets of trucks that move grain to the Novorossiysk port some 200 miles away by road.

Private and state-owned companies have modernized grain terminals in recent years and increased their capacities. Farmers can use an app on a smartphone to book a slot for their trucks to deliver grain, rather than the old system of having trucks wait in line for days.

Bumper harvests are stretching infrastructure. Windows for unloading grain are snapped up quickly, and farmers are often assigned slots several days after a requested time, Mr. Burdin said.

Exports “could be even higher if they could figure out how to load more,” he said.

Russia has made it a priority. President Vladimir Putin ordered officials to tackle infrastructure bottlenecks that are holding back exports. In inland areas, large distances and a lack of train cars and storage silos hamper grain from reaching external markets.

One of Russia’s largest terminals in Novorossiysk is completing a three-year modernization this year that will nearly double its capacity. Other companies have announced plans to build or expand terminals on the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea in the north and in the Far East. Officials said expansions at ports could increase export capacity of grains by 50% to 7.5 million tons a month by 2020.

Government officials tout the importance of state subsidies, including inexpensive loans to help farmers replace old equipment. Analysts and farmers say the state’s efforts to support agriculture have been hit and miss. Subsidies often make their way to well-connected companies, investment in infrastructure has been slow and bureaucrats and other officials often expect bribes.

“Farmers received the freedom to do business in the way they thought most efficient,” said Andrei Sizov Jr., managing director of SovEcon. “The role of the state was quite muted in the last 10 years, and that was good for the industry.”

Giant agroholdings, conglomerates often created by wealthy tycoons or people close to top federal and regional government officials, have built up spreads that dwarf Western farms. Individual farms larger than 250,000 acres, or nearly 400 square miles, account for around 13% of all land farmed in Russia, according to Mr. Sizov.

Mr. Mishurov can now afford to collect and restore a half-dozen vintage Soviet cars and vacation in the Maldives and Thailand, although he said he prefers staying home.

The poor villages here depend on the generosity of wealthier farmers. Mr. Mishurov funded renovations to his village’s statue of Lenin and a monument to locals who died in World War II, while Mr. Burdin paid to fix up his village’s kindergarten.

Mr. Mishurov employs 10 farmhands, three guards and a cook who prepares meals for the workers. “It’s a lot for our acreage, but we try to preserve jobs in the village,” he said. One recent morning, a man dropped by Mr. Mishurov’s farmyard office to cadge a bucket of corn for his hens. It was a former collective farm boss.

"BERLIN—Angela Merkel finally began her fourth and likely last term as chancellor on Wednesday, a step that presents her with some of the toughest domestic and international challenges in her years in power.

Germany’s parliament formally elected Ms. Merkel after the longest and most-complicated coalition-building exercise in post-War history. As she heads a fractious government of political opposites whose popular support is waning, Ms. Merkel will have to fend off economic threats from the U.S., address neighbors’ demands for European Union reform, and try to preserve political and social cohesion in a country tested by an unprecedented inflow of migrants.

Ms. Merkel’s renewed grand coalition between her conservatives and the Social Democrats is beginning under the threat of a trade war. With President Donald Trump at its helm, the U.S. has turned from Germany’s closest post-War partner into a rival.

Mr. Trump has piled criticism on Berlin for the country’s vast trade surplus and its meager defense spending, demanding it decrease the former and turbocharge the latter, neither of which Ms. Merkel’s coalition has any intention of doing.

Mr. Trump’s recent threats that Washington could impose a 25% levy on European car imports hits at Germany’s flagship industry and at the heart of its export-oriented economic model.

Ms. Merkel so far has shown little appetite for confrontation. While the European Commission, officially in charge of trade matters for the entire EU, has echoed Mr. Trump’s belligerent language, the chancellor has been more restrained.

The chancellor on Wednesday said talks to resolve the trade dispute were necessary, though she added there was “no need to be afraid if it becomes necessary to take measures ourselves, which we don’t want.

“That’s the best response, namely a common reaction from European Union member states,” she told German TV.

The chancellor has spoken of the need to spend more on defense. But while the latest budget foresees a gradual increase in spending, it will not be enough for Germany to hit the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s goal of 2% of GDP, which Mr. Trump insists on, any time soon.

Polls show the vast majority of Germans oppose higher defense spending and her left-leaning coalition partner, the SPD, is certain to block any big rise.

After almost a year of absence from the international stage during the electoral campaign and protracted coalition talks, Berlin must now take a position on demands by French President Emmanuel Macron for radical reform of the EU.

Mr. Macron outlined an ambitious set of proposals that would require higher German spending and sharing of financial risks—neither of which are popular in Europe’s largest economy. His agenda includes a common budget and joint finance minister for the eurozone as well as a push to complete a plan that would share the cost of protecting savers’ deposits in case of a banking crisis.

While the Social Democrats have made positive noise on the French proposals, Ms. Merkel remains non-committal. The coalition agreement is notably vague on the issue, leaving the chancellor some margin of maneuver. But aides have been pouring cold water on Paris’ hopes of major concessions.

In a sign that she accepts the urgency of starting the conversation, however, Ms. Merkel will travel to Paris on Friday with her new finance Minister Olaf Scholz of the SPD to meet their French counterparts.

France’s finance minister Bruno Le Maire acknowledged it wouldn’t be easy to agree on reforms even if they are necessary to recharge public support for the EU.

“There is now a small window of opportunity,” Mr. Le Maire said. “We need to strengthen the euro area in good times so we can face bad times.”

More than in her previous terms, Ms. Merkel will have to contend with domestic headwinds.

The 2015-2016 migration crisis, in which more than a million asylum seekers streamed into the country, played a major role in her disappointing election results. It also helped propel the five-year-old Alternative for Germany, a strident anti-immigration movement, into parliament as the largest opposition party.

The SPD’s pro-immigration views will be tough to reconcile with those of many in Ms. Merkel’s party as the government starts work on the first comprehensive immigration legislation in two years.

The Interior Minister from Ms. Merkel’s conservative bloc, Horst Seehofer, set the tone this weekend when he announced a “master plan” for deporting rejected asylum seekers. Over 200,000 immigrants are marked for deportation in Germany.

Ms. Merkel will also have to ensure the succession battle that has begun within her CDU doesn’t damage the party. The CDU is torn between a conservative and immigration-skeptical right wing and the guardians of Ms. Merkel’s centrist heritage.

The SPD, which is polling at a historic low of 18%, has made it clear it would be no cozy partner.

“We must be a clear opponent… from the outset, both in government and outside of it,” Ralf Stegner, the party’s vice-chairman, said this week.

"IRVINE, Calif.—In her district’s biggest city and across its conservative bastions, Republican U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters is facing criticism over the GOP tax overhaul bill that she voted for last month. The bill might increase taxes for many of her constituents, rather than lower them.

Under pressure from frustrated supporters, she is now working to modify the bill to ease the blow as lawmakers try to hash out a compromise with a measure passed by the Senate.

Three of California’s 14 House Republicans voted against the bill last month, citing measures that would curb or even eliminate some key deductions used widely by Californians. Mrs. Walters’s support for the bill, by contrast, has drawn scrutiny from some at a tense moment for the state’s Republicans, ahead of competitive midterm elections next year.

“I’m not going to vote for a Democrat, but am I going to vote for a Republican that is going to raise my taxes? That is the question,” said Jeffrey Lalloway, a divorce lawyer and Republican member of Irvine’s City Council.

Stephen Miller, a registered Republican until 2016—he switched to independent ahead of the presidential election—said he was furious with Mrs. Walters’s endorsement of the bill. A former corporate tax attorney in Irvine, Mr. Miller created a spreadsheet calculator for Orange County residents to estimate how much in taxes they would owe if the bill passes.

“When I step back at 30,000 feet, I see a bill that is taxing the rising middle class—people going to college, getting ahead by their own labor—at higher rates in order to lower taxes on income from existing wealth,” said Mr. Miller, 45 years old. “I’m trying to spread information about this tax bill. I think that is most effective in switching independents, swing voters.”

Analysts have said the GOP tax bill would give most people a modest tax break, at least in the first few years. But those benefits would be curbed in districts like Mrs. Walters’s, where some affluent residents could be pinched by new limits on deductions for state and local taxes, known as SALT, and mortgage interest that are still being negotiated.

In an interview Tuesday, Mrs. Walters acknowledged the tax bill’s limits to the SALT deduction sparked some worries and said she was pushing for changes to give constituents more flexibility. Currently, both the House and Senate bill only preserve the property-tax deduction up to $10,000.

Though she isn’t part of the formal group of negotiations, “I’ve been making my feelings known what I think is important in a final bill,” she said.

Mrs. Walters also said she is focused on trying to boost the mortgage-interest deduction, which the House voted to limit to loans totaling up to $500,000, down from $1 million in current law, which is also the level preserved by the Senate.

In 2015, the median property value in Orange County, where Mrs. Walters’s 45th district sits, was $625,300, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In the last quarter, the average price paid for a home in most neighborhoods in Mrs. Walters’s inland district hovered around or above the county median, according to data from CoreLogic , a data analytics firm.

“I’d like to see us come to a compromise on that,” potentially at around $750,000, said Mrs. Walters, who was first elected to Congress in 2014.

Without a change, people in Orange County worry that the measure would spur higher mortgage-interest rates, suppress home buying or bring other knock-on economic effects.

“You basically are creating a disincentive for people to buy those more expensive houses. It will have an impact on our real-estate prices here,” said Max Chao, continuing lecturer in accounting, tax, and law at the University of California, Irvine.

In addition to raising taxes on some upper middle-income professionals such as teachers, dentists, and engineers, the bill may also increase taxes on the highest-income brackets—including people like lawyers or bankers who, in some cases, are paying off student loans or starting and supporting families.

High-paid lawyers in Orange County are calling the bill the “millionaires-subsidizing-billionaires tax plan,” in a nod to some of their own clients, who would benefit from lower taxes on businesses and estates.

Orange County is known as a Republican center in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, but Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won Mrs. Walters’s district last year with 49% of the vote, even as the incumbent congresswoman was re-elected with nearly 59%. Mrs. Walters already has several Democratic challenges for what should be a competitive race next year.

Of the 23 GOP-controlled House districts won by Mrs. Clinton in 2016, Mrs. Walters’s has the fourth-highest percentage of tax filers taking the state and local deduction, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis of IRS data.

“People are obviously concerned about the state and local tax income deduction,” she said. “That makes it difficult for somebody like myself.”

On Tax Plan, Many Questions In several neighborhoods in California’s 45th District, from upscale Mission Viejo to more blue-collar Lake Forest, many people said they weren’t sure how the revised tax laws would affect their families. Realtors and tax accountants said they were surprised they weren’t being flooded with questions from clients. Jackie Stashik, a Realtor in Lake Forest, said the current mortgage deduction is what has allowed many of her clients to make the purchases they did. “When we first bought our home, it was the difference in us being able to afford our house. For many of my first time home buyers, it is the difference,” Ms. Stashik said. One of her clients, Amanda Penny, is looking for a new home for a better commute to her work at a mortgage company. Ms. Penny, 32 years old with a nearly-year old baby, said she hopes this next home would be the one she and her husband retire in. A voting Republican, she said she and her husband are watching what a tax overhaul might mean for them, but “it hasn’t impacted our decisions because, ultimately, we have to make the move.” If their taxes rise overall, she said they would look to make adjustments, including other deductions, to lessen the impact. Still, she said, the proposed lower mortgage-deduction cap “was kind of a slap in the face for us.” Michael McClellan, a Republican activist in Orange County who opposes the bill, said people may not be scrutinizing the tax plan or following the ins and outs of negotiations because, “I think by and large people trust the Republican Party on taxes.” “Which is why if this goes the wrong way, and people actually get a tax increase, the sense of betrayal will be so profound,” Mr. McClellan said. Mr. McClellan’s congressman, Dana Rohrabacher, voted against the bill. His district neighbors Mrs. Walters’s.

"Turkish authorities are sending signals that an American pastor facing terrorism charges could be released next month, raising fresh hopes in the U.S. that the polarizing dispute will soon be resolved.

A Turkish judge could free Pastor Andrew Brunson when he appears in court on Oct. 12—but only if the U.S. stops putting pressure on the country to send the American back to the U.S., according to Turkish officials.

“It’s a possible outcome,” one official said.

U.S. officials said that the Trump administration, which demanded the pastor be released immediately this summer, decided to ease off its pressure campaign amid fear that Turkey’s economic difficulties could spread to other emerging markets.

“The best strategy is, right before this October hearing, to be a little bit calm because they are recognizing finally now that we’re willing to act,” said one U.S. official familiar with the debate. “Come October, if we’re in the same place, our side is going to unload on the Turks. . . Right now it’s a critical time where you don’t want to put them in a bind.”

Release of the pastor wouldn’t just remove a major impediment to relations between the two North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, it would be a boon for President Trump and the Republican party as they try to hold off a Democratic surge and retain control of Congress.

Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have both made securing Mr. Brunson’s freedom a priority, and his case has become a cause for evangelical Christians whose votes could be pivotal to Republicans retaining their legislative majority.

Mr. Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will both be in New York this week to attend the United Nations General Assembly, but no meeting has been scheduled, according to U.S. and Turkish officials.

Speaking to reporters in New York on a break from the U.N. General Assembly, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed that Mr. Brunson could be released this month, but asserted that he and the other Americans being detained by Turkey and should never have been detained.

“I’m sure there will be some conversations in furtherance of that this week,” Mr. Pompeo said. “But make no mistake, there is nothing we will share with them here that we haven’t shared with them already about President Trump’s demands, that these innocent people who have truly done nothing wrong, cannot be detained wrongly.”

U.S. officials warned against any premature celebration, saying the issue was in the hands of the two leaders and that previous efforts to release him had collapsed at the last minute.

“Erdogan, just like Trump, is known to change his mind frequently and at the last minute,” the U.S. official said.

Mr. Brunson, a 50-year-old evangelical North Carolina pastor who was detained in Turkey in the wake of the 2016 failed coup, has been accused by Turkey of aiding terrorist groups. He has denied the charges and the U.S. government has characterized them as baseless.

U.S. officials said they saw positive signs in recent actions by Turkey, including a decision last week by a judge to reduce charges against Serkan Golge, a Turkish-American NASA scientist serving prison time on terrorism charges that the U.S. also characterizes as unfounded.

Mr. Golge’s sentence was cut from seven-and-a-half years to five years after the court overturned a conviction for being a member of a terrorist group and concluded that he aided the banned organization.

Selman Ogut, a Turkish attorney with close ties to Mr. Erdogan’s administration, said the judge could follow a similar route next month in Mr. Brunson’s case.

“He could be released in the upcoming month because charges aren’t of being member (of a terrorist organization),” said Mr. Ogut, who teaches law at Istanbul’s Medipol university. “We are talking about assistance.”

Timeline of Andrew Brunson’s Detention Oct. 7, 2016 American pastor Andrew Brunson is detained over irregularities in his immigration application. Dec. 9, 2016 Mr. Brunson is charged with aiding terrorism groups. He denies the accusations. June 24, 2018 Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wins re-election. July 18, 2018 Mr. Brunson is remanded to custody after a court hearing, dashing U.S. hopes for his release. President Trump tweets that the decision is “a total disgrace.” July 25, 2018 A Turkish court moves Mr. Brunson from jail to house arrest. Aug. 1, 2018 The U.S. imposes sanctions on Turkey over the pastor’s detention. Aug. 10, 2018 Mr. Trump announces a doubling in tariffs on some Turkish imports. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses the U.S. of waging an “economic war” against a NATO ally. Oct. 12, 2018 Mr. Brunson is due to appear in court for a trial hearing.

But Mr. Ogut said there was an important pre-condition to the pastor’s release.

“They must lean back and relax, otherwise it is a vicious circle,” he said. “If I were the judge, I could not accept to receive orders—do that, do that. America isn’t my boss.”

U.S. officials were so convinced they had a deal to secure the pastor’s freedom in July when he last appeared in court that they kept a plane on standby at an airbase in Germany to fly him out of Turkey at short notice. But Mr. Brunson was sent back to jail.

Turkey quickly moved Mr. Brunson to house arrest after Mr. Trump tweeted a denunciation of the court action as a “total disgrace.” Further negotiations failed to secure Mr. Brunson’s freedom.

Last month, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on two top Turkish officials over Mr. Brunson’s case, a move that exacerbated an economic crisis in Turkey that pushed the lira to historic lows.

Mr. Erdogan denounced the action as an “economic war,” but he privately sought ways to resolve the standoff, according to the Turkish officials.

Mr. Brunson, who ran a small Presbyterian church in the Turkish coastal city of Izmir at the time of his arrest in October 2016, was transferred to his home on July 25 after a court ruled to ease the conditions of his detention, citing health concerns.

He now lives secluded in Izmir, monitored by an electronic bracelet attached to his ankle, according to his lawyer, Ismail Cem Halavurt.

“His mood is much better because while in jail, he had some memory lapses and was on anti-depressants,” the lawyer said.

In preparation for the Oct. 12 hearing, the lawyer said he has received memos containing new accusations levelled by secret witnesses codenamed Sword and Dagger. One of them alleges that Mr. Brunson transported bags of cash by boat into Syria. Like previous secret witnesses, the person is expected to appear through video link, with the face blurred and voice altered.

“I have yet to tell” Mr. Brunson, the lawyer said. “He is bewildered by such nonsense.”

Even if Mr. Brunson were released the two governments would still face a host of issues, from divergence over how to restore peace in Syria to Turkey’s proposed purchase of an advanced missile defense system from Russia.

U.S. and Turkish officials said they were nervous that a single tweet could ruin hopes to resolve the Brunson case.

On Thursday, Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak—the son-in-law of Mr. Erdogan—who had seen his first economic speech in August tarnished by a flurry of Mr. Trump’s angry tweets—made another presentation.

As he took the floor, he asked the audience: “Everything OK on Twitter ?”

"Within hours of a fire at Kelly Laub’s four-bedroom house in New Smyrna Beach, Fla., in June, four contracting companies showed up to offer rebuilding services.

Each vendor wanted Ms. Laub to sign a document giving the contractor the rights to her homeowners insurance benefits, she said. In exchange, they offered to repair her home and negotiate with her insurance company on her behalf.

These assignment of benefit, or AOB, contracts are upending the insurance market in one of the largest U.S. states. Insurers and regulators said the pacts are responsible for driving up insurance rates for some Florida homeowners and spurring a boom in contractor lawsuits against insurers.

Based on current AOB trends, the average statewide annual homeowners insurance premium for a $150,000 new home is projected to rise from $1,232.08 in 2017 to $1,595.07 in 2022, a 29% increase, according to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. These increases are higher than nationwide projections from the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group.

Rate increases could steepen, executives said, if damage from Hurricane Irma last month causes major losses for the state’s insurers or an increase in AOB-related lawsuits. Many Irma-related insurance claims are still being processed so it’s too soon to see much litigation related to the storm. Catastrophe-modeling firms expect the insured losses to reach the tens of billions.

“The concern is that when you have a large event such as Irma, that when you add AOB on top of it, it’s just going to magnify the impact of the storm,” said Don Matz, president of Tower Hill Insurance in Gainesville, Fla. Tower Hill has raised rates for homeowners in some Southeast Florida counties by up to 15% in the past year partly due to AOB costs, he said.

AOBs allow repair companies to report a homeowner’s claim to an insurer and be paid directly, without the money going first to the consumer. Contractors can sue the insurer if there is a disagreement about the cost of the claim. They also can go after homeowners to make up for shortfalls if the insurer doesn’t pay the full amount requested, according to regulators.

Other states allow AOB agreements, but they have had a larger impact in Florida because of a state law that requires the insurer to pay attorneys’ fees if more money is awarded after a lawsuit than was initially offered. Insurers say the use of AOB agreements in Florida encourages contractors to overcharge insurers for repair work and perform more work than is needed.

Heritage Insurance in Clearwater, Fla., will pay out about $50 million more than it otherwise would have this year due to AOB claims, said Chief Executive Bruce Lucas.

In Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, where AOB lawsuits are most prevalent, Heritage’s average cost for a water claim has risen from $8,000 three years ago to $25,000, Mr. Lucas said.

Some lawyers, consumer advocates and contractors say AOB agreements can help homeowners who are unfamiliar with the claims process and don’t know how to navigate the system. Many homeowners are frustrated when some insurers can take days or even weeks to send adjusters to inspect damage, said Sha’Ron James, Florida’s insurance consumer advocate.

“The lawyers have found an opening,” Ms. James said. “They realized there are a lot of unhappy consumers.”

Some contractors say the agreements also ensure builders are paid fairly for their work. “Unless I have an assignment of benefit, I may not get paid, or I won’t get paid the right amount,” said David DeBlander, president of Pro Clean Restoration and Cleaning in Pensacola, Fla.

More than 28,000 AOB lawsuits were filed in Florida in 2016, up from 405 in 2006, according to the state’s Department of Financial Services. Through July of this year, more than 20,000 AOB lawsuits were filed.

Insurers and regulators warn that AOB costs could accelerate rate increases in the state. When HCI Group Inc.’s Homeowners Choice unit requested a 3.3% rate increase from Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation this year, regulators told the company the increase wasn’t sufficient to cover its rising AOB costs. An actuarial analysis indicated a hike of 19% was justified. The insurer ended up increasing its rates by 8%.

Earlier this year, state insurance regulators unsuccessfully sought legislation to curb AOB lawsuits by limiting the instances in which insurers are required to pay attorneys’ fees. Lawmakers are taking up the issues again, and the new effort is in the early stages.

Some law firms say insurers are trying to take homeowners’ rights away in pursuing legislation to reduce AOB lawsuits. One firm, Cohen Law Group in Maitland, Fla., holds AOB workshops for vendors ​to “show you the insider secrets that the insurance companies don’t want you to know,” its website says.

Not all homeowners are embracing the agreements. Brooke Fehr, a magazine editor in Sanford, Fla., tried to get repair estimates from about five roofing companies after Irma. All but one wouldn’t look at her roof unless she signed an AOB contract, she said.

After seeing warnings from state regulators and her insurance company, she decided not to sign. “It’s really tough to be put into this position,” Ms. Fehr said. “You’re basically told nobody will do business with you if you don’t [assign benefits], but the state is saying absolutely don’t do business this way.”

The state warns consumers not to sign anything before talking to their insurance companies. It has been issuing these warnings since at least 2016.

Ms. Laub, the homeowner in New Smyrna Beach, refused to sign any assignment of benefits contracts following her house fire.

She had signed one earlier in the year for roof damage and regretted it, because the roofing company turned out to be unreliable.

“Once they have that assignment of benefits, the policyholder is kind of out of the loop,” she said.

"It is still true: What begins as tragedy can end as farce. So it is with the case of Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of assaulting her when she was 15 and he was 17.

As of the most recent available moment in this episode, Ms. Ford’s lawyer said her client would not appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee until there is a “full investigation by law-enforcement officials.” Like the Mueller excavations, that could run to the horizon, unable to find anything but unwilling to stop until it finds something.

Let us posit that the one thing not at issue here is the truth. As a matter of law and fact, Ms. Ford’s accusation can be neither proved nor disproved. This is as obvious now as it must have been when Dianne Feinstein and the other Democrats came into possession of this incident.

Surely someone pointed out that based on what was disclosed, this accusation could not be substantiated. To which the Democrats responded: So what? Its political value is that it cannot be disproved. They saw that six weeks before a crucial midterm election, the unresolvable case of Christine Blasey Ford would sit like a stalled hurricane over the entire Republican Party, drowning its candidates in a force they could not stop.

In #MeToo, which began in the predations of Harvey Weinstein, Democrats and progressives finally have found a weapon against which there seems to be no defense. It can be used to exterminate political enemies. If one unprovable accusation doesn’t suffice, why not produce a second, or third? It’s a limitless standard.

The Democrats’ broader strategy is: Delay the vote past the election; win the Senate by convincing suburban women that Republicans are implacably hostile to them; seize power; and—the point of it all—take down the Trump government.

This is the “resistance.” This is what Democrats have become. Resistance is a word and strategy normally found in a revolutionary context, which is precisely the argument made by the left to justify its actions against this presidency since the evening of Nov. 8, 2016. Anything goes. Whatever it takes. Brett Kavanaugh is not much more than a casualty of war.

Rather than try to argue or win public issues on substance, the Democrats have become a party that seems to think it can win with muscle alone. Environmentalism emerged in the 1970s as a worthwhile idea that attracted the interest and support of both parties. From Al Gore onward, it became a bludgeon to beat up the other party. Now sexual abuse, an issue originating in utmost seriousness, has been quickly captured and fashioned into a political weapon by the Democratic left.

Politics as trench warfare has relieved the Democrats of the burden of thought. Extending the Pelosi Rule—we have to pass the bill to find out what’s in it—we now have the Gillibrand Standard.

Commenting this week on Ford v. Kavanaugh, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, another 2020 presidential aspirant, said, “I believe it is disqualifying, given what we know.” In other words, what she believes is based on next to nothing.

Put on defense by these accusations, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley unsurprisingly agreed to a hearing in which Ms. Ford would tell her story and Judge Kavanaugh would speak. Then the senators would vote.

Consider the spectacle: Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination for the U.S. Supreme Court, the embodiment of a modern rule of law, is being decided in the Senate by the medieval practice of trial by ordeal, such as surviving immersion in fire or ice. Trial by ordeal was outlawed by the Lateran Council in 1215.

Or worse, the standards of the mob in the Roman Colosseum, turning thumbs up or down on the combatants. Though unlike the Senate Democrats, the Roman mob at least had an open mind.

Incidentally, the standard trope that Donald Trump has degraded our politics? We don’t need to hear that anymore. Or about the moral certitudes of the religious right.

Is there a sadder figure in the modern Democratic Party than Sen. Dianne Feinstein? Elected to the Senate in 1992, Mrs. Feinstein has produced a creditable career. Her above-it-all reputation was never quite deserved, but she has at least performed with dignity.

Now, seeking re-election at 85, she is getting heat from the progressive-dominated Democratic Party in California, the world capital of identity-only politics. By withholding from the committee the accusatory Ford letter that came into her possession nearly two months ago, Sen. Feinstein ensured the nomination’s descent into such a hapless, cynical moment. This will be the most remembered event in Sen. Feinstein’s career.

The Kavanaugh nomination, “given what we know,” has come down to an undiscoverable accusation. The defeat of a Supreme Court nominee on this basis would be a victory for a level of conscious political nullification not seen in the U.S. for a long time. Republicans in the Senate shouldn’t allow it, and voters in November should not affirm it.

"The consolidation of Australian television assets helped News Corp NWSA 0.39% boost revenue substantially in the June quarter, but also led to a write-off that weighed on the company’s bottom line.

News Corp in April completed the merger of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, and wound up with a controlling stake in the resulting entity, which is now one of the largest pay-TV, sports and entertainment outlets in Australia.

The deal helped propel a 29% increase in year-over-year revenue to $2.69 billion. Adjusted revenue, which factors out the effects of the Foxtel transaction, rose 5.2%.

The results also were boosted by strong sales and profit growth at the company’s book-publishing and digital-real-estate divisions.

At the company’s news and information-services business, the largest unit that houses publications such as The Wall Street Journal, Times of London and New York Post, revenue increased 1% compared with the year-earlier quarter.

“News Corp is now a more substantial company after the Foxtel transaction, with a much higher percentage of recurring, subscription-based revenues, which should help offset a volatile advertising environment,” said News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson in a written statement.

Charges related to the Foxtel transaction contributed to a net loss of $372 million, compared with a loss of $430 million in the year-earlier quarter.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 45% to $312 million.

When leaving out the merger-related charges, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 8 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast revenue of $2.65 billion and earnings per share of 6 cents.

In the news unit, circulation revenue gains were boosted by a 9% increase at Dow Jones, the Journal’s publisher. The Journal added 100,000 digital subscribers in the quarter. In the June quarter, the Journal averaged 1.59 million digital subscribers.

Advertising revenue for the entire news unit declined 2%, while circulation and subscription revenue increased 5%.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization declined 9% in the news unit. That was because of higher costs at Dow Jones and lower revenue at News Corp’s papers in Australia.

The digital-real-estate business posted a 19% increase in revenue to $299 million. Ebitda rose 14% in the division.

Revenue in News Corp’s book-publishing segment rose 20% to $490 million, boosted by strong sales of “Magnolia Table,” by Joanna Gaines, “I’ll Be Gone in the Dark,” by Michelle McNamara and “Girl Wash Your Face,” by Rachel Hollis. Ebitda for the unit rose 82%.

"Congressional lawmakers have left a proposal to regulate airline “change fees” out of a bill authorizing the Federal Aviation Administration’s operations.

A version of the FAA bill released on Saturday doesn’t include a provision that would have given the Department of Transportation oversight of the fees airlines charge passengers to change their reservations, according to a summary of the legislation and to spokesmen for the House and Senate transportation committees.

An earlier draft version of the bill approved by a Senate committee had included the change-fee provision.

The latest version of the bill was negotiated by House and Senate lawmakers who aim to hold a vote in both chambers ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline to reauthorize the FAA’s operating authority.

Excluding the change-fee provision is a victory for U.S. airlines and their trade group, Airlines for America. U.S. airlines took in nearly $3 billion from change and cancellation fees last year, federal data show. They pushed hard for Congress not to regulate that revenue stream, arguing it would upend their business model.

The bill does include a provision directing the FAA to set minimums for leg room and the width and length of commercial airline seats.

The airline group said the FAA bill “will provide long-term certainty for the millions of passengers and countless businesses that rely on access to safe, affordable travel and shipping options every day.”

Sen. Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.), who had pushed for the change-fee provision, blamed airlines for its defeat. “Congress had the opportunity to return fairness to change and cancellation fees,” he said in a statement. “Instead, through an opaque negotiating process, the airlines have managed to kill this important consumer protection provision. No one should have to pay a $200 change fee on a ticket that costs nearly that much.”

The compromise legislation, which could reach the House floor as early as next week, also includes several provisions pushed by industry groups related to expanding uses of commercial drones and promoting a return of civil supersonic aircraft to the U.S.

Prodded by advocates of such planes, lawmakers called on the FAA to develop criteria authorizing certification of future models producing reduced sonic booms. To start with, prospective manufactures want the agency to establish noise standards during takeoffs and landings at conventional speeds. But eventually, companies and industry groups will seek approval for civilian supersonic flights over the U.S. that are now prohibited.

In addition, the legislation endorses accelerated and expanded operations of unmanned aircraft, flown for both commercial and governmental purposes. House and Senate members agreed, among other things, that the FAA should rely on consensus industry standards when approving certain drone designs. The bill also envisions that within a year, FAA leaders will spell out plans to broaden existing rules to accommodate regular flights of package-delivery drones. The agency has repeatedly missed similar legislative deadlines over the years, largely due to technical and legal challenges. FAA efforts to allow more widespread drone flights also continue to be impeded by security and law-enforcement concerns over hazards posed by rogue operators or terrorists. Until those issues are resolved, the FAA will remain stymied in implementing many of the goals highlighted in the bill.

However, in a big win for Amazon.com Inc. and many other companies pushing to deliver packages to consumers using relatively small, highly automated unmanned aerial systems, the bill specifically calls for consideration of drones weighing more than 55 pounds including cargo.

By late 2019, the FAA also will be required to provide congress a plan for implementing an air-traffic control network focused on drone operations. And lawmakers want reports from industry and government experts laying out finding proposals for regulating the fast-growing commercial drone industry.

In another closely watched portion of the bill, for the first time in more than two decades the legislation mandates longer rest periods for flight attendants between duty days.

"Daphne Sheldrick rarely met an animal she didn’t want to nuzzle. Her menagerie over the years included a warthog named Grunter and a civet fond of being sprinkled with Old Spice shaving lotion. Her deepest love, however, was for elephants.

She created and ran the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, named after her late husband, who developed and managed parklands and animal refuges in Kenya. The trust, founded in 1977, operates a nursery at Nairobi National Park, where orphaned baby elephants are raised and prepared to return to the wild. It also educates young people about wildlife and fights poaching by bandits seeking elephant tusks and rhino horns for export to Asia.

Baby elephants often are orphaned when their mothers are killed by poachers, fall into wells or succumb to drought. By trial and error, Ms. Sheldrick found that a baby formula containing coconut oil was the best way to nurture her wrinkly orphans. “You have to mix gallons, not pints,” she wrote in a memoir.

She described herself as a “surrogate mother” and trained African keepers to help her raise the orphans, feeding them once every three hours and staying near them around the clock.

Ms. Sheldrick died of breast cancer April 12 in Nairobi. She was 83.

She blamed human greed and ignorance for depleting the elephant population in Africa and was disdainful of the widespread belief in Asia that rhino horns are a cure for ailments including rheumatism and impotence. Rhino horns are composed of keratin, also found in fingernails, “so consumers could get the same thing simply through biting their nails,” she wrote in her 2012 memoir “Love, Life and Elephants.”

The trust she created urges donors to “foster” elephants for $50 a year and up.

Daphne Marjorie Jenkins was born June 4, 1934, and grew up on a farm near Gilgil, about 80 miles northwest of Nairobi. Her family had emigrated from Britain to Kenya via South Africa during British colonial days. She recalled a childhood of bonding with animals, wild and domesticated, and the occasional thrill of ice cream made from hailstones. Her life was less idyllic at a boarding school in Nakuru, Kenya, where, she wrote, a headmaster fondled girls’ breasts and forced those with low test scores to declaim, “I am stupid.”

Though a bright student, she ended her schooling at 16 and three years later married Bill Woodley, an assistant park warden. Mr. Woodley worked for David Sheldrick, who also grew up in a British colonial family and headed an effort to turn vast tracts of scrubland in Kenya’s Tsavo region into a national park that would attract overseas tourists and preserve wildlife.

Her passion for Mr. Woodley swiftly cooled. “My marriage, and sex in particular, fell far short of my girlhood expectations,” she wrote. Meanwhile, her attraction to Mr. Sheldrick—a dashing World War II veteran and self-taught authority on African wildlife—grew as she worked for him as an office assistant and accompanied him on trips into the wilds. She eventually obtained an amicable divorce from Mr. Woodley and married Mr. Sheldrick in 1960.

Her love of elephants survived a near-fatal encounter in 1994. Believing she recognized an elephant she knew as Eleanor, Ms. Sheldrick approached the animal among a herd at a watering hole and, in a friendly greeting, reached up to stroke it behind an ear.

Too late she realized the elephant wasn’t Eleanor. The surprised animal used its trunk to hurl her into a pile of boulders, shattering numerous bones. She needed surgeries and more than a year of therapy before she could walk normally again.

Her younger daughter, Angela Sheldrick, now runs the wildlife trust. Daphne Sheldrick—also known as Dame Daphne after being named a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire—is also survived by another daughter, Gillian Woodley, two sisters and four grandchildren.

She knew her elephants from tail to trunk, including their digestive tracts. She particularly appreciated the ears. “The hind side of an elephant’s ear is as soft and smooth to the touch as silk and always deliciously cool,” she wrote.

She also felt an emotional kinship. “Elephants are just like us, only better,” she told the Sunday Times of London in 2012. “They have emotions, relationships and an extraordinary memory. Once an elephant loves you, that love stands for life.”

"North Korea’s moratorium on missile test flights has precluded it from trying out the technology it would need to strike the U.S. with a nuclear-tipped ICBM, a top U.S. military officer said Friday.

While North Korea has demonstrated that it has nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, it hasn’t shown that it has mastered the complicated steps of delivering a warhead to the U.S. mainland, said Air Force Gen. Paul Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

To do that, Pyongyang needs to develop and test a reliable targeting system and a survivable re-entry vehicle, the portion of a missile that contains a nuclear warhead and which is designed to withstand the stress of re-entering the atmosphere.

“Our assessment is he has not closed those last two pieces of the kill chain,” Gen. Selva told the Air Force Association, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

U.S. and North Korean talks on eliminating North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs have been stymied, and Pyongyang has continued to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons.

But Gen. Selva’s comments underscore that some of the gestures North Korea has made—specifically, suspending nuclear and missile tests—have security benefits for the U.S.

“We have not seen a demonstration of a reliable R.V.,” said Gen. Selva, referring to the re-entry vehicle. “And we have not seen a demonstration of a reliable arming, targeting and fusing system that would allow the system to survive and actually detonate when he wants it to detonate.”

North Korea last year test fired intercontinental ballistic missiles that have the range to reach the U.S. But in carrying out those launches, it fired the missiles on “lofted” trajectories, in which they reached a high altitude but didn’t cover a great distance horizontally.

As a consequence, those test flights didn’t replicate the flight path a missile would take if it was fired at the U.S. On such a trajectory, a re-entry vehicle would go faster and would be subject to higher temperatures, experts say.

North Korea also hasn’t conducted a missile test flight since November.

“It has had an impact,” Gen. Selva said of the moratorium. “But we don’t know what impact it’s had on his logic,” he added, referring to Mr. Kim.

Even though North Korea hasn’t fully developed its ICBM capabilities, Gen. Selva said, it may think the system is good enough and try to use it in a crisis. So the Pentagon’s missile defense system needs to be prepared to intercept it, he said.

“We have to assume he might shoot one,” Gen. Selva said. “We would have to be prepared to defend. But we might actually make the choice not to shoot because we assert based on what we know about the system and its trajectory that it’s not going to hit anything.”

Joseph Bermudez, a military analyst for 38 North, a website on North Korean affairs, said that Pyongyang has already reaped political gains from its ICBM program despite its limitations.

“North Korea’s ballistic missile program has already enabled it to achieve its strategic goal of being perceived as an existential threat to the U.S.,” he said. “North Korea is at the center of the international stage.”

Yet Mr. D’Alessandro, a longtime Iowa Democratic political operative, appears from public polling set to place third in Tuesday’s Democratic primary. The Sanders seal of approval, for Mr. D’Alessandro and a handful of other Democrats, isn’t turning out to be a winning one in this year’s congressional elections.

“Bernie is Bernie, it’s a one-person movement,” said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic Party chairman for Polk County, which includes Des Moines.

If the Sanders machine can’t produce votes for a candidate who shares his policy platform, has a full-throated endorsement and remains connected to top volunteers, it raises the question of whether Mr. Sanders can turn out his voters for any candidate here and beyond.

The Sanders endorsement hasn’t spurred other Democrats to victory in contested House primaries.

Last month in Pennsylvania, Mr. Sanders backed Rich Lazer and Greg Edwards, who each finished third in Democratic congressional primaries in the Philadelphia suburbs. Marie Newman lost a hard-fought March primary for a congressional seat in Illinois 12 days after Mr. Sanders endorsed her.

Of House candidates with primary opponents Mr. Sanders has endorsed this year, only Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, in Illinois, has won. Mr. Garcia, widely considered their heir apparent to retiring Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez, prevailed by 45 percentage points in March.

Other candidates running on the Sanders platform—such as Kara Eastman in Nebraska—have won primaries against establishment-minded opponents without the benefit of the Vermont senator’s explicit support.

“Even candidates who don’t win can make a tremendous impact on the country and we saw that in the 2016 race,” said Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders’s chief political aide. “What is important is the number of candidates running on the issues that Bernie talked about in 2016. The issues that people are running on are getting advanced and we’re moving the agenda forward.”

An aide said Mr. Sanders didn’t have time to be interviewed. This weekend he hosted at a rally in Anaheim, Calif., to protest Walt Disney Co. ’s treatment of its theme park employees. Mr. Sanders hasn’t endorsed any of the Democrats running in Orange County’s contested primaries.

Mr. D’Alessandro’s distant third place showing in the Des Moines Register’s poll is the latest evidence that despite the political mainstreaming of Mr. Sanders’s once-considered-fringe policy ideas—such as implementing a single-payer health care system and a $15-per-hour minimum wage—his personal endorsements can’t carry candidates to victory in tough primaries.

Mr. D’Alessandro spent the past year trying to stitch back together the Sanders coalition he built during the state’s 2016 presidential caucuses to fight Hillary Clinton to a surprising draw.

During an interview in his campaign office last week, he said polling doesn’t account for Sanders backers who are infrequent participants in Democratic primaries.

Mr. D’Alessandro said he is a viable candidate only because of help from Mr. Sanders. The email solicitations from Mr. Sanders raised between $135,000 and $150,000—about half of the $283,000 he has raised, according to the latest campaign finance reports.

“I’m only able to make this race because Bernie Sanders changed the rules for someone like me, who can’t self-fund and doesn’t appeal to the $2,700 donors,” Mr. D’Alessandro said.

Leading the race, according to the Register’s poll, are Cindy Axne, a small-business owner backed by the pro-abortion rights group Emily’s List who has raised $548,000, and Eddie Mauro, an insurance company executive who has self-funded $350,000 of the $598,000 he has raised.

The Democratic primary winner will face GOP Rep. David Young, a two-term incumbent. His campaign said he is focused on his race, not the opposition’s primary.

President Donald Trump carried the district by 4 percentage points, but former President Barack Obama won it twice. The Cook Political Report lists it as “lean Republican” this November.

Ms. Axne said the district’s Democrats aren’t interested in branding themselves in the Sanders or Clinton camps.

“We’re all trying to get to the same outcomes,” Ms. Axne, who backed Mrs. Clinton in 2016, said at a West Des Moines coffee shop. “It’s just a little bit of variance in how we get there.”

Mr. Mauro, who backed former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley in the 2016 presidential race, called himself a “bold progressive” during a televised debate Thursday. Nobody in the congressional race, he said, has a claim on the Sanders coalition.

“Pete’s not Bernie Sanders,” Mr. Mauro said in an interview after the debate.

Even Mr. Sanders’s own family members have been unable to turn their connection to him into electoral success.

Mr. Sanders’s stepdaughter, Carina Driscoll, lost a March contest for mayor of Burlington, Vt., and his son, Levi, has raised just $11,000 in his run for Congress from an open seat in New Hampshire. Mr. Sanders hasn’t endorsed either of them.

“Levi will be running his own campaign, in his own way, with his own ideas,” he said in a statement to New Hampshire newspapers when his son launched his campaign.

"WASHINGTON—President Donald Trumpsigned a $1.3 trillion spending bill early Friday afternoon, but not before leaving both his staff and lawmakers on edge for four hours by tweeting he might veto it and trigger a government shutdown.

Just days earlier at the White House, the president assured House Speaker Paul Ryan he would sign the bill. A half-hour after the tweet, Mr. Ryan (R., Wis.) called the president and urged him to keep the promise, a congressional aide said.

White House aides huddled with Mr. Trump and warned him that he might catch blame for shutting down the government on a weekend he planned to spend at his Palm Beach, Fla., resort.

“F— that,” Mr. Trump said in rejecting the argument, according to people familiar with the discussion. In the end, he signed the bill in a West Wing ceremony but complained that it was so long no one had read it and warned Congress he wouldn’t sign another like it in the future.

It was another unscripted moment of political drama in a two-week run that has left the Republican president’s opponents—and some of his allies—off balance. As he settles into the second year of his four-year term, Mr. Trump is showcasing a more unilateral executive style that relies on his own judgment and sense of what the moment requires.

In a rapid-fire series of moves, Mr. Trump has reshaped his senior staff and reconfigured the legal team defending him in the Russia investigation. He agreed in short order to a meeting with the leader of North Korea. He launched a trade offensive against China. And he has taken more direct command of the messages and policy positions coming out of his administration.

Friends and former aides said he is relishing the focus and attention he is receiving with personnel and policy moves that at times have convulsed the capital. And they point to measures like the China trade tariffs and the agreement to talk to North Korea as innovations in U.S. policy that only a disrupter of the status quo could deliver on.

“He’s enjoying this,” said ex-White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. “Trump has his sea legs as president.”

Yet the approach carries risks, jeopardizing the White House’s credibility when a presidential tweet or unscripted comment collides with prepared statements crafted by his advisers, such as the long list of favorable talking points on the spending bill that his staff issued Thursday.

“Never been this wild,” said one White House official, summing up the last two weeks in the West Wing.

A top Republican House aide said Friday: “You have to take every statement of administration policy with a grain of salt because we all know it comes down to one man.”

A president who danced to the Frank Sinatra song, “My Way” at his inaugural celebration in 2017, Mr. Trump has never been reluctant to air his views. What aides and advisers said is different now is he is more apt to put his views into practice whether his advisers agree or not—and to do so to the surprise of his staff and at times contrary to previous public statements.

Last week, the president erupted amid reports that he was ready to fire national security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. “Total f— bullshit,” Mr. Trump told advisers, according to people familiar with the matter.

He ordered White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to dispel reports about Gen. McMaster, and Ms. Sanders tweeted that she had spoken to both men and that there “are no changes” at the National Security Council. On Thursday, Mr. Trump ousted Gen. McMaster hours after speaking to his successor, John Bolton, who himself appeared surprised that the announcement happened so quickly.

Also last week, Mr. Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by tweet without having personally told his top diplomat about his decision in advance, leaving the heads-up to his chief of staff, John Kelly.

He hired Lawrence Kudlow as director of the National Economic Council without telling his top aides, after Gary Cohn, his former top economic counselor, handed in his resignation earlier this month when Mr. Trump proceeded with steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Cohn opposed.

Mr. Trump handled much of the interview process on his own, and the president’s chief of staff didn’t meet Mr. Kudlow until Thursday—one week after Mr. Trump offered his new economic adviser the job.

And earlier this week, he ignored the advice of his national-security staff and congratulated Vladimir Putin on another term in office as Russia’s president. Mr. Trump has long said he wants warmer relations with Russia in hopes of winning Mr. Putin’s cooperation in other global trouble spots. One White House official said the advisers erred by “telling him you should think and do this,” rather than letting him improvise. “That’s a cardinal mistake with him,” the official said.

“He loves to break eggs and loves to negotiate,” Mr. Kudlow said. “That’s who you’ve got here.”

One presidential decision that has united his advisers—and was telegraphed well in advance—was the series of trade actions aimed at China, which were signed Thursday.

In the past year, the White House has been divided between those viewed as defending the multilateral global trading system and a more protectionist wing, including Mr. Trump, who believe it has ill-served the U.S.’s interests. The China action was supported by globalist aides—Mr. Cohn and Jared Kushner, a senior adviser and the president’s son-in-law—and those who champion protectionism, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.

To date, Mr. Trump has heeded advice on how to handle reports of his alleged affairs with women in the past, which he previously has denied. Privately, he has discussed with advisers whether he should publicly fight the allegations on Twitter or elsewhere.

His advisers have told him that there is no sign the allegations are hurting him with voters and have warned him that it would look inappropriate for the president to engage in a public spat with, among others, a former porn star. He has remained silent on the allegations, despite extensive coverage on the cable-news channels he watches closely, advisers said.

Mr. Bannon, who was ousted shortly after Mr. Kelly took over as chief of staff, suggested the president should further empower himself by abolishing the position of chief of staff in the White House and instead have a half-dozen or so senior officials report directly to him.

“That would revert to the management style he’s most comfortable with—it’s how he built the Trump Organization and ran the campaign,” said Mr. Bannon, referring to the president’s real-estate business. “It would remove the administrative obstacles and allow him to take direct action.”

On the spending bill, the president’s veto threat wasn’t made in a vacuum, aides said. As Congress negotiated the bill this week, White House aides signed off on crucial decisions, right up to the bill’s passage, according to a GOP congressional aide. Mr. Trump’s public criticism of the bill on Friday bristled many lawmakers, the aide said, because the White House had signed off on it.

But Mr. Trump had privately questioned all week whether he should sign it. Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, had urged him to veto it, saying the proposal didn’t include enough money for border security. By Friday morning, Mr. Trump had heard repeated complaints about the bill from conservative media outlets.

In the West Wing, both Marc Short, the president’s director of legislative affairs, and Mr. Kelly urged him to sign the bill, telling the president that he had promised he would and noting that it included record amounts of military spending. By midmorning Friday, aides weren’t sure which way he would go.

“I have no idea,” one White House official said, “what’s going to happen here.”

"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes appeared on “Fox & Friends” Tuesday, where he provided a potentially explosive hint at what’s driving his demand to see documents related to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Trump-Russia probe. “If the campaign was somehow set up,” he told the hosts, “I think that would be a problem.”

Or an understatement. Mr. Nunes is still getting stiff-armed by the Justice Department over his subpoena, but this week his efforts did force the stunning admission that the FBI had indeed spied on the Trump campaign. This came in the form of a Thursday New York Times apologia in which government “officials” acknowledged that the bureau had used “at least one” human “informant” to spy on both Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. The Times slipped this mind-bending fact into the middle of an otherwise glowing profile of the noble bureau—and dismissed it as no big deal.

But there’s more to be revealed here, and Mr. Nunes’s “set up” comment points in a certain direction. Getting to the conclusion requires thinking more broadly about events beyond the FBI’s actions.

Think of the 2016 Trump-Russia narrative as two parallel strands—one politics, one law enforcement. The political side involves the actions of Fusion GPS, the Hillary Clinton campaign and Obama officials—all of whom were focused on destroying Donald Trump. The law-enforcement strand involves the FBI—and what methods and evidence it used in its Trump investigation. At some point these strands intersected—and one crucial question is how early that happened.

What may well have kicked off both, however, is a key if overlooked moment detailed in the House Intelligence Committee’s recent Russia report. In “late spring” of 2016, then-FBI Director James Comey briefed White House “National Security Council Principals” that the FBI had counterintelligence concerns about the Trump campaign. Carter Page was announced as a campaign adviser on March 21, and Paul Manafort joined the campaign March 29. The briefing likely referenced both men, since both had previously been on the radar of law enforcement. But here’s what matters: With this briefing, Mr. Comey officially notified senior political operators on Team Obama that the bureau had eyes on Donald Trump and Russia. Imagine what might be done in these partisan times with such explosive information.

And what do you know? Sometime in April, the law firm Perkins Coie (on behalf the Clinton campaign) hired Fusion GPS, and Fusion turned its attention to Trump-Russia connections. The job of any good swamp operator is to gin up a fatal October surprise for the opposition candidate. And what could be more devastating than to paint a picture of Trump-Russia collusion that would provoke a full-fledged FBI investigation?

We already know of at least one way Fusion went about that project, with wild success. It hired former British spy Christopher Steele to compile that infamous dossier. In July, Mr. Steele wrote a memo that leveled spectacular conspiracy theories against two particular Trump campaign members—Messrs. Manafort and Page. For an FBI that already had suspicions about the duo, those allegations might prove huge—right? That is, if the FBI were to ever see them. Though, lucky for Mrs. Clinton, July is when the Fusion team decided it was a matter of urgent national security for Mr. Steele to play off his credentials and to take this political opposition research to the FBI.

The question Mr. Nunes’s committee seems to be investigating is what other moments—if any—were engineered in the spring, summer or fall of 2016 to cast suspicion on Team Trump. The conservative press has produced some intriguing stories about a handful of odd invitations and meetings that were arranged for Messrs. Page and Papadopoulos starting in the spring—all emanating from the United Kingdom. On one hand, that country is home to the well-connected Mr. Steele, which could mean the political actors with whom he was working were involved. On the other hand, the Justice Department has admitted it was spying on both men, which could mean government was involved. Or maybe . . . both.

Which brings us to timing. It’s long been known that Mr. Steele went to the FBI in early July to talk about the dossier, and that’s the first known intersection of the strands. But given the oddity and timing of those U.K. interactions concerning Messrs. Page and Papadopoulos, and given the history of some of the people involved in arranging them, some wonder if the two strands were converging earlier than anyone has admitted. The Intelligence Committee subpoena is designed to sort all this out: Who was pulling the strings, and what was the goal? Information? Or entrapment?

Whatever the answer—whether it is straightforward, or whether it involves political chicanery—Congress and the public have a right to know. And a Justice Department willing to leak details of its “top secret” source to friendly media can have no excuse for not sharing with the duly elected members of Congress.

"LONDON—President Donald Trump spent Saturday at his golf resort in Scotland as 9,000 protesters marched through the country’s capital of Edinburgh, while pro-Trump demonstrators in London responded to the previous day’s far larger march against the president.

In a video captured by a BBC reporter Saturday, Mr. Trump waved at demonstrators outside his Turnberry golf course, who were chanting, “No Trump, no KKK, no racist U.S.A.” A paraglider flew over Turnberry with a banner that read: “Trump: well below par #resist.” U.S. reporters requested access to his golf course, but were denied by the White House.

Scottish police said that in addition to the 9,000 protesters in Edinburgh, some 2,000 people demonstrated against Mr. Trump in Glasgow.

In London’s Trafalgar Square, demonstrators marched in support of the U.S. president and on behalf of Tommy Robinson, the former leader of the far-right anti-Islamist group the English Defense League, who was jailed earlier this year for contempt of court.

On Friday, while Mr. Trump met with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May and Queen Elizabeth II outside of London, tens of thousands of protesters had marched against the president in the city as well as outside of Chequers, the prime minister’s country house, and Windsor Castle. Protesters also inflated a balloon outside the Houses of Parliament depicting the U.S. leader as an orange baby.

The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment on the protests.

Mr. Trump tweeted Saturday morning that he would be spending the weekend on “meetings, calls and hopefully, some golf—my primary form of exercise!” He also promoted his Scottish golf course, saying, “This place is incredible!”

The president’s visit to Scotland capped a tumultuous swing through Brussels, where he clashed with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies over military spending, and England, where he began his visit by publicly criticizing the prime minister’s approach to Brexit and ended by describing their relationship as “the highest level of special.”

On Sunday evening he is set to travel to Helsinki, where he is scheduled to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Those talks come days after Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Friday indicted a dozen Russian agents accused of hacking Democratic Party computers during the 2016 presidential election.

Mr. Trump on Saturday cast the blame for Moscow’s interference in part on his predecessor. “These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn’t Obama do something about it?” he tweeted.

Former President Barack Obama in September 2016 confronted Mr. Putin about election meddling. The next month, the U.S. intelligence community accused the Russian government of trying to interfere in the coming U.S. elections by purposely leaking emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and other entities. Moscow has denied meddling in the election.

Critics have said Mr. Obama could have acted sooner or more decisively.

Mr. Trump has said he plans to confront Mr. Putin over election interference, but suggested he had limited options.

“All I can do is say, ‘Did you?’ and ‘Don’t do it again,’ Mr. Trump said on Thursday. “But he may deny it.”

MEXICO CITY—As Mexicans prepare to cast ballots Sunday in an election dominated by anger over endemic violence and corruption, few voters are talking about the wave of Central American migrants that has transfixed the American public in recent days.

The basic reason: The vast majority of migrants crossing Mexico have no intention of settling here.

“Mexico is not their destination,” said José Antonio Crespo, a political analyst at Mexico City’s CIDE university. “At the end of the day, Mexican voters are worried by our own problems—corruption, violence and the economy.”

Mexicans have been shocked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s longstanding hostility toward undocumented migration and his plans to erect a wall along the border. But even as controversy intensified in the U.S. this month after the Trump administration began prosecuting illegal migrants and separating migrant children from their parents, the issue has barely surfaced on the agendas of the country’s presidential candidates.

“It’s not on the public radar,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute. “It’s been a blip on the screen, politically.”

While Mr. Trump’s has said Mexico does little to stop immigrants from reaching the U.S., Mexico has deported more Central American migrants than the U.S. in each of the last three fiscal years, according to an analysis of U.S. and Mexican official statistics by the institute.

In April, Mr. Trump also criticized the Mexican government for not stopping and sending back a caravan of 1,200 Central American migrants seeking to get to the U.S. border. The caravan disbanded after the Mexican government offered humanitarian visas to those who wanted to apply for asylum in Mexico, as others proceeded to the U.S.-Mexico border. Mr. Trump deployed National Guard troops to the border later that month.

Last week, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said Mexico doesn’t promote illegal immigration and condemned the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents as “cruel and inhumane.”

Mexico’s own southern border, with Guatemala, remains very porous, despite Mexico’s efforts in recent years—largely at the prodding of the U.S.—to increase security personnel and dramatically boost the number of migrants it deports. While the U.S. pushes for still more controls to stanch the northern flow, some domestic critics of Mexico’s immigration policy say the country doesn’t do enough to provide asylum to people in fear of their lives, said Tonatiuh Guillén, an immigration expert and former president of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte.

Most migrants trying to sneak to the U.S. from Mexico are fleeing gang violence, lack of jobs and grinding poverty in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. They must embark on a treacherous 2,500-mile trek across Mexico to reach the opportunities and safety of the U.S.

“They are invisible for Mexican society,” said Melissa Ley, an immigration expert at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Monterrey, Mexico’s northern industrial hub. “Central American migration is not a topic of discussion.”

Leading presidential candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador has visited several U.S. cities over the past year to voice support for Mexican migrants living in the U.S., who are also eligible to vote in Mexico’s presidential election.

But little attention is devoted to the more than 250,000 Central American migrants who cross Mexico every year on their way to the U.S. Few of them stay. About 100,000 people from Central America’s so-called Northern Triangle live in Mexico, according to estimates from the Colegio de la Frontera Norte. More than 4.5 million people of Salvadoran, Guatemalan and Honduran origin live in the U.S., according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

In Mexico, many migrants risk harassment, kidnapping, extortion and murder from organized-crime groups and often-corrupt immigration authorities and even from police.

“They are mistreated as soon as they enter Mexico, abused by everyone: authorities, security forces, organized crime and society in general,” said Bishop Raúl Vera. His diocese in the border state of Coahuila runs several shelters, including the Casa del Migrante in the capital, Saltillo, which provides food and shelter to some 6,000 migrants, most of them young adults from Central America.

For Central Americans fleeing violence and badly paid jobs, Mexico doesn’t offer much relief. In Reynosa, a migrant hub across the Rio Grande from McAllen, Texas, killings and shootouts are almost daily occurrences as rival drug gangs fight turf wars to control key routes to smuggle drugs and migrants. Extortion is common and the city’s streets, lined with boarded-up storefronts, are deserted at night. Other border towns in Tamaulipas state such as Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros have also been engulfed by criminal violence.

Immigrants seeking to cross the Mexican border with the U.S. are easy targets for the drug gangs, who often kidnap them and hold them for ransom. In 2010, in the single worst massacre of Mexico’s drug war, members of the vicious Zetas cartel in Tamaulipas killed 72 undocumented migrants who were headed for the U.S.

“Mexico is in such bad shape right now that violence and impunity are just overwhelming, crowding out other relevant topics that should be discussed in this election,” Bishop Vera said.

Another reason why Central Americans usually don’t stay in Mexico is that they have little family here, as many do in the U.S. Family networks are key to settle in and find jobs.

“We don’t know anybody here,” said Isidro Sacasa, a 37-year-old Honduran who is staying at a shelter in Reynosa while preparing to cross the border. “What sense would it make for us to stay here?”

"At a meeting with GOP senators on Monday night, President Trump reportedly said that Republicans would look like “dopes” if they couldn’t pass a health-care bill. “If the Republicans have the House, the Senate and the presidency and they can’t pass this health-care bill, they are going to look weak,” Politico reports Mr. Trump said. “How can we not do this after promising it for years?”

I don’t often agree with Mr. Trump, but I do this time. He has posed a fair question that requires an answer.

Here’s my crack at an explanation: Campaigning is one thing, governing another. Opposing is not the same as legislating. Republicans had seven years to coalesce around a replacement for ObamaCare, and they wasted them. The bill they passed in 2015 was for show; they knew that President Obama would veto it and that they would not have to take responsibility for its consequences. Republicans are a majority party, but they have yet to prove that they are a governing party.

After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s effort to broker a compromise collapsed Monday evening, the president tweeted that “Republicans should just REPEAL failing Obamacare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate.” In a burst of enthusiastic fantasy, he added that “Dems will join in!”

No, they won’t, and some Republicans won’t either. Just hours after Mr. McConnell declared his intention to bring the bill the House passed earlier this year to the floor and then move the 2015 bill as the first amendment, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska announced their opposition, refusing to repeal ObamaCare without simultaneously replacing it.

“I did not come to Washington to hurt people,” Ms. Capito said. “I cannot vote to repeal ObamaCare without a replacement plan that addresses my concerns and the needs of West Virginians.”

Although these three senators were out in front, I doubt they were speaking only for themselves. In 2015 the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the ObamaCare repeal plan passed by the Senate would result in lost insurance coverage for 22 million Americans if enacted. Republicans are already concerned about the coverage losses their current proposals would produce. Why would they back repeal legislation that would do no better while throwing the entire health-care sector into turmoil until they were able to agree on a replacement?

There is a way forward, and Mr. McConnell has pointed to it. Republicans and Democrats could sit down together to negotiate much-needed fixes to ObamaCare’s troubled health-insurance exchanges. With even a modicum of goodwill on both sides, this would not be “Mission: Impossible.”

Along with bipartisanship, Mr. McConnell should do what he promised—return the Senate to regular order. Explaining his decision to deliver the coup de grâce to the McConnell bill, Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran criticized the “closed-door process” that had produced the bill and called on his party’s leaders to “start fresh with an open legislative process.” I suspect the American people would welcome this shift.

This episode reveals some larger truths. One is that the Republican coalition disagrees on fundamentals. Small-government conservatives want to reduce spending and cut regulations as a matter of principle, and they are willing to accept the human and political consequences. Others—for whom Sen. Capito spoke—focus on the needs of their constituents. Although they prefer market solutions, they are willing to accept public-sector action when markets fail—even if this means a permanent expansion of government.

Last month the Urban Institute estimated that more than 200,000 of Ms. Capito’s constituents would lose access to health care if the Senate bill became law. The bill’s draconian cuts to Medicaid would have driven these losses, and the working-class West Virginians who voted for Donald Trump in droves would have been hit the hardest. Low-income Americans just don’t earn enough to purchase health insurance in the private market. This reality—not abstractions about the role of government—drove her choice.

In addition, the United States has an aging population. In coming decades, tens of millions more elderly Americans will need help with the normal activities of daily life, and many will end up in nursing homes. Most Americans of average income will be unable to save enough to afford more than a few months in such institutions, let alone the years that many end up staying. This is why Medicaid finances a large share of nursing-home costs—and why these outlays are bound to rise for the foreseeable future.

Yes, reforms are possible. But more than anything else, it is hard-to-change economic realities and immutable demographic trends that drive federal government expenditures. Sooner or later, Republicans will have to make their peace with these stubborn facts.",politics

"WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump said Republicans should wait until they have more solid majorities in Congress to pursue an immigration overhaul, throwing cold water on a House bill that has been delayed until next week.

“Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November,” he wrote on Twitter on Friday. “Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything that solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!”

Republicans currently hold majorities of 51-49 in the Senate and 235-193 in the House. Some election watchers see Democrats making gains in the House in the midterm elections this fall, and perhaps winning back majority control.

Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.), chief deputy whip, said Friday that the planned immigration vote will move ahead despite the flagging support for the effort, citing party leaders’ promise to GOP moderates.

Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) had agreed to hold the vote on what Republicans called a compromise bill to head off a special maneuver called a discharge petition that would have allowed centrist Republicans to join with Democrats to bring their own immigration bills to the floor.

”There’s no significant dynamic shift in our conference on immigration,” Mr. McHenry said, when asked if there was sufficient support to pass the consensus bill. As for Mr. Trump’s tweet, he said: “The president is speaking truth. If you want to fix immigration crisis in a holistic way, you’re going to need Democrats to participate in this process.”

Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, has rejected labeling the bill a compromise, saying its provisions on Dreamers—young immigrants brought to the country as minors and living in the U.S. without authorization—and the zero-tolerance policy of charging adult illegal immigrants are too harsh for her party to accept. No Democrats were expected to support the measure.

House Republican leaders had seen Mr. Trump’s salesmanship as essential to pushing an immigration plan through the House. The Republican president shifted his position on the compromise bill several times over the past week, first rejecting it, then supporting it, and now saying it should be put off until after the November election.

Mr. Trump also moved this week to change a policy that had resulted in thousands of children being separated from their parents at the border. Mr. Trump issued an executive order that keeps his zero-tolerance stance on arresting illegal border crossers in place but directs that families be kept together. While welcomed by many lawmakers, it again shifted the playing field for the legislative negotiations.

The president’s support of the compromise bill had given some Republicans political cover, particularly from conservative critics who charged that granting protected status to young immigrants amounted to amnesty. With that support now gone, the bill’s future was more in doubt.

“I would say his tweet doesn’t help,” said Rep. Don Bacon (R., Neb.), who is supporting the compromise bill. “I just feel like this is an opportunity to get something done and I feel like we owe it to do our part in the House.”

Rep. Louie Gohmert (R., Texas) said the president was under pressure to back the compromise bill to bring hard-line immigration conservatives like himself on board and was glad to see Mr. Trump push back.

“The president realized that this is not a bill that we ought to be dying on because it’s time to move on. We’ll get a better bill later,” he said.

The compromise immigration bill would provide $23.4 billion for border security—including a wall and surveillance technology—and would cut family-based immigration and eliminate a diversity-visa lottery program. It would also provide six years of legal status to the young immigrants.

The vote on that plan was delayed Thursday after rank-and-file House Republicans pressed leaders to make additional changes to the measure. Some conservatives complained that the compromise omitted a requirement that employers use the E-Verify system to check workers’ immigration status, while other lawmakers wanted reassurances on how the legislation addressed the parents of Dreamers.

Several Senate Republicans have introduced their own, narrow, legislation that focuses on how asylum cases are handled at the border. That bill would codify Mr. Trump’s zero-tolerance policy for border crossers and keep families seeking asylum united in detention centers. It would authorize 225 new immigration judges and require the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize resolving family cases. Sens. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) are also working on bipartisan legislation.

"Charmaine Anderson thought she had a strong case against Waffle House.

Ms. Anderson claimed the diner chain fired her in 2012 from her $3.95-an-hour waitress job near New Orleans after she complained about her boss, whom she accused of texting her images of his penis, then threatening her with a knife if she reported him.

Her plans to pursue the claim unraveled when her attorney discovered after filing suit that Ms. Anderson, like other Waffle House workers, had signed an agreement mandating she settle any employment-related claims through arbitration instead of civil court.

Her attorney advised her that it wasn’t worth taking it to arbitration. Without a lawyer, she dropped it. “I knew I couldn’t fight it so I just let it go,” said Ms. Anderson, now 42 years old and living unemployed in Mississippi. “It was a humiliating situation. I felt like I was nobody and didn’t have a chance.”

More companies are adopting the mandatory-arbitration clauses, and many employees are walking away from harassment, wrongful-termination and discrimination claims rather than taking them to a privately run tribunal, according to experts and new research.

The percentage of nonunion, private-sector employees covered by the mandatory-arbitration clauses has more than doubled since the early 2000s, according to a 2017 study by a Cornell University professor and sponsored by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.

In many cases, workers drop the claims because they can’t get lawyers to take their cases. Plaintiffs’ lawyers say they are reluctant to represent arbitration clients on contingency fees because potential settlement and award payouts are generally lower than in court.

Ms. Anderson’s former attorney, Glenn McGovern of Metairie, La., said plaintiffs’ employment lawyers generally avoid arbitration “like a plague.” Kansas City plaintiffs’ attorney Dennis E. Egan of Popham Law Firm, P.C., who specializes in discrimination lawsuits, has a rule against representing arbitration clients. When they call, “I say, I’m sorry, arbitration is stacked against you,” he said.

Before Ms. Anderson’s case was dismissed in court in 2013, Waffle House had pushed back on her allegations, disputing even that the man she accused was her supervisor, according to court records.

“This is a six-year-old matter,” a spokesman said last week in a statement. “Since there was never any effort by Ms. Anderson to pursue arbitration, we consider this matter closed.”

In an atmosphere of rising awareness of sexual harassment stemming from the #MeToo movement, an estimated tens of millions of American employees work for companies that require disputes with their employers be adjudicated through arbitration, according to the study by the Cornell professor. The employees include a range of occupations—from waitresses to brewery workers to financial executives.

Arbitration involves trial-like hearings, often conducted by former judges or lawyers. Employers typically assume the costs of the arbitration service if it is mandated, but both parties have a say in deciding who hears the case, drawing names from a roster. Arbitrators usually don’t follow federal rules of civil procedure and, compared with courts, impose tighter limits on pretrial discovery. Arbitration cases are generally confidential and harder to appeal.

The business community says arbitration is a cheaper, faster and simpler way to adjudicate claims. But critics say the system is secretive and unfair to workers. Some lawmakers in Congress are currently pushing to restrict mandatory arbitration in cases of sexual harassment.

Many defense lawyers say the push to arbitration has led to an appropriate culling of weaker claims. Kenneth Willner, an employment lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP, said arbitration offers “more consistent decision-making that’s more attuned to the law” as compared with jury trials, where verdicts and awards are more unpredictable.

Others believe arbitration is keeping large numbers of worthy claims from being heard.

In a new draft paper titled, “The Black Hole of Mandatory Arbitration,” New York University labor and employment law professor Cynthia Estlund concluded that the great bulk of employment disputes subject to mandatory arbitration agreements “simply evaporate before they are even filed.”

It isn’t clear how many sexual-harassment claims are heard in arbitration but the evidence suggests it is a relatively small number. The American Arbitration Association says it received about 100 sexual-harassment claims in 2016, representing about 3.5% of the group’s employment cases, and that the numbers haven’t fluctuated much year-to-year. The group is the largest arbitration forum in the country and administers roughly half of all mandatory employment arbitration cases, according to researchers.

The next largest arbitration forum in the country, called JAMS, declined to say how many harassment cases it receives, saying it doesn’t keep track.

The number of employees alleging sexual harassment in the U.S. isn’t known. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission receives close to 7,000 complaints a year about sexual harassment from employees, who are required to notify the agency about discrimination allegations before bringing a federal a lawsuit

Pennsylvania State University labor-relations professor Mark Gough says for many lawyers, the aversion toward arbitration comes from a simple financial calculation about potential payouts. Plaintiffs’ lawyers he surveyed in a new study told him that settlements on average are $12,000 less for clients covered by the clauses.

Some believe the focus of any changes to the current system should be finding ways to ensure that claims with merit are heard.

“That screening impact is much more important than what happens to the minuscule number of claims that are taken to arbitration,” said Jean Sternlight, a University of Nevada law professor who specializes in dispute resolution.

"Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton and his fellow Princeton University professor and wife, Anne Case, made headlines two years ago when they reported that mortality rates among white, working-class Americans are going up in contrast to other demographic groups in the U.S.

Since then, the two have continued to dig into what is behind the increase in “deaths of despair” among white, middle-aged Americans with low levels of education.

They sat down with Wall Street Journal News Editor Janet Adamy to discuss their latest findings. Edited excerpts follow.

Two Americas

MS. ADAMY: You were here two years ago. Since then, Donald Trump has been elected president. The opioid crisis has worsened. What has your research found since then?

DR. DEATON: We’ve dug a lot deeper into the details. We’ve discovered that it was no flash in the pan. The numbers were correct. Bad things are really happening, and they’re continuing to happen.

We dug down a lot more into the educational differences and found that it is very much a two-Americas situation, where people with bachelor’s degrees are doing pretty well and those without them aren’t doing very well at all.

MS. ADAMY: And you discovered that the mortality rates among this population of white Americans have worsened in a way that has no historical precedent?

DR. DEATON: That’s right. You can find episodes like the flu epidemic or wartimes when mortality rates go up, but sustained increases in mortality for any major group in any society are really quite rare. It’s an indication that something is very wrong.

ANGUS DEATON | ‘Something is very wrong.’ Photo: Paul Morse for The Wall Street Journal

MS. ADAMY: Anne, why exactly is this happening?

DR. CASE: I think there are several answers to that. Mortality rates for suicide, for drug overdose, for alcoholism are rising for people without a college degree. Those are the big increases that we’re seeing, and it isn’t just about the financial crisis. This started back as far as we can break out education in death certificates, which is 1990. It has been a slow, steady trend up in all three of those for people without a B.A.

In addition to that, we’ve stopped making progress on heart disease in the U.S., which is stunning. Every other country continues to watch mortality fall. Antihypertensives and people stopping smoking had huge effects on deaths from heart disease. But our mortality rates from heart disease have flatlined and that’s a really big killer. So we have to better understand why that has happened in the U.S.

MS. ADAMY: There is a stark difference in terms of what is happening in the U.S. versus our peer countries. Why is white mortality going up in the U.S., but not in other countries?

DR. DEATON: One of the immediate things is opioids. European countries have much tighter controls on the way opioids are distributed. There has been none of this mass prescribing of opioids that has happened in the U.S. We have to get that genie back in the bottle. That’s very important, but it isn’t all of it. Of the three [types of] deaths we’ve looked at, suicides, opioids, and alcoholic liver disease, the biggest single one is opioids. But the other two together are bigger than opioids.

DR. CASE: I think opioids made it a perfect storm. But it was the case that people were killing themselves slowly with alcohol or quickly with guns even before the opioid crisis started. OxyContin wasn’t even on the market until 1996. We also want people to understand that this [is affecting] women, as well as men.

MS. ADAMY: What do you see in terms of geography? Where is this happening?

DR. CASE: In every state, deaths from suicide have increased between 1999 and 2015. In every state but two, alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis increases. In every state, drug overdoses.

MS. ADAMY: Interestingly, among blacks and Hispanics, mortality rates have fallen regardless of education level. Why is that?

DR. CASE: That was one of the first surprises to hit us. When we think about bad things, we usually think that the first population to be hit are African-Americans. But the death rates from alcohol and drugs fell through the ‘90s and the early 2000s until about 2010 for African-Americans, while they rose for whites.

So then, if you’re digging into what the underlying causes are, we are beginning to speculate about working-class whites possibly having the pillars that held up their lives beginning to crumble.

Lost generation

MS. ADAMY: And what were those pillars?

DR. CASE: Having a job with a ladder up, with on-the-job training, with benefits. Having a job where you could actually ask a woman to marry you and she would marry you. Now, marriage rates among working-class people are way down. She doesn’t want to marry him if he doesn’t have a good job.

Cohabitation is way up. But unlike in Europe, where those cohabitations are quite stable, in the U.S., they are fragile. Neither of them has a good job. They aren’t married, so they don’t have that stability. And they’ve moved away from what we call legacy churches, the Catholic and Protestant churches, toward evangelical churches, which focus on the individual. It’s my personal relationship with my savior, rather than it being about us as a community.

So those pillars of life—church, family, job—have disappeared for the white working class in a way that it hasn’t really been the case for blacks.

MS. ADAMY: You found that those in middle age now are likely to be worse off in old age than the current population. Can anything be done about that?

DR. DEATON: Several people have used the term lost generation for those people. It’s very unclear what to do with them. Their economic status will improve a little bit as they move into old age, simply because initial Social Security payments are indexed on average wages.

But we don’t think financial security is the essence of this matter. We think their lives will come apart in the way that Anne has been talking about. You’re a 55-year-old guy. You have never been married, but you’ve been in three consecutive relationships. You have three sets of kids, none of whom you know anymore because the younger ones are living with other guys. The community that you used to have has disintegrated.

Many people have mixed views about unions, but unions used to give people some measure of control at work. They gave them a social life and political representation in Washington, which doesn’t really exist anymore.

MS. ADAMY: Can employers do anything to help improve the fortunes of this working-class population?

DR. CASE: We don’t think the answer is getting everyone to go to college. That doesn’t seem realistic. The problem, we think, is that these people don’t have any standing in the labor market anymore.

The minimum wage hasn’t increased since, what, 1997? Noncompete clauses in labor contracts, even for working-class people, mean they can’t take a job for higher wages elsewhere. I think the lack of enforcement of antitrust laws means that some very large employers have [too much] power over the workforce. And so I think that one of the things that could happen is trying to rebuild the social contract between labor and capital. We are all at risk if we don’t do that.

"BEIJING—China accused Britain of violating its sovereignty after a British warship sailed close to disputed islands, in a fresh sign that U.S. allies are joining forces to challenge Beijing’s territorial claims in the South China Sea.

The Chinese navy identified the intruding ship as Britain’s HMS Albion and warned it to leave the area after it entered China’s territorial waters around the Paracel islands on Aug. 31 without permission, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement.

A spokesperson for Britain’s Royal Navy said: “HMS Albion exercised her rights for freedom of navigation in full compliance with international law and norms.” The Royal Navy declined to provide further details about where exactly the Albion sailed.

The operation, first reported by the Reuters news agency, is a rare instance of a British warship directly challenging China’s territorial claims since Beijing began building fortified artificial islands in the South China Sea four years ago.

The British sail-through also comes amid signs that other U.S. allies, including Japan, France and Australia, are setting aside fears of economic penalties from Beijing and responding to U.S. appeals to escalate their military activities in the South China Sea—one of the world’s busiest shipping routes—to prevent Beijing from cementing its grip.

Those countries have been alarmed by Beijing’s efforts to assert its expansive claims to the South China Sea, especially the construction of the seven artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan and the Philippines also claim the Spratlys in whole or partly.

China has also done extensive land reclamation and installed new weaponry in the Paracels. Those islands are claimed by Vietnam, China and Taiwan but have been controlled by Beijing since it ousted Vietnamese forces from the islands in 1974.

The Albion, an amphibious assault ship usually carrying about 350 sailors and marines, visited Japan before its operation around the Paracels and sailed afterward to Vietnam, where it arrived Monday. It’s one of the three ships the Royal Navy is deploying to the Asia Pacific this year, after an absence of almost five years.

The Chinese foreign ministry statement said that the Albion had violated Chinese and international laws, that Beijing had made “solemn representations” to the British government and that China will take “all necessary measures to defend national sovereignty and security.”

China’s Defense Ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment.

While territorial waters generally extend 12 nautical miles from shore under international law, China’s claims around the Paracels extend beyond that limit in several places. Beijing also demands that foreign naval ships seek prior permission before entering its territorial waters, although international law allows them to transit on the basis of “innocent passage.”

The U.S. regularly conducts similar “freedom of navigation” operations around the Spratlys and Paracels to challenge what it sees as excessive maritime claims and to exercise its right to operate in international waters.

Until recently, Washington had tried to get allies to do the same. Although they sometimes sent navy ships through other less contested parts of the South China Sea, only in recent months have some shown a willingness to challenge Beijing more directly.

In June at a security conference in Singapore, the British and French defense ministers said in separate remarks that their navies would exercise their right to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.

French Defense Minister Florence Parly said that British ships and helicopters would join a French maritime task group in Singapore to conduct one such operation. She didn’t specify where the ships would go but said they would sail to “those areas where at some point a stern voice intrudes into the transponder and tells us to sail away from supposedly territorial waters.”

Jonas Parello-Plesner, a fellow at the Washington-based Hudson Institute, wrote in a commentary for The Wall Street Journal a few days later that he had been on board a French warship, carrying a British helicopter detachment, that passed through the Spratlys. He said that another French naval ship, but no British ones, took part in that freedom-of-navigation operation, and neither French ship passed within 12 nautical miles of China’s man-made islands.

"A Turkish court sentenced Wall Street Journal reporter Ayla Albayrak to two years and one month in prison Tuesday, declaring her guilty of engaging in terrorist propaganda in support of a banned Kurdish separatist organization through one of her Journal articles.

The conviction of Ms. Albayrak, who is currently in New York, highlights the increasing targeting of journalists in Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government has gained attention for deteriorating media freedoms.

“This was an unfounded criminal charge and wildly inappropriate conviction that wrongly singled out a balanced Wall Street Journal report,” said Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Gerard Baker. “The sole purpose of the article was to provide objective and independent reporting on events in Turkey, and it succeeded.”

Ms. Albayrak plans to appeal the decision. “Given the current climate in Turkey, this appalling decision shouldn’t have come as a surprise to me, but it did,” she said.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said it condemned the Turkish court decision.

“The conviction of Ayla in Turkey is a very worrying sign and an escalation of the crackdown on the press,” said Nina Ognianova, the CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, calling Turkey the world’s top jailer of journalists. “We call on the Turkish authorities to overturn this decision immediately,” she said.

Turkish legal actions against Ms. Albayrak began after the publication on Aug. 19, 2015, on the Journal’s website of her article “Urban Warfare Escalates in Turkey’s Kurdish-Majority Southeast.” The article and accompanying video reported on the state of a conflict in Silopi, Turkey, between Turkish security forces and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. It included interviews with the local mayor and residents, a Turkish government official, as well as a representative of an organization Turkey says is the youth unit of the PKK.

Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union consider the PKK a terrorist organization.

In November of the same year, Ms. Albayrak, who has dual Finnish and Turkish citizenship, received a written order on her door to visit her local police station in Istanbul where she was notified she was under investigation for spreading terrorist propaganda.

At the police station, she gave a statement saying the article accurately reflected the state of the conflict between the PKK and the Turkish government. In April 2016, a prosecutor in southeastern Turkey filed an indictment against Ms. Albayrak alleging that she violated antiterror laws.

Ms. Albayrak testified from the Istanbul court house to the Cizre court via video-link in January 2017.

William Lewis, Dow Jones’s chief executive officer and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, said: “This ruling against a professional and respected journalist is an affront to all who are committed to furthering a free and robust press. We call on those who share this commitment to make their voices heard.

“The notion that our reporter’s commendable and insightful work led to a criminal prosecution that has resulted in this wrongful conviction is intolerable,” Mr. Lewis said. “We have stood by Ms. Albayrak’s side for nearly two years as we have robustly pursued all available options to defend this baseless prosecution, and we will continue to stand with her as we seek to overturn this conviction.”

As part of the article she was convicted for, Ms. Albayrak interviewed a person who described herself as a member of the Patriotic Revolutionary Youth Movement, or YDG-H, which the Turkish government says is the youth unit of the PKK.

Ms. Albayrak said in a statement included in the court documents that the original article didn’t include any praise for the group, but rather provided a balanced and objective view of urban warfare that had gripped areas of Turkey’s predominantly Kurdish southeast at the time.

“The decision shows the extent to which the authorities did not want the operations that were going on in Turkey’s southeast to be reported on,” said Ms. Albayrak. “It also shows yet again, that the international media is not immune to the ongoing press crackdown in Turkey.”

The court decision comes amid an escalating diplomatic spat between Washington and Ankara that has seen the U.S. suspend nearly all types of visa services for Turks. The row erupted after a U.S. consulate employee was arrested on suspicion of having ties to U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for last year’s failed coup. Turkey in response said it was suspending U.S. visa applications. Mr. Gulen denies the accusation.

Court documents filed against Ms. Albayrak say the Journal article and accompanying video, which included images of men and women bearing PKK emblems, provided fodder for 24 Turkish-language websites that translated parts of the article. Turkish officials sent a list of the websites’ articles in late August to the country’s Telecommunication Directorate to have them blocked.

Ms. Albayrak and the Journal have said they have no relationship with any of the Turkish-language websites that published only parts of her article. The Journal said excerpts published by the websites were distorted.

Ms. Albayrak said she was charged around the same time that the Turkish government had begun a crackdown on Kurdish-majority cities in the country’s southeast, where many members of the ethnic minority live.

Mr. Baker said Ms. Albayrak embodies The Wall Street Journal tradition, “spending years as an intrepid journalist producing insightful, fair and impartial coverage from Turkey. We will work tirelessly to overturn this preposterous conviction.”

The case is a rare instance of terrorism charges brought against a reporter working for a Western media outlet. Deniz Yücel, a prominent German-Turkish journalist for newspaper Die Welt, was arrested in Istanbul in February under terrorism suspicions and remains in pretrial detention without official charges despite repeated protests from the German government. Mr. Yücel has denied any wrongdoing.

In the wake of last year’s failed coup against Mr. Erdogan’s government, authorities have increased focus on journalists they suspect harbor sympathies for Mr. Gulen, as well as those who report on Kurdish separatism.

Mesale Tolu, a Turkish-German citizen who worked as a translator for the leftist-leaning Etkin Haber Ajansi, was detained earlier this year on suspicion of spreading terrorist propaganda and belonging to a leftist organization considered a terrorist group in Turkey, CPJ said. She is scheduled to go on trial on Wednesday.

Amnesty International and other rights groups say Turkey has more journalists jailed than any other country in the world. Authorities have closed more than 150 media outlets under the state of emergency’s executive orders, according to Human Rights Watch and Freedom House.

Turkey ranked 155 on Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index this year, worse than Russia or Pakistan. The index is based on statistics of violence against journalists, along with evaluations of pluralism, media independence, self-censorship and legislation.

“Media freedom and pluralism has largely been crushed,” said Johann Bihr, who analyzes Turkey for Reporters Without Borders.

Under the state of emergency in place since the coup, authorities have applied antiterrorism laws in some cases to restrict access to legal counsel and increase the duration of pretrial detention.

The government “aggressively used the penal code, criminal defamation legislation and the country’s anti-terrorism law to punish critical reporting, and journalists faced growing violence,” said democracy advocacy group Freedom House last year.

The PKK picked up arms in 1984 to fight for an independent Kurdish homeland within Turkey’s borders.

Since the PKK’s first insurrection, the group has been responsible for numerous bombings of civilian and military targets in Ankara, Istanbul and numerous cities throughout the southeast.

In Griswold, Judge Kavanaugh specifically aligned himself with a concurring opinion by Justice Byron White that found the Connecticut law violated the liberty protected by the 14th Amendment’s due-process clause.

"On Friday, Father Raúl Enríquez celebrated Mass at the Church of Divine Mercy in Managua for the first time since police and allied paramilitary forces attacked the church to drive out protesters who had sought sanctuary there.

MONIMBÓ, Nicaragua—The Rev. César Augusto Gutiérrez delivered an impassioned plea to a Spanish radio station last week as hundreds of elite police and paramilitary forces stormed his parish here in a hail of bullets.

“They are defiling the churches,” Father Gutierrez said before breaking down in tears as he pleaded for international support. “The government is killing us.”

He described in a halting voice how neighborhood youths in Monimbó, the heart of what has become a national movement of resistance to President Daniel Ortega, confronted the onslaught with stones and homemade rockets from behind street barricades.

“They can’t keep governing over a pile of the dead,” he said.

Scenes on Friday at the Church of Divine Mercy in Managua on Friday. Nicaragua’s bishops have scheduled a month of prayer and atonement, with special Friday masses to exorcise the evils that plague the country. The image of Christ, below, is now marked by three bullet holes from a raid by paramilitary forces on July 13.

For more than three months, Mr. Ortega has set loose his forces on Nicaraguans who have rebelled against his government, after what started as local protests against a tax increase turned into a national movement. More than 300 people have been killed, most of them opponents of Mr. Ortega, human-rights groups say.

The Catholic Church, the oldest and most prestigious institution in Nicaragua, has been on the front lines. Clergy have been assaulted and at least 10 churches have been attacked, shot at, looted or defiled during the last three months, mostly by government-allied paramilitary groups, clerics said.

After protests broke out in April, the church—at Mr. Ortega’s request—agreed to mediate a national dialogue to try to resolve Nicaragua’s crisis.

On Thursday, the president shifted course, railing against the church before tens of thousands of supporters in a speech marking the 39th anniversary of the triumph of his Sandinista revolution over dictator Anastasio Somoza.

Jabbing his hands into the air, Mr. Ortega said the bishops were allied with opponents seeking a violent coup.

“Many churches were used as barracks to store ammunition and bombs and to use as bases to attack and assassinate,” he said, as the crowd chanted support. “The opposition is in league with Satan, and the bishops should exorcise them.”

Paramilitary groups in Monimbó, Nicaragua, after government security forces and their allies moved in against protesters last week.

Clerics saw the speech as a signal from Mr. Ortega that he was broadening his crackdown. All of Nicaragua’s bishops have been threatened since the speech, said Bishop Rolando Álvarez of Matagalpa, in the north of the country.

“We have many priests who have taken refuge,” he said. “I dare say that all priests, or practically all, fear for their lives.”

The day after the speech, the government abandoned a church-brokered deal to help rescue some 200 youths who had escaped Mr. Ortega’s police and paramilitary forces. The students had fled into the countryside after the government retook Monimbó.

“He doesn’t like our position of defending victims and denouncing violent acts and assassinations,” said Bishop Carlos Herrera of Jinotega, in northern Nicaragua.

Mr. Ortega and the Sandinista movement have been at odds with the Catholic Church for much of their long, intertwined history. Although a few priests influenced by leftist “liberation theology” played key roles during his first years in office, Mr. Ortega clashed with the Nicaraguan hierarchy and with Pope John Paul II. The late pope, in a famous incident, wagged his finger at a priest in the Sandinista government on the tarmac of the Managua airport during his 1983 visit.

Monimbó was the heart of an uprising against Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega; paramilitary forces patrolled the town last week.

In 2014, the Nicaraguan Bishop’s Conference called for democratization as Mr. Ortega, who has been president since 2007 and previously held the office from 1985-90, took control of congress, courts and electoral authorities. The president has since abolished term limits and used state institutions to destroy any serious political opposition.

The recent protests, which took the nation by surprise, began in April after Mr. Ortega raised taxes to rescue an insolvent social security system. College students leading demonstrations against the increase in the capital, Managua, were confronted by Mr. Ortega’s police forces and their allies.

Dozens of protesters were killed in a military response that unleashed a national backlash in places including Monimbó, part of the city of Masaya. For a time, protesters took over entire cities and blocked the nation’s main roads.

In recent days, Mr. Ortega has retaken much of the territory that he lost in the first weeks of protests. His loyalists knocked down most barricades with overwhelming firepower. He has passed a law that will allow terrorism charges against protesters and those who financially support protests.

The government violence has been widely condemned, and the U.S. has sanctioned top Nicaraguan officials close to the president. But Mr. Ortega has been defiant, asserting the government would strengthen its “self-defense mechanisms.”

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, center in cap, waves to supporters celebrating the 39th anniversary of the victory of his Sandinista revolution. Mr. Ortega used the speech to denounce opposition forces calling for his ouster.

Attacks against the Church increased in ferocity this month. On July 13, paramilitaries wearing ski masks shot up the parish house and Church of Divine Mercy in Managua. There were more than 100 protesters inside, many of them students from a nearby university who had sought refuge. Two people were killed and 10 wounded during the 15-hour siege.

“We were all on the floor, the lights were out, we were all terrified,” said the Rev. Erick Alvarado, who lived through the attack. In the sacristy, three bullets perforated a life-size painting of Christ.

Two days later, Bishop Abelardo Mata of the northern diocese of Estelí was attacked by a mob of government supporters as police looked on at a road checkpoint. The mob shot six homemade explosives at his car, breaking the windshield and puncturing its tires. Msgr. Mata managed to take refuge in a house, and was later taken to safety under police escort after an intervention by diplomats.

ABOVE: Azucena López (center) weeps over the death of her son Erick Jiménez, who was killed when pro-Ortega groups attacked protesters in Monimbó. BELOW: Family and friends during the funeral procession on Wednesday.

“They were shooting to kill,” said a witness.

The bishop continues to get death threats, which escalated after Mr. Ortega’s speech on Thursday, the witness added: “They say they are going to give him lead, lead, and more lead.”

The previous week, mobs attacked the country’s cardinal, other leading prelates and the Vatican’s diplomatic envoy when the clergymen tried to rescue people who had taken refuge in a church in the town of Diriamba.

In that melee, Bishop Silvio Báez, auxiliary bishop of Managua, was punched in the stomach as an assailant tried to steal his pectoral cross. He suffered a deep gash on his arm as he defended himself.

“It was a very difficult moment,” he said. “They shouted ‘assassins, criminals!”

Mr. Ortega began his career as a communist guerrilla chief. He served as president from 1985 to 1990 as his Sandinista government battled U.S.-backed guerrillas known as “Contras” in a civil war that cost thousands of lives. During his years out of office, he used his control of Sandinista unions to mobilize violent protests.

During his second incarnation as president, Mr. Ortega discarded his previous policies of nationalizing private businesses. Instead, he made a pact with Nicaragua’s private sector which helped to deliver solid economic growth. Under his rule, Nicaragua also avoided the scourge of gang violence which has given its Central American neighbors some of the highest homicide rates in the world.

Although the Catholic Church in Nicaragua, as in all Latin America, has lost faithful to evangelical churches, it has remained a respected institution in Nicaragua because it has been close to the country’s poor and, under Mr. Ortega, outspoken in the defense of justice.

Mr. Ortega’s political career got a boost before the presidential race of 2006 when he made amends with Nicaragua’s then cardinal, the late Miguel Obando y Bravo, who had been a ferocious critic of Mr. Ortega and the Sandinistas during much of the 1980s. Now, with Thursday’s speech, relations are again at a low.

On Friday, the Church of Divine Mercy, which withstood attack by paramilitaries, was overflowing with worshipers, most of them middle-class Nicaraguans. A priest read from the exorcism prayer of St. Michael the Archangel, who in Catholic teaching led legions of angels to do battle against Lucifer and his hosts, vanquishing them into the abyss.

In the overflow crowd outside the church, Félix Benavides, a driver, said he was there to show his solidarity with the church and the bishops. “We are here to back the bishops,” he said. “We think worse days are coming to Nicaragua.”

"It turns out that Russia has sown distrust in the U.S. political system—aided and abetted by the Democratic Party, and perhaps the FBI. This is an about-face from the dominant media narrative of the last year, and it requires a full investigation.

The Washington Post revealed Tuesday that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee jointly paid for that infamous “dossier” full of Russian disinformation against Donald Trump. They filtered the payments through a U.S. law firm (Perkins Coie), which hired the opposition-research hit men at Fusion GPS. Fusion in turn tapped a former British spook, Christopher Steele, to compile the allegations, which are based largely on anonymous, Kremlin-connected sources.

Strip out the middlemen, and it appears that Democrats paid for Russians to compile wild allegations about a U.S. presidential candidate. Did someone say “collusion”?

This news is all the more explosive because the DNC and Clinton campaign hid their role, even amid the media furor after BuzzFeed published the Steele dossier in January. Reporters are now saying that Clinton campaign officials lied to them about their role in the dossier. Current DNC Chair Tom Perez and former Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz deny knowing about the dossier arrangement, but someone must have known.

Perhaps this explains why Congressional Democrats have been keen to protect Fusion from answering dossier questions—disrupting hearings, protesting subpoenas and deriding Republican investigators. Two of Fusion’s cofounders invoked their Fifth Amendment rights last week rather than answer House Intelligence Committee questions, and Fusion filed a federal lawsuit on Friday to block committee subpoenas of its bank records.

The more troubling question is whether the FBI played a role, even if inadvertently, in assisting a Russian disinformation campaign. We know the agency possessed the dossier in 2016, and according to media reports it debated paying Mr. Steele to continue his work in the runup to the election. This occurred while former FBI Director James Comey was ramping up his probe into supposed ties between the Trump campaign and Russians.

Two pertinent questions: Did the dossier trigger the FBI probe of the Trump campaign, and did Mr. Comey or his agents use it as evidence to seek wiretapping approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Trump campaign aides?

Congressional investigators need to focus on the FBI’s role, and House Speaker Paul Ryan was correct Wednesday to insist that the bureau comply with Congress’s document demands “immediately.” Mr. Sessions has recused himself from the Justice Department’s Russia probe, but he and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein can still insist on transparency. Mr. Ryan should also reinstall Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes as lead on the Russia investigation, since it appears the Democratic accusations against him were aimed in part at throwing him off the Fusion trail.

All of this also raises questions about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The Fusion news means the FBI’s role in Russia’s election interference must now be investigated—even as the FBI and Justice insist that Mr. Mueller’s probe prevents them from cooperating with Congressional investigators.

Mr. Mueller is a former FBI director, and for years he worked closely with Mr. Comey. It is no slur against Mr. Mueller’s integrity to say that he lacks the critical distance to conduct a credible probe of the bureau he ran for a dozen years. He could best serve the country by resigning to prevent further political turmoil over that conflict of interest.

"National rivalries are a spicy ingredient at any Olympics—and that’s especially true when it comes to Korea and Japan, two countries whose historical strife is a hot theme at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.

Tensions between the divided Korean peninsula and its island neighbor have featured in numerous ways at these Olympics, from the Opening Ceremony to a recent women’s hockey match between Japan and the joint inter-Korean team.

This rivalry is set to take center stage again on Sunday when two-time Olympic gold medalist Lee Sang-hwa, 27, of South Korea, aims for a third gold in the women’s 500 meters long-track speedskating. Lee’s biggest rival is Japan’s Nao Kodaira, 30, who had a strong comeback last year when she took first place in the 500 meters competition at the Asian Winter Games, the World Cup and the World Single Distances Championships.

Lee and Kodaira’s match will be one of the most closely-watched races by locals at the 2018 Winter Olympics and—as with any match between South Korea and Japan—the stakes are high.

Newsletter Sign-up

Lee set the world record in 500 meters at 36.36 seconds in 2013, which still remains unmatched. She landed gold in the same distance race in the 2010 and 2014 Olympics. But Lee’s ranking slipped behind her Japanese rival last year as she recovered from injuries.

Despite her superb performance at the world championships, Kodaira has had less luck at the Olympics. At her past two Olympics in Vancouver and Sochi, the Japanese skater came in 12th and 5th, never making it to the podium. But she has started strong in Pyeongchang, taking silver-—her first-ever Olympic medal—on Wednesday at the 1,000 meters race. Lee decided to skip that race to focus on her main 500 meters competition.

If Lee wins gold, she would be the second woman to win three consecutive golds in 500 meters since American skater Bonnie Blair, who came in first in 1988, 1992 and 1994.

Sunday’s competition comes against a backdrop of controversy between the two countries at the Pyeongchang Games.

At the opening ceremony, NBC came under fire when a commentator, Joshua Cooper Ramo, remarked on how Koreans universally looked up to Japan as a “cultural and technical and economic example.” Ramo’s comment outraged Koreans who criticized him for glossing over Japan’s brutal 35-year-long colonial occupation of Korea.

Shortly after Ramo’s comment, NBC’s Twitter and Instagram accounts were flooded with criticisms from Koreans.

Ramo posted an apology on his Twitter account Wednesday, saying that he “did not intend to minimize or disrespect a part of Korean history that must never be forgotten.”

While Japanese colonial rule ended in 1945, its legacy remains a delicate issue in South Korean society. Every Wednesday, protesters gather in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul to demand a formal apology from Tokyo for forcing Korean women to provide sexual services to Japanese soldiers during World War II. When Japanese prime ministers visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine—a memorial to Japan’s 2.5 million war dead that also enshrines some convicted war criminals—it generates anger and headlines in South Korea.

Japan also decried the use of a unified flag of the Korean peninsula during the Opening Ceremony last week that included a small dot representing a disputed islet claimed by both Korea and Japan. The islet, known as Dokdo in Korean and as Takeshima in Japanese, is controlled by South Korea, but claimed by Japan.

Japan successfully lobbied for the two Koreas to use a unified flag that omitted the small dot. A spokesman for South Korea’s foreign ministry said Korea would remove the dot out of respect for the International Olympic Committee’s efforts to avoid political disputes during the Games.

Lee and Kodaira say they are just focusing on their competition. At a recent interview with South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency, Lee asked reporters not to draw comparisons between her and Kodaira, adding that the result would simply “depend on how well (she) handles pressure.” Kodaira told the same outlet that she wanted to have “a good match” with Lee.

"BRUSSELS—As if the European Union didn’t have enough to worry about, now it’s at odds over what should be its dominant language.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, wants to make French grand again and replace English as the default language in EU institutions, the way it was before Britain joined the bloc in 1973. With the U.K. negotiating to leave the EU next spring, he is eager to restore the linguistic ancien regime.

“English has probably never been so present in Brussels as when we’re talking about Brexit,” Mr. Macron said in March on the Day of Francophonie—a celebration of French language and culture observed in more than 70 countries. “This domination is not inevitable,” he declared.

Dethroning the Queen’s English looks nearly impossible for the soon-to-be 27-country bloc. Its 24 official languages produce 552 translating combinations—an impractically large number that demands a shortcut.

English is by far the leading foreign language taught in the EU, according to official statistics. Over 80% of primary-school children and over 95% of secondary-school students across the bloc learn English before any other foreign language.

Still, Brexit means a downgrading for English. Today it’s the official language for 12.8% of the EU’s 511 million people but after Britain leaves it will be just the second official language in just two countries: Ireland and Malta. Combined they represent 1.2% of the EU’s post-Brexit population.

Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, known for her pithy tweets during EU leaders’ meetings, said any decision regarding the bloc’s linguistic regime “cannot be divorced from reality.”

“English is the most popular language of communication in the EU and people will continue to use it. Especially given that it is one of the official languages in Ireland and Malta,” Ms. Grybauskaite said.

A more modest, but perhaps not less daunting, challenge is improving the EU’s English. The bloc’s main translating body says 81% of EU documents are drafted in English, 5% in French, 2% in German and the rest in the 21 other languages. Yet only 2.8% of EU staff are British.

That imbalance prompted Jeremy Gardner, an English translator from Windsor, to write a handbook of words and phrases frequently misused in the EU. Mr. Gardner, who spent most of his professional life in Italy and Luxembourg, published the last edition two years ago—just one month before Britain voted to go it alone.

Some quirks of EU English his lexicon attempts to correct: An EU document too frequently doesn’t “say” something—it “foresees” it. Many staff are known as “contractual agents.” Instead of cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys, EU documents speak of “bovine, ovine, caprine and asinine animals.”

The word “axis” is used to denote programs that have a high priority within the EU’s bureaucracy. The European Commission—the bloc’s civil service—has, among others, a fisheries axis, a social policy axis and a technology transfer axis.

Much of the odd phrasing is the result of half-translations from French. Officials go “on mission” rather than taking business trips. They draft “fiches,” not documents, and talk about “enterprises” rather than companies.

The EU uses the term “comitology” to denote a decision-making process among national experts from the 28 countries. The jargon is likely taken from a French word that means a committee procedure. The word “comitology” was also used in 1957 by Cyril Northcote Parkinson, a British writer, to refer to the study of how committees and government cabinets are created and eventually grow irrelevant.

For centuries, French was the language of European affairs and international diplomacy. When Mr. Gardner joined in 1991, his orientation courses in Luxembourg were offered mostly in French.

Vestiges of French pre-eminence linger at the U.S. State Department, which still sends démarches to foreign governments, rather than just letters, and issues communiqués, not simply statements. U.S. ambassadors have a No. 2 called a chargé d’affaires.

U.S. ascendancies in the last century helped English eclipse French. Victory in the Cold War sealed English’s lock on Europe because almost everyone in ex-communist countries between Germany and Russia picked English as their preferred second language.

Now Mr. Macron is making a stand. His recently appointed ambassador to the EU, Philippe Léglise-Costa, walked out of a budget meeting in April because English was the only working language.

“Everyone was happy to speak in English, but once he made a fuss, the others also started demanding interpretation into their national languages,” said a Nordic diplomat in the room. “They got their French interpretation for the next meeting, but I’m sure eventually everyone will start talking English again,” the diplomat said.

Mr. Macron said he wants to “set some rules, to be present, and make French the language with which one has access to a number of opportunities.” He pledged to offer more French classes to EU officials and to beef up its international network of French-speaking schools.

One Macron ally in the battle to restore French is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a native from neighboring Luxembourg, who frequently delivers public remarks in French and German.

“Why would Shakespeare’s language be superior to that of Voltaire?” Mr. Juncker said on French TV recently. “We are wrong to have become so anglicized,” he said, in French.

Mr. Gardner recently retired from the EU’s Court of Auditors, which isn’t actually a court. (Its name comes from, you guessed it, French.) While scoffing at the notion of Brexit restoring French as the bloc’s pre-eminent tongue, he predicts it could open the door to something more revolutionary: American English.

"Under White House pressure, the Senate Republican leadership is moving to expedite the final stages of Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court after Thursday’s planned hearing featuring the woman who has accused him of sexual assault when they were teenagers.

The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote Friday on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office alerted senators they should be prepared to work over the weekend, suggesting the chamber could take a procedural vote that would clear the way for a final, full-Senate vote early next week.

President Trump wants Judge Kavanaugh to take the seat of retired Justice Anthony Kennedy by Oct. 1, the start of the high court’s next term. Republican lawmakers are also pressing to fill the lifetime appointment before the November midterm elections in which they are fighting to maintain their majorities in the House and Senate.

“I think that it’s going to be pretty hard to move this along without having votes on certainly Friday or Saturday, probably,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah).

Christine Blasey Ford, the California college professor who has accused the judge of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school during the 1980s, is set to appear Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge Kavanaugh, who has denied Dr. Ford’s claims, is also scheduled to appear Thursday before the committee.

Democrats are objecting to Republicans pushing forward on the nomination and vote without first having the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigate Dr. Ford’s allegations.

“Republicans are already talking about rushing to a vote—before we even got to this hearing, before there is an investigation, and while women are sharing more stories,” Sen. Patty Murray (D., Wash.) said on Twitter. “It’s disgusting, it’s disgraceful—and women across the country are paying attention.”

Committee rules require Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) to issue a public notice of a meeting three days in advance. He also has the right to postpone it, which the committee did earlier this week as negotiations for Thursday’s hearing showed progress.

Mr. Trump is frustrated by the delay in the vote, a White House official said Tuesday. The president spoke with the Senate majority leader over the weekend, with Mr. McConnell explaining to Mr. Trump that he had to accommodate certain senators who wanted to ensure that Dr. Ford gets a hearing, the official said. Paraphrasing Mr. McConnell’s message, the official said: “You can’t wave a magic wand and get 51 votes in the Senate overnight.”

It wasn’t clear if Republicans have the 50 votes needed to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. At least three GOP senators are waiting to declare how they will vote until after Thursday’s hearing. Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate. To prevail, they can afford no more than one defection, assuming all Democratic caucus members oppose the nomination. If they lose one vote, they could then have Vice President Mike Pence break a tie.

“I am not going to speculate on where I am. Our meetings certainly went well. He certainly has the credentials,” Sen. Susan Collins (R.,Maine) said Tuesday. “But we now have a serious allegation made and I look forward to the hearing on Thursday.”

Earlier Tuesday, the White House said it was open to congressional testimony from a second woman, who has accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual aggression when he was a college student. There was no indication Senate Republicans would go along with that as a Thursday hearing set to include Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh approached.

“We would be open to that, and that process could take place on Thursday,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” when asked whether the president wanted to hear from Deborah Ramirez, a Yale University classmate of the nominee.

Ms. Ramirez’s attorney, John Clune, told CNN on Tuesday that he was in contact with the Judiciary Committee but that Republicans declined to participate in a call until Ms. Ramirez sent more information and that his client wants the FBI to investigate the allegations first before providing more details to lawmakers.

Her allegations couldn’t be independently verified by The Wall Street Journal. Judge Kavanaugh, who spoke to Senate committee aides about the Ramirez accusation on Tuesday, has denied her claims.

Judiciary Committee Republicans hired Rachel Mitchell, a Phoenix-based sex crimes prosecutor to question Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh on Thursday, a GOP aide said. Republicans were anxious to avoid the optics of 11 men questioning a woman about her sexual assault.

In a Fox News interview Monday, Judge Kavanaugh repeated his denials of Dr. Ford’s claims and said, “I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone. I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter.”

Steve Kantrowitz, a Yale classmate who is now a history professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, questioned that assertion. He wrote on Twitter Tuesday morning, “Perhaps Brett Kavanaugh was a virgin for many years after high school. But he claimed otherwise in a conversation with me during our freshman year in Lawrance Hall at Yale, in the living room of my suite.”

Mr. Kantrowitz said via email Tuesday that he posted the tweet because of the importance of “honest and integrity” in serving as a justice, and he remembered the conversation because it was surprising. Kerri Kupec, a White House spokeswoman, said Judge Kavanaugh spoke “honestly and forthrightly” in the Fox interview.

The television interview was a highly unusual event for a Supreme Court nominee or any high-level appointment as most administrations guard against a high-profile mistake that could derail a confirmation vote.

White House officials concluded that Judge Kavanaugh needed to rebut the allegations of sexual assault and present himself as an honorable person to the public, which has shown waning support for him in polls.

A WSJ/NBC poll released last week found that 38% of registered voters oppose the Kavanaugh nomination, up from 29% in a Journal/NBC poll last month. Some 34% said they support his nomination, which is about the same as in last month’s poll. More than a quarter of voters say they don’t know enough to have an opinion.

“The press has been carrying Democrats’ and Dr. Ford’s narrative,” a White House official said Tuesday. “They haven’t carried forward the clarity of the judge’s denials. We thought having him on TV and presenting that to the country was important. That was the goal and that was what he accomplished.”

After viewing the interview, people close to Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination are recommending he show more feistiness in the hearing on Thursday and they’ve made that point to him.

In the Fox News interview, Judge Kavanaugh relied heavily on prepared talking points, notably, that he wanted “a fair process.” He repeated the phrase nearly 20 times, according to a transcript.

White House officials are preparing to hold more prep sessions for Judge Kavanaugh ahead of the hearing Thursday, but plan to keep them shorter and tighter in the hope that he won’t be “over-prepared” for his encounter with the Judiciary Committee, one official said Tuesday.

"President Trump accused China of trying to interfere in the midterm U.S. elections, opening up an unexpected front in his administration’s multi-sided conflict with a chief global adversary.

Mr. Trump said Beijing was trying to damage him politically and hurt the Republican Party over growing trade disputes, in part by using newspaper ads to target voters in areas most affected by retaliatory Chinese tariffs.

The accusation on Wednesday added to an expanding list of grievances between the two global economic powers, spanning trade, territorial claims in the South China Sea, military cooperation and espionage.

The rising number of issues where tensions have emerged threatens to turn what had been a rivalry into open confrontation between Washington and Beijing.

After Mr. Trump initially made friendly personal overtures to Chinese President Xi Jinping, the U.S. leader on Wednesday said he thought the two men were possibly no longer friends because of the trade dispute. Mr. Trump said he would call Mr. Xi to discuss the trade matter on Thursday.

During a press conference Wednesday, President Trump took questions from reporters on a range of topics including Nafta, China, Brett Kavanaugh and Rod Rosenstein. These are the highlights. Photo: Associated Press

In the latest sign of discord, Mr. Trump charged that the Chinese had mounted a campaign to meddle in the midterm elections in November. He didn’t present evidence showing China was seeking to influence U.S. politics to the level of Russia’s covert campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

“Regrettably, we’ve found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election coming up in November against my administration,” Mr. Trump said in his opening remarks while chairing the United Nations Security Council as other countries sought to focus on issues related to nuclear nonproliferation.

“They do not want me—or us—to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade.”

On Twitter later in the day, Mr. Trump accused China of “placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers, made to look like news.”

“That’s because we are beating them on Trade, opening markets, and the farmers will make a fortune when this is over!” he wrote.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who attended the Security Council meeting, denied any intervention by China in elections in the U.S. or elsewhere.

“China has all along followed the policy of noninterference in other countries’ affairs,” Mr. Wang said. “We did not and will not interfere in any other countries’ affairs. We refuse to accept any unwarranted accusations against China.”

Chinese state media bought a four-page advertising insert in the Des Moines Register in Iowa this week. The advertisement said Chinese President Xi Jinping studied in the state on a college exchange and said Beijing could “be an example for the world.”

Such foreign media advertising in U.S. newspapers are relatively common, for other countries as well as China.

A senior administration official said during a press call that China’s behavior had “reached an unacceptable level” that went “well beyond how most other countries interact with each other.” The official added China’s practices included “cyber” activities but the official didn’t elaborate.

Vice President Mike Pence will deliver a speech next week laying out more specific detail about China’s malign influence activities, the official said.

Mr. Trump’s accusation of election meddling followed increased tit-for-tat disputes with Beijing over trade and military affairs.

The U.S. has alleged that China forces U.S. firms to transfer technology to their Chinese partners. On Monday, the U.S. levied 10% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, bringing the total Chinese imports hit by U.S. levies to $250 billion, or about half of Chinese imports to the U.S.

China has matched the U.S. actions with its own tariffs on $110 billion on U.S. imports into China, which is about 85% of what the U.S. exports to Beijing. Much of those Chinese tariffs hit U.S. agricultural goods, like soybeans and pork, produced in counties that voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump in the 2016 election.

Mr. Trump and his advisers point to the Chinese tariffs as evidence that Beijing is targeting the Republican base in an effort to affect the midterm elections. Last week Mr. Trump tweeted that “China has openly stated that they are actively trying to affect and change our election by attacking our farmers, ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me.”

But given the scale of the Chinese tariffs, it was inevitable they would hit a big export item like agriculture. Also Beijing is far from the only country to look to sway Congress through tariffs when it is in a trade battle with the U.S.

Adding to tensions, the Chinese government this week denied a U.S. Navy ship permission for a port visit to Hong Kong next month, retaliating for sanctions slapped on a Chinese military agency that had purchased Russian combat aircraft and a surface-to-air missile system.

Additionally, a growing number of Chinese espionage cases—involving Chinese nationals or former U.S. officials recruited by Beijing’s intelligence services—have been brought to public trial in recent months, as the Justice Department has sought to deter the theft of intellectual property or national security secrets.

On Tuesday, prosecutors said they had arrested a 27-year-old Chinese national who attended college in the United States and enlisted in the Army for allegedly spying on U.S. engineers.

Also in recent weeks, the Justice Department ordered Xinhua News Agency and China Global Television Network, two leading Chinese state-run media organizations, to register as foreign agents.

Still, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Mr. Xi, repeating in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that it had been “a pleasure and an honor” to work with the Chinese leader.

And Mr. Trump spurned the advice of national security officials and Republicans and Democrats in Congress this summer when he granted China’s ZTE Corp. a reprieve from a ban that would have banned U.S. companies from selling components to the telecommunications giant.

Mr. Trump didn’t mention Russian interference during his U.N. remarks on Wednesday, before the Security Council. Top U.S. intelligence officials have warned publicly in recent weeks that Russia is engaging in a “pervasive” effort to interfere in the midterm elections.

U.S. lawmakers from both parties have criticized Mr. Trump for underplaying the threat posed by Moscow and for embracing the denials of Russian President Vladimir Putin about 2016 election interference over the unanimous assessment of the U.S. intelligence community, which concluded the Kremlin orchestrated a multipronged cyber operation to boost Mr. Trump’s candidacy.

U.S. intelligence officials have repeatedly raised the possibility that others besides Russia could attempt to interfere in American elections.

There is “of course” concern about the possibility that Beijing or others would try to influence U.S. elections, one U.S. official said, who declined to discuss specific intelligence reports.

Chinese hackers breached the campaigns of both Barack Obama and John McCain during the 2008 election, according to U.S. officials. But Beijing and others haven’t previously engaged in a sophisticated operation to the scale of Russia’s 2016 meddling attempting to achieve a specific outcome of an election, officials have said.

Most of the focus around securing the midterms elections has so far been on deterring Russia from launching another sophisticated influence operation, but other adversaries have come under scrutiny for their online influence operations in recent months as well.

Technology companies including Facebook and YouTube disclosed Iran-linked misinformation campaigns on their platforms last month.

Despite the attention Russia’s election interference and efforts to sow political discord in the U.S. have received, China remains a top long-term strategic threat, top U.S. intelligence officials have said.

“China often executes its strategy in a more deliberate and subtle manner” than Russia, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats said Tuesday at an intelligence conference in South Carolina.

Seated alongside Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday, Mr. Trump repeated his assertion that China is “trying to meddle in our elections,” without offering details, adding, “we’re not going to let that happen, just as we’re not going to let that happen with Russia.”

"BAGHDAD—Rival political groups backed by the U.S. and Iran vied to form Iraq’s next government Monday as the country’s parliament convened for the first time since an election four months ago produced no clear winner.

The challenge to form a new government was evident as lawmakers failed to elect a speaker as mandated, portending weeks of horse-trading over senior positions and concessions to smaller parties. The session ended with the two opposing camps failing to determine which block is largest—a key for the government formation process to move forward

Populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr won the most votes in the May 12 election but his relatively slim margin means he must build a coalition with other groups if he is to gain enough seats to form a government.

His alliance with incumbent Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and others is facing off against a coalition led by former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and factions with close ties to Iran led by paramilitary leader Hadi al-Amiri.

Both are competing to attract Sunni and Kurdish parties, which will typically support the coalition that offers them most concessions. The coalition with the most seats is entitled to nominate a prime minister, who needs the support of a majority of parliament’s 329 members to secure the position. That typically forms part of a larger agreement on who is nominated parliament speaker, president and other positions in Iraq’s fragmented politics.

A lawmaker from Mr. Sadr’s alliance said the session had been called off until Tuesday because lawmakers from the opposing coalition had walked out when it appeared their block wouldn’t be the largest, meaning there was no longer a quorum. “This must be resolved through the federal court and negotiations,” said Alaa al-Rubaie.

Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition against Islamic State, has leaned heavily on Sunni and Kurdish political factions to back the coalition of which Mr. Abadi is part. The U.S., which spent billions of dollars in the fight against the extremist group doesn’t want Iran’s closest allies in Iraq to dictate the formation of a government, especially when it is seeking to curtail Tehran’s influence in the region.

For Iran, having a friendly government in a neighboring country is all the more important as it faces increasing pressure from the Trump administration.

In recent years U.S. and Iranian interests have often converged in Iraq. That was evident during the war against Islamic State, when they found themselves on the same side.

But their agendas are increasingly diverging, putting Iraq in a difficult position as it faces the challenge of rebuilding parts of the country ravaged by years of war against the extremists.

Iraq’s next government must also prevent militants who went to ground after being defeated from regaining traction.

Hours before the new parliament’s opening session, insurgents attacked a village in northern Iraq, killing seven civilians, according to a security official in Kirkuk province where the incident took place.

Anger is also building against a political class that has failed to deliver basic services to large parts of the country in the 15 years since the U.S. toppled Saddam Hussein, despite rising oil revenues. Protests spread across southern Iraq earlier this summer after electricity shortages and have flared again in recent days.

In remarks at the opening of the session, former Speaker of Parliament Saleem al-Jabbouri warned of a “sensitive and dangerous phase”.

“We must protect the historic victory we achieved [against Islamic State],” Mr. Abadi, the incumbent prime minister, said at the start of proceedings.

"The New York Police Department doesn’t properly investigate cases of rape in which the victim is acquainted with the attacker, according to a report released Tuesday by the city’s Department of Investigation, which found the Special Victims Division is “severely understaffed.”

Despite dozens of requests from the SVD and recommendations from a working group formed in 2010 to add more investigators to the unit investigating adult sex crimes, the NYPD didn’t add enough investigators to handle their caseloads, according to the yearlong probe. The Special Victims Division’s adult sex crime units throughout the city’s boroughs had 74 detectives at the end of 2017, two more than those assigned in 2009, despite a 65% increase in caseloads, according to the report. The DOI, a nonpartisan city oversight agency, recommended increasing the number of detectives in the units by 73.

Detectives from the division, who are trained to investigate sex crimes and interview victims, don’t routinely pursue “acquaintance” or “domestic” rape cases after someone has been arrested, according to the report, which cited NYPD internal documents. The post-arrest investigations, crucial for gathering adequate evidence for prosecutors, are instead conducted by local precinct detectives, according to the report.

Additionally, when the division raised concerns about their caseloads in 2011, the NYPD replied “that SVD should simply not investigate every misdemeanor sex crime,” according to the report.

NYPD officials on Tuesday challenged the findings in the report and will soon publish a response to it. High ranking chiefs with knowledge of the division, including chief of detectives Robert Boyce, weren’t questioned for the report, officials said.

“This document is an investigation in name only; it is inaccurate, misleading and does material damage to the relationships of trust the NYPD [SVD] has worked hard to develop with survivors of sex crimes,” NYPD assistant commissioner J. Peter Donald said in a statement.

A DOI spokeswoman said investigators interviewed Chief Michael Osgood, who runs the Special Victims Division, for the report. The findings were based on interviews with former detectives in the unit and internal NYPD documents, the report said. “SVD retirees confirmed to DOI that NYPD leadership pressures SVD to make all resources available for stranger rapes and cases with high media profiles,” the report stated.

“The conclusion from this investigation and the documents we found are that the NYPD does not prioritize sexual assault and in particular instances, does not prioritize acquaintance rape,” said Department of Investigations commissioner Mark Peters. “That is unacceptable in modern law enforcement.”

After police make an arrest, investigating a rape committed by a stranger requires a different approach than investigating a rape by an acquaintance, an official in the detective bureau said. “In a stranger case, we need to establish this is the person who actually did it,” the official said. “In acquaintance cases, we know the victim is known to the perpetrator.”

The report comes as the handling of sexual assault cases throughout the country has been pushed into the spotlight, prompted by the scandals involving celebrities and politicians. New York City has recorded a 9.6% increase in misdemeanor sex crimes and a 32.4% increase in rapes in 2018 compared with the same point last year. NYPD officials earlier this month said the increase in reporting is partially due to the #MeToo movement.

Councilman Donovan Richards, chair of the public safety committee, called the DOI report “troubling.”

“They should not downplay or underplay this issue,” he said of the NYPD. Mr. Richards said the public safety committee plans to hold a hearing April 9 regarding the city’s increase in sex crimes.

Advocates who work with sexual assault victims said the lack of resources in the division has a direct impact on victims who come forward to report the crimes.

“If someone untrained or undertrained is speaking with a victim right there off the bat they’re not getting the high quality information to pursue what happened,” said Jean Bucaria, deputy director of the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women.

The report also contradicts statements made in December by commissioner James O’Neill, according to the DOI. At a Dec. 4 press briefing, Mr. O’Neill said the NYPD had “put more people” into the division and “each rape that is reported is fully investigated by the seasoned professionals in Special Victims.”

In 2017 just four investigators were transferred to the adult sex crime squads in the division, specifically to the squad in Staten Island, in 2017, according the report. But that squad had just nine investigators by the end of 2017 compared with 11 in May of 2017, according to the report.

“I’m a person of my word,” Mr. O’Neill said at the Tuesday briefing. “So to say I was misleading, I find that a little disconcerting.”

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and the city’s largest police union came to a detente on Monday, vowing to end their strife until after two officers fatally shot last weekend were laid to rest.

The tacit agreement came after an extraordinary two days during which police union officials laid partial blame for the deaths of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu at the mayor’s office.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks on Monday during a Police Athletic League Luncheon in Manhattan. Kevin Hagen for The Wall Street Journal

Police Commissioner William Bratton said a viewing for Officer Ramos would take place Friday from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. at Christ Tabernacle Church at 64-34 Myrtle Ave. in New York’s Queens borough. His funeral would then be held on Saturday, with further details to be released shortly, Mr. Bratton said.

Arrangements were being made to assist family members of Officer Liu with passports and other necessary documents to enable them to travel to the U.S. from China so his funeral could take place.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks with NYPD Det. Patrick Blanc during a Police Athletic League luncheon in Manhattan. Kevin Hagen for The Wall Street Journal

Mr. de Blasio also called for protests to end until after the funerals, but some demonstrators said they planned to keep marching. The mayor had been largely supportive of protests that had shut down the city and resulted in some police injuries after grand juries declined to indict officers involved in the deaths of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.

Authorities said the officers’ assailant, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, allegedly wrote online about killing the officers in retaliation for the deaths of Mr. Garner on Staten Island and Mr. Brown in Ferguson, Mo., during confrontations with police this summer.

After going a day without commenting, Mr. de Blasio on Monday called for an end to “political debate” and protests until after the funerals. Mr. de Blasio said the city’s focus should now shift to the grieving families of Officers Ramos and Liu.

“Our first obligation is to respect these families in mourning,” Mr. de Blasio said Monday during a lunchtime speech after visiting with the families of the two slain officers. “It’s time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things that we will talk about in due time.”

“Let’s see them through the funerals,” the mayor said, “then debate can begin again.”

A spokesman for the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association said the union plans to be “silent out of respect for the families of the fallen officers until after the funerals.”

The funerals hadn’t been scheduled as of Monday afternoon.

While Mr. de Blasio has praised police officers, he has angered many rank-and-file members with a 2013 election campaign on overhauling police tactics and statements seen as anti-law-enforcement. For instance he has said minority children—including his own biracial son—should take care when encountering police officers.

On Monday, Mr. de Blasio called the shootings of Officers Liu and Ramos “an attack on all of us. It was an attack on our democracy. It was an attack on our values. It was an attack on every single New Yorker, and we have to see it as such.”

The mayor was speaking at a luncheon for the Police Athletic League, a nonprofit, for the first time following a news conference Saturday night in which officers turned their backs on Mr. de Blasio in a vivid of display of the rift between the mayor and rank-and-file officers.

The mayor reiterated his call that protesters should turn in anyone involved in a demonstration who is engaging in violence or destroying property. “The protesters should join with the police in solidarity to keep the peace and uphold the values of our democracy,” he said.

Mr. de Blasio urged the public to respect all members of the Police Department who are mourning the officers’ deaths. He said the public should thank and console officers on the street “because it is personal for them.”

“We as citizens have an obligation to join in protecting our police just as they protect us,” he said.

“We will find the way to come together,” Mr. de Blasio said.

"Just after Labor Day 2016, when the U.S. presidential race was entering full swing, columnist George F. Will urged Congress to undertake a seemingly futile gesture: He wanted the House to impeach John Koskinen, commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.

Mr. Koskinen had taken over as head of the IRS after it had been exposed for singling out for mistreatment conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status. He lied to Congress when he said he had produced all of Lois Lerner’s emails, allowed documents under subpoena to be destroyed, and generally behaved in a way that helped ensure there would be no hard consequences for the abuses. Though Mr. Koskinen had only a few months left on the job, Mr. Will argued that impeaching him might help Congress restore its much diminished standing as a coequal branch of government.

Not quite two years later, Congress continues to pay the price for letting Ms. Lerner and Mr. Koskinen ride freely into the sunset. Though the IRS and other federal agencies—including the State and Justice Departments, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation—are now headed by Trump rather than Obama appointees, they continue to spurn congressional oversight demands with near impunity.

Here’s one example: When House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes subpoenaed documents and testimony from the FBI and Justice Department, he was stonewalled for months. In a last-minute bid to circumvent the committee’s demands, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with Speaker Paul Ryan. The two men ended up agreeing to comply with the subpoenas—but only because Mr. Ryan informed them they would be found in contempt if they did not.

This kind of stonewalling has fed the agitation on Capitol Hill for a second special counsel, who would look into everything from the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email investigation to the use of the Christopher Steele dossier to obtain warrants to listen in on members of the Trump campaign. The calls are mistaken. But the frustration is real, and the people demanding a new special counsel—from Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham in the Senate to Kevin McCarthy and Bob Goodlatte in the House—are no fringe players.

These calls proceed despite an imminent report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department’s inspector general. The report promises to reveal telling details about what went on at Justice and the FBI, including why the FBI itself would come to recommend the firing of Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. But those pushing for a special counsel say an inspector general is not enough, because he has limited power to subpoena and no power to indict.

All this is true. But missing here is any discussion of the powers Congress itself has, including but not limited to the subpoena and contempt powers that ultimately forced Mr. Wray and Mr. Rosenstein into compliance.

If it only has the backbone, Congress can get what it wants out of the federal bureaucracy. Several executive-branch officials—including Justice’s Bruce Ohr and FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page—will soon testify before the House Intelligence Committee. Possibly some or all of them will invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

If Congress insists on its prerogatives, however, that wouldn’t be the end of the story. Witnesses who plead the Fifth can still be compelled to testify. The price is that the compelled testimony, and evidence derived from that testimony, couldn’t be used against the witness in a prosecution.

A special counsel might not like this, given his emphasis on indictments and prosecutions. But Congress should, because its end goal is political accountability. Which would be up to the American people to impose after learning exactly what abuses have transpired.

Of course, Congress has its own ways of showing its displeasure, including cutting the budgets of recalcitrant agencies. Given budget rules, this would require the cooperation of some Democrats, who are unlikely to go along. Nevertheless, the power of the purse remains a tool Congress can use to make the executive branch pay a price for its actions.

Above all, there is impeachment. The constitutional power to remove officials from office for “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors” is a writ far broader than anything a special counsel enjoys.

Then again, it’s not easy to impeach a federal official, and it shouldn’t be. As Mr. Will pointed out in his column calling for Mr. Koskinen’s impeachment, “no appointed official of the executive branch has been impeached in 140 years.” Mr. Koskinen was not impeached, and he and Ms. Lerner rode off into the sunset without having to answer for their actions and deceits.

Ask yourself this: Is it likely our federal agencies would be so haughty about Congress and its subpoenas if Mr. Koskinen had been impeached?

So instead of whingy calls for another special counsel, a Congress that behaved as a branch of government coequal to the presidency would use its own powers to force oversight on resisting federal officials. Even if this might ultimately include impeaching FBI Director Christopher Wray.

"President Donald Trump accepted an invitation to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the White House said Thursday, a meeting that would mark the first time a serving U.S. president has sat down with the leadership of the heavily militarized and diplomatically isolated country.

The leader-to-leader meeting, which American officials said would take place within the next few months at a location yet to be determined, is a potential turning point after more than six decades of confrontation involving North Korea, its southern neighbor and South Korea’s allies.

But it also stands to sharply raise the diplomatic stakes in one of the world’s most volatile standoffs.

American officials acknowledged that it was unusual for such a face-to-face session to be arranged without an extensive series of preparatory meetings between lower-ranking officials. But they asserted that it was justified because Mr. Kim was the only person able to make decisions in his “uniquely authoritarian” regime and that Mr. Trump was known as a deal maker.

“At this point we are not even talking about negotiations,” a senior U.S. official said, while stressing that the U.S.’s ultimate goal was complete denuclearization by North Korea, subject to stringent verification.

Progress in an encounter between two strong-willed leaders could set the terms for painstaking negotiations, carried out by aides, to eliminate North Korea’s nuclear arsenal in return for security guarantees. But a failure by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim to make headway could lead each side to double down on their demands and perhaps heighten the possibility of conflict.

By all accounts, the obstacles to an agreement are formidable. Just last month, U.S. intelligence agencies predicted that North Korea would press ahead with more missile tests and would resist negotiating away its nuclear arsenal.

But on Thursday, South Korea’s national-security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, conveyed Mr. Kim’s invitation to meet and noted that North Korea had promised to suspend nuclear and missile tests while it engages in talks on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

In a tweet, Mr. Trump said he believed he was seeing “great progress” from North Korea.

“Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!” he wrote.

Mr. Trump spoke Thursday evening with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is traveling in Africa. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan was at meetings at the White House Thursday, with top White House officials and the South Korean representatives who brought the offer from Mr. Kim.

Based on initial reactions, the coming days will bring debate over the implications posed by talks: Does a leader-to-leader meeting elevate and legitimize Mr. Kim; will it defuse tensions or complicate them; would it make the prospect of war more remote, if talks succeed, or more imminent, if they collapse?

Newsletter Sign-up

“Skepticism and caution are critical as these discussions continue,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

If high-level talks get under way, a key question will be what North Korea and the U.S. mean when they talk about “denuclearization.” The underlying assumption of American policy has long been that it means a North Korea without any nuclear weapons or a nuclear-weapons program.

But to the North Koreans, the term could mean much less than that. The North may define denuclearization as a long-term goal that would only be achieved after the U.S. withdraws troops from South Korea and effectively ends the U.S.-South Korean military alliance. One former official says that to be negotiable, denuclearization could mean a freeze in North Korean missile and nuclear testing now, followed by an understanding that no further weapons will be built, with the goal of actually eliminating the weapons already have built years down the road.

Lawmakers from both parties on Thursday welcomed Mr. Trump’s decision to talk to Mr. Kim, though some expressed reservations.

Rep. Ed Royce (R., Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Trump administration must ensure Pyongyang’s offer isn’t a bid to buy time to work on its program.

“North Korean regimes have repeatedly used talks and empty promises to extract concessions and buy time,” he said. “We’ve got to break this cycle.”

But a failure of the high-stakes diplomatic bid shouldn’t become a pretext for armed conflict, said Sen. Ed Markey (D., Mass.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “If the talks between the two leaders do not go well, it is not an excuse to justify military action for a situation that has no military solution.”

North Korea’s leaders have never met a sitting U.S. president, though Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton met with Mr. Kim’s grandfather and father, respectively, after they left the White House.

Unusually, Mr. Trump’s decision wasn’t first announced by the White House. Instead, Mr. Chung and South Korea’s intelligence chief, Sun Hoon, stood at microphones outside the White House Thursday evening to announce Mr. Kim’s offer and Mr. Trump’s acceptance. The White House confirmed it later.

They said Mr. Kim had confirmed that he was prepared to suspend nuclear weapons and missile tests and agreed to discuss eliminating his nation’s nuclear arsenal.

They also said Mr. Kim wouldn’t object to U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers, scheduled to take place next month in the region.

The move is the latest twist in a long saga of failed diplomacy and threats issues by both sides. During his first year in office, Mr. Trump has swung between angry denunciations of Mr. Kim and suggestions that he was willing to sit down with the North Korean leader.

In a September appearance at the U.N., Mr. Trump said the U.S. would “totally destroy North Korea” if attacked and vowed that Mr. Kim would not survive the devastations. “Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself,” Mr. Trump said.

In a January news conference at Camp David, Mr. Trump said he was open to speaking to Mr. Kim if he could lead to a peaceful resolution of the American demands that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal. “I always believe in talking,” he said.

"WASHINGTON—Senators reached an agreement on bipartisan legislation to overhaul the Capitol’s sexual-harassment policies, including prohibiting the use of taxpayer funds to pay settlements.

That requirement and other key provisions mirror a bill passed by the House in February, which would also make it easier for victims to report harassment. It would eliminate both the 30-day “counseling” period and mandatory mediation required by current policy. Cases involving lawmakers would be referred to the ethics committee in the chamber where the lawmaker serves.

The Senate bill, announced Wednesday, also would ensure that lawmakers found guilty of harassment who leave office be held responsible for repaying any settlement, including through nongovernment wages or retirement accounts, if necessary. Senior staff accused of sexual harassment wouldn’t be personally liable if a case is settled.

The measure has the support of the leadership of both parties, and aides say the bill could see a vote by the end of the week.

“This bipartisan agreement sends a clear message that harassment in any form will not be tolerated in the U.S. Congress,” said Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), who led the effort with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the panel. Both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) hailed the agreement.

The Senate bill also narrows the definition of what would be considered a violation; it is defined as unwelcome sexual advances or sexual harassment that interferes with work performance or creates a hostile working environment. The House version doesn’t get that detailed. The current law blocks discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.

The push for an overhaul of Congress’s procedures for handling sexual-harassment cases took on new urgency last year when it was revealed that some lawmakers had used taxpayer funds to pay settlements to their accusers. The revelations, which came amid a nationwide movement to curb harassment in businesses, media, Hollywood and politics, prompted lawmakers to examine their own policies.

At least $600,000 in taxpayer funds has gone to settling workplace misconduct claims in the Senate over the past 20 years, according to data released last year by the Rules Committee.

"WARSAW—Tens of thousands of Poles marched across downtown Warsaw on Saturday, in an independence-day procession organized by a nationalist youth movement that seeks an ethnically pure Poland with fewer Jews or Muslims.

The largely young crowd shot off roman candles and many chanted “fatherland,” carrying banners that read “White Europe,” “Europe Will Be White” and “Clean Blood.” Some of the marchers flew in from Hungary, Slovakia and Spain and waved flags and symbols that those countries used during their wartime collaboration with Nazi Germany.

A number of people in the crowd said they didn’t belong to any neo-fascist or racist organization but didn’t see a problem with the overall tone of what has become Poland’s biggest independence day event.

“There are of course nationalists and fascists at this march,” said Mateusz, a 27-year-old wrapped in a Polish flag, “I’m fine with it. I’m just happy to be here.”

The march, organized by a group called the National Radical Camp, underscores the rightward politics of a growing section of Polish youth. The Radical Camp presents itself as the heir to a 1930s fascist movement of the same name, which fought to rid Poland of Jews in the years just before the Holocaust. A second group, All Polish Youth, also named after an anti-Jewish interwar movement, co-organized it.

Officials in the city government said they thought the march reflected poorly on Poland, but they said they had no choice but to approve the demonstration, as it fulfilled the legal requirements: It qualified as a celebration of Polish history. “This is not the type of event I would take my children to,” said Agnieszka Kłąb, spokesperson for the Warsaw City Council.

The Radical Camp has been holding independence-day marches since 2009. Until several years ago, it struggled to attract more than a few hundred people. In the past three years, it has become the largest independence-day occasion in Poland, and one of the largest nationalist marches of its kind anywhere in Europe. Saturday’s was expected to be the largest ever. Police estimated the crowd at 60,000.

“It’s getting more and more vicious,” said Jakub Skrzypek, 25, one of about a dozen counterprotesters standing behind a banner that read “We Are Polish Jews” and surrounded by police. “We are really in fear.”

The Radical Camp’s followers argue, on their social-media accounts and in their literature, that the influx of Syrian refugees into Europe is part of a conspiracy driven by Jewish financiers, who are working with Communists in the European Union to bring Muslims into Europe, and with them, Shariah law and homosexuality.

The group has regularly held events to mark a 1936 pogrom against Jews. Its symbols were displayed on a banner that appeared over a bridge in Poznan, reading: “Pray for Islamic Holocaust.”

This year, the group said it was adopting a new slogan—“We want God”—a nod to President Donald Trump, who in a July speech here quoted that saying, which comes from a traditional Polish song.

“This march is just an expression of a bigger social phenomenon, which is definitely very troubling, and is the growing acceptance of extreme nationalism and xenophobia among young people in Poland,” said Rafal Pankowski, a political-science professor at private university Collegium Civitas in Warsaw. “It is a contrast: Polish parents and grandparents are paradoxically more liberal than their young.”

Richard Spencer, an American until recently banned from 26 European countries who wants to create a country just for white people in North America, was invited. The Polish government asked him to stay home, and he didn’t show up. Roberto Fiore, an Italian anti-immigration politician who describes himself as a fascist, was scheduled to appear.

Some Poles on Facebook and Twitter said they were staying away from the city center on their country’s independence day, to avoid potential violence. Three previous years’ marches devolved into tear-gas-clouded scuffles with police. Police detained at least 45 people Saturday.

The crowds drawn to Saturday’s march reflect the politics taking hold in the soccer clubs and youth hangouts where Radical Camp recruits. The group holds a staunch nativist standpoint, saying the European Union and Russia represent equal threats to Polish sovereignty. It argues that Polish people should nationalize the assets belonging to foreign corporations and distribute the profits across an ethnically homogenous state

Similar movements have taken hold—even captured seats in parliament—in Hungary, Slovakia and Czech Republic. Some of these countries are among Europe’s most prospering. Poland is the only country in the EU that didn’t experience a single quarter of economic contraction after the financial crisis.

Still, the fear that Poland is under siege by distant elites has captured the imagination of some here, as has the worry that hordes of immigrants could soon pour over the border. Government-controlled media broadcasts near-nightly reports on crimes committed by Muslims in Europe. On Saturday, Polish state television called the procession a “great march of patriots.

“It’s like this inner need we have,” said Lukasz, a 24-year-old protester. “We want a Poland that will be for Polish people.”

(Nov. 14) Clarification: The slogan for Saturday’s independence-day march, “We want God,” comes from an old Polish song, which U.S. President Donald Trump quoted in July during a speech in Warsaw. An earlier version of this article didn’t specify that the quote from Mr. Trump’s speech was a reference to the song, which Poles used to respond to Pope John Paul II during a 1979 visit to the country.

"SEOUL—The South Korean government is investigating the whereabouts of thousands of tons of suspected North Korean coal that entered its ports last year despite a ban on such shipments, in what would be another example of Pyongyang exploiting gaps in the U.S.-led sanctions regime.

About 9,000 tons of North Korean coal, worth at least $325,000, appear to have been shipped to South Korea in October after having been unloaded and reloaded in the port of Kholmsk, on the Russian island of Sakhalin, in an apparent attempt to obscure the origin of the coal, according to a South Korean Foreign Ministry official and a United Nations report.

The coal was unloaded at South Korean ports and processed by customs officials, but Seoul officials are unsure what happened to the coal thereafter, the foreign ministry official said.

The Seoul investigation into the coal raises new concerns around North Korea’s use of foreign ports, particularly those in Russia, to sidestep international sanctions aimed at limiting the regime’s ability to sell its coal on the global market to raise funds for its nuclear and missile programs. The U.N. banned North Korea from trading coal last August.

The disclosure of the coal shipments, delivered to the South Korean ports of Incheon and Pohang on October 2 and 11 last year respectively, came in a March report by a U.N. Panel of Experts that was updated on June 27 but that prompted a South Korean public response only this week.

The use of Kholmsk as a transfer site for North Korean coal exports was reported earlier this year by the Washington Post.

South Korea’s investigation into coal exports comes even as its liberal government pursues a policy of engagement with Pyongyang and lays the groundwork for potential investment in North Korea, once sanctions are lifted.

Despite a recent diplomatic thaw between the U.S. and North Korea, United Nations sanctions remain in force against Pyongyang. The South Korean government said it cooperates with the international community to enforce sanctions and has reported potential violations to the U.N.

Last year, South Korea detained two ships suspected of supporting North Korean efforts to evade sanctions and earlier this year detained a third on similar suspicions.

“South Korean enforcement agencies first detected the North Korean coal and began investigations before reporting the findings to the U.N.,” a spokesman for South Korea’s Unification Ministry said Wednesday.

A Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday that Seoul has been aware that the coal shipments’ likely origin in North Korea since they occurred in October, adding that Seoul subsequently reported the shipment to the U.N.

South Korean officials conducted the “necessary investigations” and inspected two of the ships, the Panama-flagged Sky Angel, and the Sierra Leone-flagged Rich Glory, which delivered 4,000 and 5,000 tons of coal respectively in October, this official added.

The amount of coal delivered by the Sky Angel wasn’t mentioned in the U.N. report. The Sky Angel has since been reflagged as a Chinese ship, according to the U.N. report.

It is unclear why the coal shipments were allowed to be unloaded at South Korean ports and whether South Korean customs officials were aware at the time of the possibility that the coal came from North Korea, the Foreign Ministry official said. He added that a report to customs authorities had identified the coal as being Russian in origin.

The official also said the ships weren’t detained in part because U.N. sanctions at the time didn’t mandate the seizure of ships unless they had a record of evading sanctions.

South Korea’s investigation focuses on whether the coal imports indeed originated from North Korea, and how much of it was taken in by South Korean entities and how much was shipped elsewhere, he added.

The U.N. report lists the North Korean ports of Wonsan and Chongjin as the likely sources of the 9,000 tons of coal that arrived in South Korea.

"MUNICH—European officials are intensifying their efforts to save the Iranian nuclear deal, opening a new channel to press Tehran to curtail its military involvement in neighboring conflicts just as tensions spiral throughout the Middle East.

European diplomats sat down with a senior Iranian official over the weekend on the sidelines of a major security conference in Munich. They hope to check Iranian activity in Yemen, Syria and other parts of the Middle East as a way to show U.S. President Donald Trump that Iranian expansion can be reversed while sticking with the nuclear agreement.

Mr. Trump has threatened to kill the Iranian nuclear deal in May, when he must decide whether to keep in place sanctions waivers required under the 2015 agreement. The nuclear deal lifted most international sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran tightly restricting its nuclear program.

Administration officials have complained the 2015 agreement does nothing to check Iran’s regional actions. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Sunday Tehran had “doubled down” on its regional meddling after concluding the deal.

U.S. national security adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster on Saturday accused Iran of building a network of proxy forces, like Hezbollah, and arming them with increasingly sophisticated weaponry.

“So the time is now…to act against Iran,” Gen. McMaster said in Munich.

Chaired by the European Union, the meeting on Saturday morning was attended by senior officials from Italy, Germany, Britain and France, and Iran’s powerful Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, also a key player in negotiating the nuclear deal. The focus of discussions was the conflict in Yemen, according to Western and Iranian officials.

Those officials said talks will likely turn to Syria, the scene of escalating tensions, in particular between Iran and Israel.

Earlier this month, Israel launched attacks on Syrian air defenses and Iranian fighters in Syria after Israel intercepted an Iranian drone launched from Syria. An Israeli jet was shot down during the attacks.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned in Munich on Sunday that Israel won’t accept an Iranian presence close to its border in southern Syria and could strike Iran directly if Tehran doesn’t back away.

“We will act without hesitation to defend ourselves,” he said. “And we will act if necessary not just against Iran’s proxies but against Iran itself.”

European governments, which have strongly supported the Iranian nuclear agreement, have pledged to work with Washington to address nonnuclear concerns, such as Iran’s missile program and its regional activities. However they say this should happen separate from discussion on the nuclear deal and that they won’t renegotiate the 2015 deal.

European and U.S. officials set up working groups last month to discuss these issues. Around the same time, the Europeans agreed with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to start discussing regional issues in the new format.

Over the weekend, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned that while the EU would maintain its support for the Iranian nuclear deal, Europe was ready to work with the U.S. against “the destabilizing influence of Iranian policies in the region and to push them back.”

France has said Iranian firms or people could be targeted with new sanctions over its missile program.

Iran has refused to enter discussions on ballistic missiles, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who controls security policy, saying on Sunday that Western countries want to keep Iran weak so they can “bully them.” Iranian officials note Western countries are making large arms sales to their regional foes, like Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Iranian officials have called on Europe to stick by the nuclear deal. Mr. Zarif warned on Sunday that if the nuclear deal is undermined, “Iran will respond, will respond seriously.”

Iranian officials said they have long called for more active European diplomacy on regional tensions. However it is unclear whether they will give any ground in talks. While EU economic sanctions give the bloc some leverage, Europe has no significant military presence in the region to curtail Iran’s ambitions.

On Sunday on his semiofficial Twitter feed, Mr. Khamenei lambasted European countries for bowing to U.S. pressure on Iran.

“On nuclear talks, we trusted them,” he said of Western governments. “we didn’t benefit from that trust.”

European officials have said that to work with Washington on their concerns about Iran, they expect Mr. Trump to end uncertainty over the nuclear deal’s fate. Many complain that the U.S. demands for sticking by the deal remain vague.

In Munich, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan sought to respond to that. He said that by the time of Mr. Trump’s next Iran deal deadline on May 12, Washington hoped to win “a commitment that we can…credibly show to the president (that) we’re making progress” to address the deal’s flaws and Iran’s missiles and regional actions.

"A Chinese middleman who is allegedly one of the largest facilitators of North Korean trade invested around $500,000 with his wife in a fund that put them on a path toward becoming U.S. permanent residents, according to a court document filed on Thursday.

Law-enforcement officials seized the funds in October, and the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington filed a complaint Thursday to forfeit the funds from Chi Yupeng and his wife, Zhang Bing.

The disclosure appears to expose a loophole in the much-debated EB-5 visa program that allowed the pair to make the investment in 2015, and remain invested in the project until the funds were seized, despite being on a U.S. sanctions list.

Mr. Chi and his company were added in August to a Treasury Department list of entities and people who the U.S. government says help facilitate North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program. On that same day, the U.S. attorney’s office filed a case seeking to forfeit other funds Mr. Chi’s company allegedly tried to route through U.S. banks.

The Washington-based C4ADS, which studies transnational threats, has previously identified Mr. Chi’s company, Dandong Zhicheng, as the biggest importer of North Korean goods into China. Prosecutors have alleged the company helped facilitate North Korea’s coal trade, which the U.S. has estimated generates more than $1 billion in revenue a year for North Korea and helps fuel its weapons programs.

The couple couldn't be reached for comment. An attorney for them couldn't immediately be located.

The new forfeiture filing comes as the Trump administration is pressing Chinese officials to expel North Korean agents helping finance Pyongyang’s nuclear-weapons and missile programs. The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on 16 North Korean agents accused of operating largely in China as representatives of North Korea’s banned banks and weapons programs.

The EB-5 program offers green cards to aspiring immigrants who invest at least $500,000 in U.S. businesses in high-unemployment or rural areas that have been determined to create at least 10 jobs per investor. A green card permits a foreign national to live and work in the U.S.

The majority of EB-5 visas go to wealthy Chinese individuals, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security. The U.S. government limits the number of EB-5 visas to 10,000 a year.

The EB-5 program has been criticized for favoring wealthy immigrants and for channeling most of the funds to upscale neighborhoods, rather than the economically disadvantaged areas for which the program was intended.

Some developers and middlemen who have raised money through the program also have been alleged to be involved in fraudulent schemes aimed at taking advantage of applicants.

Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been examining the use of the EB-5 program by the real-estate company run by the family of Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. A spokeswoman for Kushner Cos. has previously said the company fully complied with EB-5 rules and regulations and did nothing improper.

Thursday’s complaint appears to be one of the first instances of alleged misconduct on the part of an investor seeking to obtain a visa through the program.

The filing, which amends an earlier complaint targeting other funds, says a U.S. bank account maintained by a family member of Mr. Chi and Ms. Zhang received a series of wire transfers in November 2015. Immediately following those transfers, that account wired $550,100 to a regional EB-5 investment program, referencing Ms. Zhang.

Ms. Zhang and Mr. Chi have applied for an EB-5 visa, the complaint said. Ms. Zhang also told the U.S. government at an immigration checkpoint in June 2016 that she and Mr. Chi were planning to become investment immigrants, the document said.

Prosecutors also said the initial 12 wire transfers to the relative’s U.S. account each fell under $50,000, which appeared designed to avoid a Chinese government limit of $50,000 per year on foreign capital outflow by any one individual.

The complaint cited two North Korean defectors who said people behind North Korea’s financial facilitators frequently use accounts in their own names or those of family members, rather than those of their better-known companies, to move U.S. dollars and circumvent prohibitions on using the U.S. financial system.

"WASHINGTON—The botched terror attack in New York this week has created a fresh test for a new counterterrorism force tackling a growing U.S. concern: international extremism in Bangladesh, home of the suspect.

The Bangladesh-based Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime unit spearheading a probe into the failed attack, set up with U.S. help last year, was expected to focus on crime. But it was given a broad mandate to fight terrorism after an attack last year on a bakery in Dhaka the capital killed 20 people, mostly foreigners, including one U.S. citizen.

The crime unit now is working alongside the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine if the New York attacker, Akayed Ullah, had any links to local militant groups, putting an unwelcome spotlight on a problem the government has sought to play down in recent years. Mr. Ullah said he was inspired by Islamic State.

Until recently, the influence of transnational terrorist groups was considered comparatively small in the secular, mostly Sufi Muslim country of around 160 million people, which had been spared the extremism and sectarian conflict that has plagued neighbors like Pakistan.

Economic growth rates averaging around 6% over the past decade, according to the World Bank, has lifted millions out of poverty and the government is hoping to set Bangladesh on the same path as India or China.

“It’s still something that’s new for Bangladesh,” one Western security official in the country said, commenting on the government’s reluctance to link a pattern of attacks to global terrorist groups. “They don’t want to inspire fear in the local population and the expat community.”

A local Islamic State branch claimed responsibility for 18 attacks in Bangladesh last year, according to the State Department’s counterterrorism bureau, while Al Qaeda waged an assassination campaign against secular activists and bloggers and claimed two attacks including the killing of a local U.S. embassy employee.

The emergence of a small group of extremists claiming allegiance to either a local branch of Al Qaeda or Islamic State has rattled the government and unnerved the country’s huge aid and business community.

The U.S. Embassy has introduced additional security measures, including removing employee families from the country, making Bangladesh into what officials call a non-accompanied post.

Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the prime minister, has led an effective but brutal crackdown on alleged militants that has helped remove Islamic State leaders from the country.

The U.S. is bolstering local counterterrorism efforts with law-enforcement training and justice training, while American special operations forces are working with the Bangladeshi coast guard and other, including the unit that responded to the bakery attack last year.

“Terrorist organizations are losing their strength,” deputy counterterrorism commissioner Saiful Islam said in an interview this week.

Related Video A bomber partially detonated a home-made explosive at a Manhattan subway terminal Monday in an attempted terrorist attack. The suspect suffered severe burns and was taken into custody by the police. Photo: Twitter/@Breaking911

Mr. Islam’s forces are investigating whether the New York bomber had any ties to local groups. He said nothing suspicious has emerged after interviews with the man’s family and associates. The bomber had probably been radicalized abroad, he said.

After a surge in incidents last year, terrorist groups have yet to stage anything on the scale of the bakery attack and the ensuing government crackdown appears to have hampered Islamic State efforts to expand in the country.

“Though it once seemed likely that [Islamic State] would eclipse al Qaeda in Bangladesh, momentum within the Bangladeshi jihadist landscape has now shifted decisively in al Qaeda’s favor,” Nathaniel Barr, now at the U.S. Defense Department, wrote earlier this month for the Jamestown Foundation while a private security consultant.

The country is confronting political strife, with increasingly bitter relations between the ruling secular Bangladesh Awami League, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and the opposition Bangladesh National Party, which is close to Islamist groups.

The influx of over 646,000 Rohingya refugees fleeing neighboring Myanmar is an additional burden that could stir more resentment among Islamist groups in the country.

“The political landscape has become extremely polarized and combustible,” said Dr. Matthew J. Nelson at the SOAS South Asia Institute. “This is extremely concerning.”

The government also faces the challenge of keeping up with rapid economic expansion that created huge shortfalls in infrastructure, energy and other urban needs, while there are still 28 million people below the poverty line.

With Bangladesh confronting a multitude of political and social challenges, the U.S. and others also are promoting a soft-power approach that involves teaching families to look for warning signs of extremism, and entails working on education and development initiatives.

Faiz Sobhan, research director at the Bangladesh Enterprise Institute, who is involved in such efforts, believes that much of the extremism is being fueled by events outside the country. “We have become a victim of what is happening globally.”

"Donald Trump is something new to the American political landscape. But to many in Latin America he is—stylistically, at least—a far more familiar figure: the caudillo, or authoritarian populist.

In recent weeks, growing numbers of newspapers across Latin America have tried to explain the rise of Mr. Trump to bewildered local audiences by pointing to the region’s own strongmen, a long list that includes Venezuela’s late Hugo Chávez and Ecuador’s current president, Rafael Correa.

In a recent op-ed in El Universal, a leading Venezuelan daily, the journalist Roberto Giusti described Chávez and Mr. Trump as “consummate showmen with a shrewd ability to manage emotions of a large audience and, using a mixture of half-truths, pin the blame for people’s ills on enemies, real or imagined.”

Like Mr. Trump, Latin American caudillos recognize and exploit real grievances in their countries. They confront an ossified political establishment, develop a strong bond with their followers and attack their opponents and the media with no holds barred—sometimes even encouraging violence. ​

“A lot of people in Mexico and Latin America are worried about this. It’s not just the substance of what Trump says, but it’s the style. It’s a familiar and worrisome style to us,” says Jorge Castaneda, Mexico’s former foreign minister.

All populists—of the left and the right—tell narratives that place the blame for the people’s troubles on others and free the people from responsibility, says Moisés Naim, a former Venezuelan cabinet minister.

For many Latin American populists, the poor are victimized by big business and corrupt politicians working with the “empire,” meaning the U.S. For Mr. Trump, America’s working class is bedeviled by immigrants and an inept leadership that gets suckered by savvy Chinese and Mexican governments into enacting lopsided trade deals.

Mr. Trump isn’t the only U.S. presidential candidate with a populist streak. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders serves up a strong dose of economic populism—a narrative of rich-vs.-poor that would fit comfortably in the rhetoric of a Latin American socialist. Hillary Clinton has started sounding such themes more loudly too. And Mr. Sanders also has populist, protectionist views on trade—something he shares with Mr. Trump.

But to many observers in the region, Mr. Trump’s style provides the obvious parallel to the caudillo. The best example of the type remains Argentine strongman Juan Domingo Perón. As a military attaché in Italy from 1939-41, Perón saw how the fascist leader Benito Mussolini used nationalism and a direct connection with the people, cultivated through rallies and radio, to develop a cult of personality and become “Il Duce.”

Like their fascist forebears, that direct link between leader and people is the most important trait of authoritarian populists, according to Enrique Krauze, a Mexican historian who says that Mexico’s fiery Andrés Manuel López Obrador fits the profile. Mr. López Obrador lost bids for the country’s presidency in 2006 and 2012, but he is currently leading in opinion polls for the 2018 election.

All good politicians try to connect with large numbers of citizens, but in the case of caudillos, the movement develops into a cult of personality. The politician becomes an almost messianic figure, an incarnation of the people’s desires and a personality that towers above institutions like political parties.

Perón led to Perónismo. Chávez created Chávismo. And already there is talk about Trumpism—or, as Latin Americans call it, “Trumpismo.”

“It’s like déjà vu,” said Roger Noriega, the top diplomat for Latin America in the George W. Bush administration. In a recent tweet, he wrote that Chávez “got 56% in 1998; middle class voters wanted to shake up system, make Venezuela great. His narcissism destroyed the country.” He labeled his remark with the hashtag #Trump.

Television helps to reinforce the direct link between such a leader and the people. Long before becoming a politician, Mr. Trump built his brand as a reality-television star. Chávez amassed power, in part, by creating a sort of reality-television presidency. On the show that he launched, he would sit for hours, telling stories and ribald jokes and sometimes breaking into song. He was also an early adopter of Twitter and had millions of followers.

Michael Penfold, the co-author of a book on Chávez, sees a similar media strategy at work with Mr. Trump. “Both guys knew what headline they wanted to see the following day,” he said, “and worked backward from there.”

“Followers behave more like members of a cult than followers of a political party,” wrote economist Sergio Negrete in Mexico’s El Universal newspaper, comparing Mr. Trump with his own country’s Mr. López Obrador. Others have noted that both men have asked supporters at rallies to raise their hands in pledges of support.

Virtually all caudillos also share an alpha-male personality. Ecuador’s Rafael Correa once accosted police who were on strike, tearing open his shirt and screaming at them to shoot him in the chest, “if you dare.” Mr. Trump has talked about wanting to punch protesters “in the face.” And he has defended his manhood. Chávez once said on television that his wife should get ready because “tonight, I will give you what is yours.”

“The body language of these types is very similar: an alpha primate, someone always on the edge of violence,” said Carlos Alberto Montaner, a Cuban exile who has written extensively on Fidel Castro and other Latin American caudillos. “It’s a kind of admiration for the alpha male that gives them a big edge. It’s like the girls in high-school falling for the jock.”

Opponents, therefore, are not just to be challenged but mocked and humiliated. Chávez called the 40% of Venezuelans who didn’t support him “the squalid ones,” dubbed rival politicians traitors or lap dogs (he called one politician “a fly”) and had a virtual dictionary for then-U.S. President George W. Bush: a donkey, the devil, a coward, a drunk and Mr. Danger.

Independent media outlets have often been targets for Latin America’s autocratic populists. Ecuador’s Mr. Correa calls the press “lowlifes,” sued the country’s leading newspaper for $40 million and pressed criminal charges against its editors. Mr. López Obrador has claimed for years there is a media conspiracy against him. His supporters have occasionally accosted journalists at rallies.

Chávez went further: He simply shut down independent broadcasters and set up state propaganda networks. Mr. Trump has railed against many major media outlets and vowed that, once in office, he would change libel laws to make it easier to sue.

Mr. Naim thinks that a President Trump would be hemmed in by the U.S.’s strong institutions and system of checks and balances. But he worries that the rise of Mr. Trump is part of a global trend of voters who are fed up with political parties. In the U.S., he said, gerrymandering has weakened both parties and created gridlock.

“The trouble is, what happens if parties collapse?” he said. “You get caudillos.”

"TORONTO—Canada’s technology sector, which has long struggled to compete with sunny Silicon Valley, is seizing on the U.S.’s hardening stance on immigration in a bid to lure top talent.

The pitch: Come to Canada, where there are cosmopolitan cities, affordable health care and, most important, more certainty around work permits and entrance requirements that many executives feel is lacking under the Trump administration.

Ben Zifkin, chief executive of Hubba Inc., tells potential employees currently in the U.S.: “You don’t have to stay in Canada forever, just the current presidential term.” The company, based in Toronto, helps online retailers manage product information.

Mr. Zifkin says he is only half-joking. But his message is part of a coordinated push for talent by Canadian executives, government officials and venture capitalists to pounce on what they see as a rare opportunity for the nation’s maturing tech sector.

“A year ago, the only people I could talk to were ex-Canadians who missed home, but the talent was lacking,” said Mr. Zifkin, who returned last month from a recruiting trip in the San Francisco Bay Area. There, he met with 20 candidates for senior management positions. “This time it’s much better.”

The effort comes as the Trump administration in April launched a review aimed at stricter enforcement of immigration rules and other laws governing entry of workers into the U.S. Any changes could affect thousands of foreigners on H1-B visas, widely used to employ high-skilled workers in the U.S. tech and other white-collar sectors.

“You’re running a startup. You’re involved in one of the most uncertain businesses of all time,” Ray Sharma, CEO of Extreme Venture Partners, says he tells tech founders who aren’t U.S. citizens but are living in the U.S. or considering it. “Now you’re introducing your residency as part of that uncertainty? That’s crazy.”

Extreme Venture, a venture-capital firm based in Toronto, helps relocate startups based in the U.S. and elsewhere to Canada and assists in securing Canadian citizenship for employees.

“It’s such an easy sell sometimes,” said Mr. Sharma. “It’s like, ’You had me at Canada.’”

One taker was fulfil.io, a cloud-based software platform that aids companies in their supply-chain operations. Two of the company’s founders decided to come to Canada in May from their native India after they had to leave the U.S. when their H1-B visas expired and renewal proved difficult. They closed their first sales deal a month later.

“Canada looks like the right place to grow,” said one, Sharoon Thomas, fulfil.io CEO. “I’m just surprised that we didn’t think of it first.”

It can still be difficult to poach engineers and programmers from Silicon Valley, where large tech firms such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc. reign. There, the salaries are higher, the venture-capital sector bigger and the winters warmer.

Meredith Trotter, a data scientist at Lumiata Inc., an artificial-intelligence analytics firm in San Mateo, Calif., said she has plans to return to her native Canada but hasn’t found anything superior to her current job that would compel her to make the move now. “Even when those jobs start becoming real, I’m not sure I’ll be ready to go home,” Ms. Trotter said.

Until recently, it could take as much as a year for foreigners offered a job in Canada to receive a work permit, which immigration lawyer Joel Guberman said was “unworkable.”

But last month, the Canadian government announced a pilot program aimed at cutting this kind of wait and the red tape involved. Under the program, work permits and temporary resident visas are issued in two weeks instead of one year.

Platterz Inc., an online-catering platform, has already used the government program for three new hires, two of whom arrived in Canada last week. “When we started, we had someone from the government call us every day to walk us through the process,” said Eran Henig, CEO of the Toronto startup. “I never would have expected that kind of attention from the government.”

Canada’s stepped-up recruitment effort is getting under way at a time of expansion in its tech industry. Several startups such as Shopify Inc., which develops software for online retailers, and Real Matters Inc., a real-estate data and software firm, have launched initial public offerings in recent years. The country is becoming a key hub for artificial intelligence. Venture-capital investment hit a record in 2016, with C$3.7 billion ($3.0 billion) invested in 571 deals, with total value up 37% from the previous year, according to Thomson Reuters.

Despite the gains, that is still a fraction of similar types of investment activity in the U.S.

Ontario, home to most of Canada’s tech firms, plans to launch an ad campaign later this year targeting workers and executives in Silicon Valley. In November, Salim Teja, president of venture services for MaRS, a Toronto tech hub, was part of a group that paid to erect two billboards along U.S. Route 101 in Silicon Valley inviting residents to “Go North.”

In a survey conducted this month, MaRS found that 17 high-growth companies out of 26 respondents said they have experienced a notable increase in people based in the U.S. applying for positions in Canada so far this year compared with 2016. Shopify, one of the respondents, said it saw a 40% increase over the 2016 average, although it noted it cannot attribute the increase to any specific cause.

“Companies are recognizing that the level of anxiety is becoming a factor in attracting talent,” said Michael Tippett, co-founder of True North, a consulting firm that aids startups looking to open offices in Canada.

"UNITED NATIONS—Iran has arrested a British-Iranian dual citizen who traveled to Tehran from London on an invitation to speak at an academic workshop, according to friends of his family and human-rights organizations.

Abbas Edalat, a professor of computer science and mathematics at Imperial College and a British-Iranian dual citizen, was arrested in Tehran, friends of the family said.

The arrest of Abbas Edalat, a professor of computer science and mathematics at Imperial College in London, comes at a time of particularly tense relations between Iran and the West over the fate of the nuclear deal.

Europe has assumed the role of liaison between Tehran and Washington, appealing simultaneously to U.S. President Donald Trump to remain committed to the nuclear deal and to Iranian officials to negotiate for a broader agreement touching on regional policy and ballistic missiles.

Some Security Council diplomats said interactions with Iran were tense, adding that their priority remained to sail smoothly past the U.S.’s May 12 deadline for recertifying the nuclear deal without a major confrontation over other issues, including dual-national detainees.

“We are urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities following reports of the arrest of a British-Iranian dual national,” the British Foreign Office said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal.

Iran holds nearly a dozen dual and foreign nationals in prison, including two other British citizens, five Americans, one Austrian and one Swede. They have been charged with espionage and threatening national security and sentenced to a decade or more of prison in closed-door trials. A Canadian-Iranian professor and environmentalist, Kavous Seyed Emami, died in prison in February under questionable circumstances, family members said. His wife, Maryam Mombeini, also a Canadian, is banned from leaving Iran.

Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said this week that Iran would be open to negotiating a prisoner swap for dual nationals with the U.S. if Mr. Trump changes his posture, tone and behavior toward Iran. The U.S. has made at least three overtures to Iran since January for prisoner negotiations but hasn’t received a reply, according to U.S. officials and families of American detainees.

“Talk is only possible when there is mutual respect. I said, without mutual respect, a dialogue will get nowhere,” Mr. Zarif said on Monday at a talk in New York.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have arrested 30 Iranian dual nationals since the signing of the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in 2015, according to the Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based group.

“Iran will continue to detain dual nationals and use them as political playing cards until countries with leverage, including the U.K., forcefully demand that Iran cease the practice of hostage-taking once and for all,” said Hadi Ghaemi, the group’s executive director.

Mr. Edalat, an unmarried middle-aged man with sisters in Iran and the U.S., is an accomplished math and computer-science scholar. Earlier this month he won an award from his university for a computer-science paper he had co-written with a colleague.

In Iran, Mr. Edalat has been known for bringing computers from Britain and giving them to Iranian children in need. He is a vocal antiwar and anti-sanctions activist, staging protests, appearing on television as an analyst, and founding a U.S.-based advocacy to promote his views.

“Iran’s nuclear program is completely peaceful,” Mr. Edalat said on CNBC in 2102 denouncing international sanctions against Iran as a pretext for war. “What is in [the West’s] mind is regime change, in the same way they wanted regime change in Iraq.”

Security forces raided Mr. Edalat’s family home in Tehran on April 15 and arrested him, according to friends of the family and human-rights organizations, who said he was taken to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps intelligence wing in Evin prison. They said security forces also confiscated his computer, phone, notebooks and compact discs.

The charges against Mr. Edalat are unknown and he has had no access to a lawyer, friends of the family said. Iranian officials in Iran haven’t commented on Mr. Edalat’s arrest, and Iran’s Mission to the U.N. didn’t respond to a request for comment.

“We are urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities following reports of the arrest of a British-Iranian dual national,” the British Foreign Office said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal.

The Revolutionary Court in Tehran set bail but denied the family’s efforts to post it on April 21, according to human-rights agencies, which said the family made a second unsuccessful attempt to post bail on Wednesday.

“This is terrifying. [Mr. Edalat] has for years been working for the cause of education for all in Iran. There is not a kinder person than him,” Iranian journalist Nazli Kamvari wrote on Twitter.

"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia—Saudi Arabia is temporarily halting all oil shipments going through an important Red Sea waterway, accusing Iran-allied rebels of attacking two crude tankers on Wednesday.

Stopping crude shipments through the Bab el-Mandeb strait—which connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden—marks another escalation in the war between an Arab military coalition and Houthi rebels for control of Yemen. Saudi Arabia is attempting to ramp up oil exports amid an effort to keep the world well-supplied with oil as the U.S. squeezes Riyadh’s rival, Iran, with new sanctions that could reduce its oil exports.

Saudi Arabia said the Houthis attacked two very large crude carriers operated by Saudi National Shipping Corp. in the Red Sea on Wednesday. One of the ships sustained minimal damage. No injuries nor oil spill have been reported, according to an emailed statement from the kingdom.

Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said all oil exports through the southern Red Sea would be halted “until the situation becomes clearer and the maritime transit through Bab el-Mandeb is safe.”

The Saudi-led Arab coalition is locked in a battle for control of Hodeidah, an important port in Yemen where most humanitarian aid reaches the country’s people but, according to the Saudis, also serves as a conduit for arms from Iran. Tehran has denied backing the Houthis.

Naval forces affiliated with the Houthis said they targeted Saudi military vessels, not oil tankers.

“The side that threatens the international security and peace and endangers the security of the Red Sea is Saudi-American-led aggression” said a statement from the Houthi-linked forces.

Yemeni rebels are increasingly targeting Saudi Arabian oil facilities, threatening the kingdom’s economic engine and adding another layer of geopolitical tension that is helping push oil prices to their highest levels since 2014.

The barrage of attacks has edged the three-year conflict with the Houthis uncomfortably close to the core of the Saudi economy, crystallizing the risks to the region’s oil industry. By striking a blow to Saudi wealth, the Houthis hope to inflict disproportionate damage on an enemy that is stronger militarily but hasn’t been able to dislodge the rebels.

Saudi Arabia leads a military coalition at war since 2015 with the Houthis, which they see as proxies of their regional rival, Iran. The Houthis have controlled the capital, San’a, since ousting a Saudi-supported government, and ongoing skirmishes along the two countries’ porous border have kept the coalition engaged in the conflict.

"Rarely has an American president been as isolated on foreign policy as President Trump is today. The Senate voted 97-2 to support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization last week, even as Mr. Trump belittled NATO and its principal members. Meanwhile, both the Justice Department and the director of national intelligence are sounding the alarm about the Russian leader Mr. Trump appears to be trying to recruit as an American ally. The president’s policy of reconciliation with Russia at the expense of NATO has even less support in Washington than President Obama’s policy of breaking with Middle East allies to attempt a reconciliation with Iran.

Among the president’s remarkable assumptions about Vladimir Putin’s Russia: that it can be induced to cooperate with the U.S. on a wide range of security issues, including Syria and Iran; and that it can replace Germany as America’s principal Eurasian partner—or, if not, the U.S. can use the threat of a Russian alliance to extract better terms from Germany and the European Union. The president is confident that he possesses the bargaining ability and diplomatic talent to manage the complex negotiations involved.

Why does Mr. Trump seem so determined to defy his advisers and play a Russia card that costs him dearly in Washington and nourishes the suspicions of the investigators probing his Russia connections? His fiercest critics are sure they know the answer: Vladimir Putin has “compromised” the president, leaving him no choice but to appease the Russian dictator.

Special counsel Robert Mueller will be in a better position to assess that question than the journalists who speculate about it wildly. Meanwhile, after Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, it’s worth remembering that his Russia policy is less of an outlier than some of his critics assume. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama also naively overestimated their ability to charm Mr. Putin.

Mr. Obama’s policy in particular bore similarities to Mr. Trump’s. Both men held Washington’s foreign-policy establishment (“the blob” or “the deep state”) in contempt. Both came to the job with a belief that their unique life stories and personal qualities would enable them to transform global politics in a historic way. Both were willing to accept a Russian presence in Syria and to overlook Russian complicity in Bashar Assad’s atrocities. Long after the 2009 “reset” failed, Mr. Obama was willing to flout domestic public opinion to make concessions to Russia. As he whispered to Russia’s then-President Dmitry Medvedev in 2012: “This is my last election. . . . After my election I have more flexibility,” on issues like missile defense.

While the press celebrated rather than pilloried him for it, Mr. Obama also made overtures to a U.S. adversary (Iran) over the heads of longtime allies (Israel and the Gulf states). Mr. Trump’s Russia overtures over Germany’s head are just as ill-considered.

What differentiates Mr. Trump from Mr. Obama most sharply is his approach to Europe. Mr. Obama saw Europe as a rich and generally well-intentioned part of the world that punches well below its weight in world affairs. Mr. Trump’s view has been profoundly influenced by hard-core Brexiteers like Nigel Farage and anti-Islamist campaigners who see in the EU a mix of fecklessness in defending Western values and ruthlessness in promoting its own bureaucratic power.

Similarly, both Mr. Trump and the Brexiteers see the EU as a screen for German domination of the Continent. And Mr. Trump’s concern that “excessive” levels of migrants from Islamic countries threaten the social cohesion of Western societies tallies with the views of politicians in countries across Europe who resent German power and fear the imposition of post-Christian, postnationalist values through the EU.

From this perspective, Mr. Putin looks less like a malign force bent on dismantling the cathedral of liberty and more like an unsavory but potentially useful partner. After all, the one indisputable success of the EU is forming a bloc that can collectively resist American pressure on trade. Mr. Trump sees the trade balance as a fundamental inequity in the trans-Atlantic relationship. From this mercantilist perspective, cooperating with Mr. Putin’s anti-EU agenda is appealing to the president.

A fresh start with Russia appears to be as much of an idée fixe for Mr. Trump as outreach to Iran was for his predecessor. Mr. Obama never fully appreciated that the U.S. political system limits the ability of presidents to bring about diplomatic revolutions in the teeth of congressional resistance. It remains to be seen whether and how quickly Mr. Trump will grasp this important truth.",world

"Mexico isn’t paying for that border wall, but Canada has volunteered to single-handedly finance a bridge to facilitate trade with the United States. Supporting this deal should be easy for the Trump Administration, but a family special interest has launched a last-ditch lobbying effort to persuade President Trump to block this shovel-ready, multibillion-dollar project.

Canada is the largest export market for American goods, and more than one-fourth of all goods exchanged traverse the Detroit River connecting Detroit and Windsor, Canada. There are only a few ways across: the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, which is too low for almost all commercial trucks; the rail and barge system, which is devoted to oversized or hazardous goods; and the privately owned Ambassador Bridge that holds a virtual monopoly on cross-border truck traffic.

Built in 1929, the bridge is two years younger than its longtime owner, Detroit billionaire Matty Moroun. In 2015 large chunks of concrete began falling from the bridge onto Windsor streets. The bridge has four operational lanes on a good day, not nearly enough for the 2.5 million trucks that traversed it last year.

There’s no direct connection from the bridge to Canadian freeways, and multiple stoplights gum up the bridge’s entrances in Windsor. Traffic is often snarled on both sides of the border. Time is money, and delays in border crossings are expected to cost Americans $15 billion annually by 2020, the nonprofit Canada West Foundation concluded in 2017.

Enter the long-planned Gordie Howe International Bridge, slated for construction two miles west of the Ambassador Bridge. Though American exporters and trucks will use the new bridge, Canada has agreed to finance the entire project, including labor, construction and property acquisitions. Gordie Howe will connect directly to U.S. Interstate 75 and Canadian Highway 401, relieving the traffic misery. Michigan gets joint ownership of the finished bridge.

But the Moroun family wants to maintain its chokehold on cross-border traffic and an estimated $60 million in annual tolls. They’ve suggested building their own new bridge, and they’ve fought tooth and nail against Gordie Howe. But their 2012 ballot measure failed to persuade Michigan voters, and some two dozen lawsuits have failed.

Gordie Howe is scheduled to break ceremonial ground in Detroit this week, with construction beginning in the fall. But the Morouns haven’t given up. In an ad on “Fox & Friends” on Fox News last month, they appealed directly to Mr. Trump to revoke a key permit approved by the State Department in 2013. One ad claimed the Obama Administration granted a waiver “so the new bridge wouldn’t have to use American steel.” It also suggests that the bridge favors Canadian workers over Americans.

Mr. Trump should see through this obvious con. Ottawa is picking up the whole tab, so it’s reasonable to reject a prohibition on Canadian steel and iron. But all metals used on the bridge will be North American, including some from the 48 states. The crossing agreement for Gordie Howe explicitly states that there “shall be no discrimination . . . in favour of Canada over the US with respect to any products, materials, supplies, labour or services.”

Several hundred Americans are doing preparatory work in Detroit, and Canada has brought some Michiganders to help in Windsor. Canada is offering the United States the deal of the century. Apparently the Morouns think Mr. Trump can be suckered out of it.",world

"The German government never had so much money or so many ideas about how to spend it. The one thing that isn’t being discussed is giving it back to taxpayers.

Tax cuts—a fixture of the political debate in the U.S., where the government hasn’t balanced its books in decades—are barely on the agenda here, even though Germany’s next government is expected to post a consolidated budget surplus of roughly €50 billion ($62 billion) between now and 2021, according to finance ministry calculations.

“It is sort of a through-the-looking-glass world,” said John Kornblum, a former U.S. ambassador to Germany, of the two countries’ differing attitudes. “Traditionally Germans have been in favor of hoarding resources rather than lowering government expenditures.”

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s new government, set to come into office next month if her coalition partner approves the alliance, will be no exception. Its 177-page policy platform includes only one small tax cut worth €10 billion over four years and limited to low earners, next to nearly €50 billion of spending on child care, education, infrastructure and welfare benefits.

Despite the state’s overflowing coffers, Ms. Merkel’s conservatives had to talk their left-leaning partners out of raising taxes during the tense negotiations over the coalition agreement.

The aversion to discussing tax cuts on business profits and personal income is surprising, many economists argue, because Germany—despite its cultivated self-image as a stronghold of fiscal rectitude—has among the highest taxes in the world and a habit of heavy state spending.

The tax wedge—the share of wages that workers and businesses pay in tax and other mandatory levies—is 49.4%, second only to Belgium among the 35 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Total government spending, meanwhile, has risen around 10% since 2014. At 45% of gross domestic product, it is 9 percentage points higher than in the U.S.

‘ You need high taxes in order to be civilized. ’ —Sven Giegold of the Green Party

Lower corporate and income taxes could lead to higher spending and investment, boost imports and lower the nation’s giant trade surplus, economists say. That would please trading partners such as the U.S. which have chafed at Germany’s record run of current-account surpluses—a measure of excess savings in the economy.

“It would be better for [Germany’s] long-term growth prospects if the tax system were less heavy on labor,” said Andrés Fuentes, an economist with the OECD in Paris.

Yet the perception of tax cuts in the country’s political mainstream ranges from slightly shameful to outright evil. Many conservatives see them as overindulgent toward voters, while the center-left views them as morally indefensible gifts to the rich. All parties, with the exception of the pro-business Free Democrats, favor a high degree of redistribution.

“You need high taxes in order to be civilized,” said Sven Giegold, who represents Germany’s Green Party in the European Parliament. “We are very far away from the government having too much money.” The federal audit office, meanwhile, has expressed concerns about the fiscal challenges of providing for an aging population and infrastructure investment.

Only one-fifth of Germans think the federal surplus is reason to cut tax, according to a poll in July by Infratest Dimap. More than half said the government should spend the money on investments, and another fifth wanted to pay down the national debt faster.

Germany’s gross national debt amounted to 65% of GDP last year, compared with 97% for France, 108% for the U.S. and 240% for Japan, according to the IMF. The national debt is expected to fall to 50% of GDP in Germany by 2022, while that in the other countries is expected to drift down very slowly or—in the case of the U.S.—to rise.

Yet even the German Taxpayers’ Association has said the focus should be on repaying debt, though it has called for some limited tax cuts.

The stigma around tax cuts means not just the federal government, but also towns small and big up and down the country are awash in money—and not always sure what to do with it.

In Eschborn, a town of 22,000 near Frankfurt with €212 million in its coffers, Mayor Mathias Geiger recently proposed to local officials a tax cut for businesses. The town council rejected it. The urge to save, Mr. Geiger observed philosophically, is anchored “deep in the German soul.”

To be sure, taxes in Germany, as in other European countries, cover a range of highly popular social benefits, including universal health care and state pensions. The last time income-tax rates dropped in a big way was under Ms. Merkel’s predecessor, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who cut taxes in the early 2000s in a bid to boost a then-stagnant economy. Most individual income over €54,000 is effectively taxed at about 44% for single taxpayers, with a surtax on earnings over €256,000.

Germany’s corporate tax rate has fallen to around 30% from more than 55% in the late 1990s. But that level will soon be the highest among the Group of 7 major economies, potentially putting German companies at a disadvantage in international markets.

The growth rate of Germany’s capital stock is falling behind that of the U.S. and France, and even lagging behind Italy’s by some measures, says Guntram Wolff, director of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. Incentivizing corporate investment should be a priority for the next government, he said.

Corporate-tax cuts are deeply unpopular, however. “The social discourse is, if you cut corporate-tax rates further, it’s basically a race to the bottom,” Mr. Wolff said.

EBM Papst, a manufacturer of electric motors in the southern German region of Baden-Württemberg, plans to take advantage of lower U.S. taxes to expand its North American footprint. But because of taxes at home, its chief executive, Stefan Brandl, worries about being at a disadvantage to his American competitors.

“A new German government should see it as important to support firms and not burden them with bureaucracy that weakens the competitive situation,” Mr. Brandl said.

Andreas Povel, a former general manager of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany, says German politicians “are in an extraordinary comfort zone” that blinds them from the need to keep state spending in check. German firms are likely to invest more in the U.S. to take advantage of the recent corporate-tax cut there rather than at home, Mr. Povel said.

Back in Eschborn, work is about to start on a new building for emergency services, a sport hall, a youth center, and an expansion of the public swimming pool. An expansion of the town hall and a new convention center will have to wait until staff can process them.

“We don’t have many millionaires here, but the town itself is a millionaire,” said Mr. Geiger.

"Erivan Haub, born into the family that owns the German retailer Tengelmann Group, grew up reading novels about America’s Wild West. In 1951, when he was 19, he finally got to see it. The family sent him to Chicago and California to work at supermarkets and see what he could learn from them.

“In America, you feel immediately free,” he later said.

Mr. Haub became chief executive of Tengelmann in 1969 and a decade later implanted the company deeply into the U.S. by acquiring a controlling stake in Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., operator of the A&P grocery chain, by then long past its prime. Mr. Haub and his son Christian spent more than two decades struggling to revive the chain. They couldn’t stop its slide toward a liquidation that has played out over the past few years.

Mr. Haub left his stamp on America in other ways. He and his wife, Helga, donated a collection of art from the American West, including works by Frederic Remington and Georgia O’Keeffe, to the Tacoma Art Museum, along with $20 million for a new wing to display them.

The Haubs also funded the preservation of a former home of George C. Marshall, who as Secretary of State led a U.S.-financed drive to rebuild Europe after World War II. They made major donations to several universities.

In his later years, Mr. Haub worked on his stamp collection and oversaw a herd of bison at his ranch near Pinedale, Wyo. He died there March 6. He was 85 and had recently celebrated his 60th wedding anniversary.

Tengelmann, the family company, has always made most of its money in Europe. In recent years, it has shed supermarkets and concentrated on home-improvement and discount-fashion stores. A factory that made Black Forest Gummy Bears was sold more than a decade ago.

The once-glamorous world of retailing kept getting grimmer. In 1992, Mr. Haub was ranked by Forbes as the world’s seventh richest person, a notch ahead of Bill Gates. The magazine now estimates the family fortune at $6.4 billion, ranking them No. 265 on the global list.

Erivan Karl Matthias Haub, an only child and fourth-generation member of Tengelmann’s founding family, was born Sept. 29, 1932, in Wiesbaden, Germany. After his apprenticeship at American supermarkets, he spent six months in Cuba, where he sold imported toys and watches.

Back in Germany, he earned an economics degree at the University of Mainz and met his future wife, Helga. He took her on a tour of the Pacific Northwest, which reminded her of the Black Forest. They bought a waterfront home near Tacoma, Wash., where their three sons were born.

Once he became CEO in 1969, “I was really hungry to grow,” he recalled in an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer. He expanded the company rapidly by acquiring grocery chains in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands.

When he bought control of A&P in 1979—initially with a 42% stake and later raised above 50%—it was a leap into the unknown. “I had never seen its headquarters, I had never seen its balance sheet,” he told the Inquirer. “Only based on the name of that one great company, I believed there were hidden assets there.”

There were also hidden traps. Within a year, amid continuing losses, Mr. Haub told reporters he had underestimated A&P’s problems, including high costs and poor locations. Mr. Haub’s team persuaded A&P to set up a new chain of no-frills grocery stores under the Plus brand, but they bombed.

The German owners brought in a British CEO, James Wood, who closed hundreds of underperforming A&P stores and acquired other chains. For a few years in the mid-1980s, Mr. Haub heralded a turnaround. But A&P lagged far behind the bigger U.S. supermarket chains in the 1990s.

In 1998, Mr. Haub’s son Christian, who was 33, became CEO of A&P. Among other things, he promoted a new slogan, “We’re fresh obsessed.” Touting crisp celery failed to end the slow-motion collapse.

Founded as a New York tea and coffee store in 1859, A&P later helped invent the supermarket and was long the largest retailer in the U.S. In the 1930s, it had nearly 16,000 stores across the U.S. John Updike wrote a short story about an A&P checkout boy who quits his job after his boss scolds teenage girls for shopping in their bathing suits. By the time Mr. Haub arrived, A&P was rapidly shrinking.

In recent decades, A&P was up against aggressive competitors like ShopRite in the New York area, said Jim Hertel, a food-retailing expert at Inmar Analytics. A&P couldn’t generate enough cash to update its smallish stores.

Mr. Haub is survived by his wife, three sons and nine grandchildren.

Always publicity-shy, he stayed almost completely out of the public view in his later years but he did show up in November 2014 for the opening of the new wing of the Tacoma Art Museum featuring his collection. From a wheelchair, he said: “I’m happy with it—very happy.” On the menu for the opening party was a dish dubbed “Bison Bolognese.” Looking on were his three sons, wearing cowboy hats.",world
"Mercedes-Benz, the luxury unit of Daimler AG , recently learned the price of crossing Beijing. Earlier this month the German car maker was attacked by state media after posting an anodyne Dalai Lama quote on Instagram. The company quickly and abjectly apologized to the Chinese government. It then went further, promising “no support, assistance, aid or help to anyone who intentionally subverts or attempts to subvert China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

This public humiliation has prompted many companies to ask: How much is it worth to stay in China’s markets?

Gone are the days when China bided its time, as counseled by Deng Xiaoping. In exchange for continued access to Chinese markets, Beijing increasingly expects Western companies to engage in self-censorship, accept government control over information, and even punish their own workers for offending China.

Few companies have been willing to stand up for themselves when singled out. In January the American hotel giant Marriott caved in to pressure and temporarily shut down its websites in China. Its offense? An online questionnaire listed Tibet, Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong as independent countries. After changing the website, the company’s CEO publicly stated that Marriott “respects and supports Chinese sovereignty and its territorial integrity.” Delta Air Lines , Qantas, Zara and Audi are also fellow travelers in China’s geopolitical strategy.

Perhaps most concerning, China has taken a particular interest in changing the fundamental way Western technology companies function. Facebook , banned in China since 2009, has worked on a “targeted censorship” tool during its bid to re-enter the country. Apple recently agreed to a partnership with a Chinese internet service company after new laws required it, and Apple said it will move Chinese user data from the U.S. to China. Apple says it will comply with legally valid requests for user data from the Chinese government when it has access to the data, as it does in the U.S.

﻿ ﻿ Some Western corporate leaders argue that running away from China makes no sense. “We believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said last year. But engagement is a two-way street, and Beijing has shown no willingness to accommodate. Instead it has become more intrusive.

China’s behavior makes it necessary for Western companies to ask whether the cost of doing business can be too high. Does the profit motive override any responsibility to defend the values of the societies from which they emerged? If only to draw the line against further demands, companies should be reflexively opposed to Beijing’s overreach. Otherwise they should expect the cost of doing business in China to continue to rise.

RAMALLAH, West Bank—Palestinians angry over their dysfunctional government and decrepit infrastructure are souring on Mahmoud Abbas, as the U.S. questions the 83-year-old leader’s interest in peace talks with Israel.

Protests, once rare, have broken out in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, which Mr. Abbas heads as president. Demonstrators last month clashed with security forces.

More than 60% of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza want Mr. Abbas to resign, according to a public-opinion poll released Wednesday by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research.

Still, 64% of Palestinians say they worry that if Mr. ​Abbas leaves politics, it could spark turmoil and insecurity because he has no clear successor.

The president is now in the 13th year of what initially was meant to be a four-year term and has been in and out of the hospital in recent months. He shows no signs of relinquishing power.

A spokesman for Mr. Abbas didn’t respond to questions about criticism of his leadership. Aides defended Mr. Abbas as an important figure who has helped shape Palestinian institutions.

But some acknowledged that progress toward a deal with Israel and improvements in daily life haven’t come fast enough.

“We have never reached this level of weakness in front of our people,” said Saeb Erekat, a 63-year-old top aide to Mr. Abbas.

“At the end of the day, governing is not about how decent you are and how honest you are,” Mr. Erekat said. “You promised your people you do something. You didn’t.”

Crumbling public services have generated frustration. Mounds of garbage piled up on the streets of Ramallah last month during a strike by sanitation workers. At the Palestine Medical Complex in the city, patients complain about poorly trained medical personnel and inadequate equipment.

“You can’t give security all the budget and leave the patient with nothing,” said Atef​Abu Qubita, 47, who was getting treatment for diabetes.

Mr. Abbas’s fragile position is adding to skepticism about the success of any peace plan advanced by the Trump administration.

Washington has described Mr. Abbas as a potential spoiler. Palestinian officials have boycotted the Trump administration since its December announcement it was moving the U.S. embassy to the contested city of Jerusalem.

In a recent interview with a Palestinian newspaper, Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, criticized Mr. Abbas, saying: “There are a lot of sharp statements and condemnations, but no ideas or efforts with prospects of success.”

In response, Abbas spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh said the Palestinian leader “cannot be bypassed, neither regionally nor internationally.”

The territories of the West Bank, governed by the Palestinian Authority, and the Gaza Strip, run by Hamas, are divided. Ordinary Palestinians are frustrated with the failure of the government to deliver basic services amid high poverty and unemployment.

“Unfortunately, our experience with democracy was a big failure,” said Qassam Barghouti, who works in public relations. Palestinian leaders have failed to make “space for young people and for women to be well-represented in the decision-making circles in the country.”

Mr. Barghouti is the son of Marwan Barghouti, a politician viewed as a possible successor to Mr. Abbas who is now in prison in Israel after being convicted on murder charges in connection with a Palestinian uprising known as the Second Intifada.

Officials say time isn’t on their side and that they fear more radical leaders, backed by restless young people, could end up in charge.

About 70% of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are 29 and younger, according to the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics. Those who run the Palestinian Authority are in their 60s, 70s and 80s.

Under the 1993 Oslo Accords that set the terms for relations between Israel and the Palestinians, the Palestinian Authority was meant to be an interim government until a sovereign state could be established. Palestinian officials say they have been unable to hold elections while the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are divided.

A recent reconciliation effort has stalled, as Hamas, which controls Gaza, has refused to dissolve its armed wing. There are also financial disagreements.

Palestinians have directed fresh ire at Mr. Abbas because he has slashed government salaries in the Gaza Strip, a move also deeply unpopular in the West Bank.

The Palestinian Authority controlled the Gaza Strip until 2007, and had continued to pay its employees there even after Hamas took control. Mr. Abbas hoped the cuts would pressure Hamas in a stalled reconciliation process, but the hardship has deepened.

Last month, security forces broke up a demonstration in Ramallah over the cuts, and a protest several days earlier drew 2,000 people.

Fadi Quran, 30, one of the organizers, said activists limited the focus to Mr. Abbas’s Gaza policy rather than calling for his resignation, since many aren’t ready to cross that line.

“People don’t have a vision of what happens next,” he said.

"Before I could begin my question to President Trump at Wednesday’s press conference, he asked me where I was from. I told him I was a Kurd from Iraq; he said: “I like this question so far.”

Naturally, I went on to ask about the Kurds, who have provided boots on the ground in the fight against Islamic State. “We have defeated ISIS, essentially,” Mr. Trump told me, “And we did it with a lot of help from the Kurds. And they are great fighters.”

Then Mr. Trump took a question from Rahimi Rashidi of Kurdistan TV, whom he addressed as “Mr. Kurd.” Cue the social-media outrage.

Neither Mr. Rashidi nor I was offended by the nickname. I tweeted: “I’m proud to be a Kurd. I actually take it as a compliment if you call me Mr. Kurd.” I have received hundreds of messages from Americans apologizing for Mr. Trump. Soon #MrKurd started trending on Twitter .

This was great news for the Kurds. For a moment, all of America seemed to be talking about the Kurds, a stateless people of 40 million, who have long been oppressed in the Middle East and ignored abroad. Our very existence was denied until about three decades ago. For nearly a century, we wished our governments would call us Kurds—not Arabs, Persians or “mountainous Turks.” We were subjected to genocide and chemical gas merely for being Kurdish.

What might have offended many Kurds was Mr. Trump’s shallow characterization of our people, echoing that of politicians before him. He called Kurds “great fighters.” Most Western officials who praise Kurds talk about our fighting skills as if we are no more than mercenaries or security contractors.

Kurds have been in the region for thousands of years. Kurdistan is home to Erbil, one of the oldest continuously inhabited places on earth. We have contributed to civilization. We are a tolerant, secular nation where multiple religious groups including Christians and Yazidis continue to live together in peace.

It is true that Kurds have been America’s most effective partner in the fight against ISIS. And in 2003 we fought side-by-side with the U.S. to topple Saddam Hussein. While thousands of Americans were killed in the rest of Iraq, no American soldier has been killed in Kurdistan in the Iraq war.

Our single biggest problem is that we don’t have a state of our own. Our people continue to be oppressed and persecuted. But when asking for our political rights, nobody, not even the U.S. or Mr. Trump, seems to be on our side. Our historical land of Kurdistan is divided among four hostile countries, Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria. Why should Arabs, Turks, Persians and other nations enjoy independence but not the Kurds?

So thank you, Mr. President, for calling us “Mr. Kurd.” No offense was taken. But please know that we are more than just “great fighters.” We hope that you will start taking real steps toward securing the rights of our pro-American, peace-loving people in the Middle East. The first place to start is in preventing Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria from attacking us while you depend on our soldiers to fight ISIS.

"Miners are considering new ways to make the dirt they dig up green.

Across the U.S. border in Quebec, a research facility will fine-tune a technology that its owners— Alcoa Corp. AA 3.20% and Rio Tinto RIO 0.21% PLC—believe could turn aluminum smelters carbon-free for the first time. Another initiative under way in Sweden could see hydrogen replace coking coal in manufacturing steel.

Miners have long seen investing in technology as a way to bring costs down and protect profits during swings in the global economy. But a new force for change has recently emerged: customers such as Apple Inc. and Audi AG that see a marketing advantage in ensuring their products are cleaner and greener than before.

Nestlé SA’s coffee brand Nespresso, for example, wants to source all the aluminum for its capsules from sustainably managed operations by 2020, which includes strict limits on greenhouse-gas emissions. Audi introduced sustainability ratings for suppliers a year ago and said that was becoming just as important in determining its purchases as cost and quality.

“You want your green iPhone, not your brown iPhone,” said John O’Brien, a clean-technology specialist at Deloitte in Australia.

Alcoa had spent nearly a decade at a site near Pittsburgh testing technology that would release oxygen instead of carbon dioxide during the smelting process when it was approached by Apple. Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple liked the technology’s potential but worried how long it would take to become commercially viable.

In the Air Metals makers hope a new technology will more quickly clean up the energy-hungry aluminum industry. Energy intensity of primary aluminum production China North America Global 20 thousand kilowatt-hours per metric ton Global average 15 10 5 0 2000 ’10 Global direct CO2 industrial emissions Iron and steel 27% Cement 27% Aluminum 3% Chemicals and petrochemicals 14% Others 29%

“An iMac has more than half a pound of aluminum in it, so they are really interested in supporting advancement of technologies that allow them to reduce the footprint of their product,” said Vincent Christ, chief executive of the Rio Tinto and Alcoa joint venture, called Elysis.

Sarah Chandler, Apple’s senior director of operations and environmental initiatives, said, “We wholeheartedly reject the notion that you can’t protect the environment while protecting your bottom line.”

For Rio Tinto and Alcoa, it wasn’t just about satisfying a big customer. Innovations like electric vehicles and batteries to power homes are deepening markets for a basket of long-ignored commodities such as cobalt. As a result, global mining companies want to shore up demand for the metals and minerals that have long generated the bulk of their profits.

Manufacturing iron, steel and aluminum can be heavily polluting. Together, these sectors account for a combined 30% of direct industrial carbon-dioxide emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.

Producers want to ensure their metals don’t get substituted for cleaner alternatives or become exposed to carbon taxes. In the U.S., a group of veteran conservative political leaders recently established a political-action committee to amplify calls for a levy on emissions.

Mr. Christ said low- or no-carbon metal likely can be sold at premium prices, while the technology has the potential to lower costs and lift production each by 15%. The venture aims to begin selling the technology in roughly five years.

Consumer-goods companies concede they were caught off guard by the strength of feeling among their customers about which commodities they use, and in what amounts.

Nespresso had focused on promoting how it sources its coffee when it realized customers were fixated on the packaging, said Daniel Weston, who leads the unit’s legal and corporate-affairs team. He also is the chair of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative, an organization that has been set up to certify aluminum that meets certain environmental, social and governance standards. In April, Rio Tinto became the first company to be certified.

Critics say the mining industry has been slow to embrace change. Rio Tinto and Alcoa’s Elysis technology, if commercialized, will be the first significant shift in the way aluminum is made in more than a century.

In the Swedish city of Luleå, steelmaker SSAB AB, iron-ore miner Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB and power-generator Vattenfall AB are jointly building a pilot steel factory that will use hydrogen in place of coking coal. They expect the facility to start testing their Hybrit technology in 2020, with a goal of producing fossil-free steel by 2035, SSAB said.

Sweden wants to become a net-zero emissions country in 2045, “so that makes the need for developing a breakthrough technology even more relevant,” said SSAB Chief Technology Officer Martin Pei.

Other technologies on trial globally include a system in China that pares steelmaking emissions while turning waste into a sellable material used to make cement.

Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, or CSIRO, has spent a decade developing a supersonic nozzle to make magnesium metal with 70% fewer carbon-dioxide-equivalent emissions. It is racing to adapt it for lithium, an in-demand commodity used in electric vehicles.

While the developers of the Elysis and Hybrit technologies hope to revolutionize the steel and aluminum industries, CSIRO mineral-resources director Jonathan Law said researchers have largely focused on technologies that can “bolt on and have a big impact quickly.”",world

"ROME—The Vatican said it would soon respond with clarifications to charges Pope Francis covered up sexual misconduct by a favorite U.S. cardinal—claims that have provoked the biggest scandal of the current pontificate.

The pope’s advisory Council of Cardinals on Monday expressed “full solidarity with Pope Francis in the face of what has happened in the last weeks, mindful that amid the current debate the Holy See is about to formulate any necessary clarifications.”

For more than two weeks, the pope and the Vatican have declined to answer accusations by Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, a former Vatican ambassador to the U.S. The archbishop claimed he told Pope Francis in 2013 that then-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, a former archbishop of Washington, had been privately disciplined by Pope Benedict XVI for being sexually active with seminarians. In spite of this information, the archbishop said, Pope Francis made the retired cardinal a powerful adviser on Vatican foreign policy and the appointment of U.S. bishops.

“I won’t say a word about it,” the pope told reporters on Aug. 26, the day after the allegations were published, and other Vatican officials have followed suit. But more than 25 U.S. bishops, including Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, have publicly called for an investigation of Archbishop Viganò’s allegations.

Cardinal DiNardo has also requested a Vatican investigation to explain former-Cardinal McCarrick’s rise to power, despite widespread reports of his sexual activity with seminarians and young priests.

In July, Archbishop McCarrick became the first man to resign from the College of Cardinals in nearly a century, after a church investigation found credible a charge that he had sexually abused a teenager in the early 1970s. He is facing a church trial that could end in his dismissal from the priesthood. Archbishop McCarrick has said he doesn’t remember the incident with the teenager. His lawyer has said he deserves due process with regard to Archbishop Viganò’s allegations.

Related Video Pope Francis said he was ashamed that the Catholic church had failed to adequately address clergy sexual abuse. He made the comments during the first papal visit to Ireland in nearly 40 years.

A document published on Friday by Catholic News Service, an agency of the U.S. bishops, suggested Vatican officials knew in 2000—before Archbishop McCarrick’s installation in Washington and his elevation to cardinal—about allegations of sexual activity with seminarians. The 2006 letter from a top Vatican official referred to unspecified “serious matters” involving seminarians that the Rev. Boniface Ramsey, a priest in New York, had raised with a Vatican envoy six years earlier. The letter doesn’t mention then-Cardinal McCarrick, but Father Ramsey has said he put his accusations against Archbishop McCarrick in a letter to the envoy in 2000.

The McCarrick and Viganò affairs are only two of the most recent incidents in the church’s sexual-abuse crisis, which has also affected the nine-man Council of Cardinals. One of its members, Australian Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican’s finance chief, is facing charges of sexual abuse in his home country. Another member, Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz Ossa, has been accused of covering up sexual abuse. Both cardinals have denied wrongdoing.

Critics have protested both cardinals’ continued presence on the council. Members of the council don’t have set terms of office or retirement ages, but Monday’s statement seemed to set the stage for turnover, noting that the body had asked the pope to reflect on its composition, “taking into account the advanced age of some members.”

Cardinal Errázuriz, 85 years old, is the council’s oldest member, while Cardinal Pell, 77, is the third-oldest.

"SHANGHAI—A son of the U.S. ambassador to Beijing used his connections to President Donald Trump this week to drum up business for his public-relations firm.

Eric Branstad, a son of Ambassador Terry Branstad, and the U.S. Commerce Department’s liaison to the White House until January, spoke on Thursday in Shanghai to more than 100 lawyers, bankers and advisers at a seminar titled “How to React To (Potential) US-China Trade War?”

Mr. Branstad highlighted his personal relationship with Mr. Trump and plans for his firm to open a China office, attendees said.

It isn’t unusual for former U.S. government officials to visit China, dangling the keys to understanding Washington, and ethics rules don’t appear to bar Mr. Branstad from doing so. But such a move could raise the appearance of ethical conflicts, experts say.

Mr. Trump is upending longstanding U.S.-China ties that he has criticized as cozy and harmful to American interests. His administration imposed tariffs on Chinese goods that are set to begin on July 6; Beijing says it will retaliate.

Mr. Branstad endorsed Mr. Trump’s challenges to China while onstage with a colleague, but his efforts to build his own business in the country appeared to hinge on his personal connection to the Republican president, the attendees said.

“It was this whole splash about how they met Donald Trump,” said Richard Chenel, a Shanghai-based private-equity investor who attended the presentation. Mr. Chenel said he had hoped to gain insight about how trade tensions might affect investment valuations. He said he was disappointed that Mr. Branstad’s primary message was that Mr. Trump supports the American worker.

The U.S. Embassy in Beijing declined comment. The White House didn’t immediately respond. Reached by email, Mr. Branstad declined to comment.

In his travels to Shanghai and Beijing this week, Mr. Branstad was representing Mercury Public Affairs LLC, a Washington communications firm he joined in February as managing director weeks after leaving U.S. government service. At his presentation, Mr. Branstad said Mercury plans to soon open an office in China, attendees said.

In an emailed statement, Mercury partner Michael McKeon said: “Eric Branstad is an accomplished person in his own right, playing a prominent role in the Iowa business and political communities for many years before serving in a high level role in the Department of Commerce.”

“He is well versed in the ethical obligations he has as a former member of the Trump administration and has been scrupulous in adhering to the high standards he sets for himself,” Mr. McKeon added.

Mercury, a division of Omnicom Group Inc., recently began representing a Chinese telecommunications equipment maker that has been in the crosshairs of the U.S. government: ZTE Corp.

On May 13, Mr. Trump set in motion a reversal of a Commerce Department prohibition on ZTE’s access to U.S. suppliers because of allegations the company broke U.S. law. Mr. Trump in a tweet cited a determination to work with Chinese President Xi Jinping to get ZTE “back in business, fast.”

Mercury subsequently said in a filing with the U.S. Justice Department that as of May 14 it would act as a subcontractor to the global law firm Hogan Lovells on matters involving ZTE at a rate of $75,000 a month for three months.

In June, the U.S. Senate voted to reinstate the ZTE ban.

Hogan Lovells declined to comment.

Scott D. Williams, a Shanghai investment broker and co-founder of the organization that sponsored Mr. Branstad’s presentation, said the event was intended to provide insight on the Trump administration’s China policy. The U.S. strategy has left businesspeople wondering whether tensions between Washington and Beijing will become a full-blown trade war.

Eric Branstad was an early fundraiser for Mr. Trump. He joined the administration as it began raising pressure on China. His father was a long-serving Iowa governor who first met China’s president, Mr. Xi, in 1985.

An earlier attempt by the family of a Trump administration official to promote business in China backfired.

When family members of Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, visited Beijing and Shanghai in May 2017 offering chances to earn a U.S. visa by investing in New Jersey apartments that family-owned Kushner Cos. was developing the political backlash was swift.

The company later issued an apology for any suggestion it was benefiting from ties to the White House, and to cancel the participation of Mr. Kushner’s sister during the final leg of the China fundraising tour.

Mr. Branstad’s actions didn’t violate any ethics rules unless his father encouraged him to tout his ties to the U.S. government, said Walt Shaub, former director of the Office of Government Ethics. But Mr. Shaub suggested the event didn’t look good.

“The culture of the federal government has always been that if you’re in a sensitive post like ambassador, particularly for a country as important to our national interest as China, you would strongly discourage your family members from going there for business purposes,” Mr. Shaub said.

In an invitation to the Shanghai event, Mr. Branstad’s bio suggests in both English and Chinese that he continues to have a role with the U.S. government. It describes him as “the main point of contact and chief aid” to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. The Commerce Department didn’t respond to a request to comment. The bio also says “he works as a partner and senior adviser directly with” the secretary and other officials.

Eric Branstad's LinkedIn profile shows him standing between President Donald Trump and his father Terry Branstad, the current U.S. ambassador to China.

Mr. Branstad, whose LinkedIn profile includes a photo of him squeezed in between Mr. Trump and his father, the ambassador, described at the Shanghai event how he and Mr. Trump had bonded over a discussion about tennis, attendees said.

Two organizations listed on an invitation for Mr. Branstad’s appearance distanced themselves from the event.

Organizers distributed the American Chamber of Commerce’s address as the event’s venue. But the chamber said it never agreed to host the talk. Organizers changed the address to an adjacent hotel.

Meanwhile, the logo of law firm Davis Wright Tremaine LLC appeared on the invitation. The firm’s partner in charge, Ron Cai, said he had been asked to underwrite the event but declined. “I told the event organizer we were not interested in sponsoring. I personally have no interest in politics or government-relations work.”

Mr. Williams, the event sponsor, said the free-by-invitation but off-the-record event was planned on short notice after his organization learned Mr. Branstad would be in China.

When the kingdom expelled Canada’s ambassador earlier this week, it also ordered the roughly 7,000 Saudi students and their accompanying family members to leave Canada, one of a series of punitive measures Riyadh unveiled in retaliation for Ottawa’s criticism of its human-rights record.

"GANGNEUNG, South Korea—President Moon Jae-in said he would host a luncheon for a visiting North Korean delegation that includes the sister of leader Kim Jong Un, as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence arrived on the peninsula vowing to ramp up pressure on Pyongyang.

The high-level Korean discussions to be held on Saturday would be the first between the rival nations on South Korean soil, and the first between a South Korean president and a member of the Kim family since 2007.

The North’s nominal head of state will also attend the lunch, which builds on the two sides’ rapprochement ahead of the Winter Olympics that open on Friday in the ski resort of Pyeongchang—even as the U.S. seeks to isolate North Korea’s leaders, whom Mr. Pence called “tyrants” in public remarks Thursday. Kim Yo Jong, a confidante to her brother, North Korean leader Mr. Kim, will arrive at South Korea’s main international airport Friday afternoon and attend the Olympics’ opening ceremony, Seoul’s government said.

Recent comments from Mr. Pence and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, along with news of the attendance by Mr. Kim’s sister, fueled speculation that the Olympics could be a venue for high-level contact between North Korean and U.S. officials. But a North Korean statement early Thursday said it had “no intention to meet with the U.S. side during the stay in South Korea.”

Mr. Pence landed in South Korea and met with Mr. Moon on Thursday, emphasizing the importance of discussing the two sides’ “shared objective of the denuclearization of North Korea.”

The two leaders agreed to a policy of maximum pressure on North Korea to induce the North to engage in denuclearization talks, according to Seoul’s presidential Blue House.

Mr. Pence has raised doubts about North Korea’s intentions in participating in the Olympics and has urged the world not to be fooled by what he described as Pyongyang’s propaganda effort.

The two Koreas will march together at the Games’ opening ceremony on Friday. North Korea’s 140-member propaganda band, the Samjiyon Orchestra, performed Thursday before a packed auditorium in the seaside city of Gangneung, where the Winter Olympics’ ice events will be held.

The band played a number of North Korean pop songs including “Glad to See You,” “Pyongyang Is Best” and “Our Wish Is Unification,” according to North Korea’s state media.

On Wednesday, Mr. Pence had told reporters that Washington intends to further tighten sanctions on Pyongyang, without offering details, and took aim at North Korea’s human-rights record.

Traveling with Mr. Pence is the father of Otto Warmbier, the U.S. college student who was detained in North Korea, suffered a brain injury in custody and died a few days after he was sent home last year. Pyongyang has denied mistreating him.

Speaking at Yokota Air Base in Japan before his arrival in South Korea on Thursday, Mr. Pence made clear the U.S. would continue its campaign of “maximum pressure” in an effort to force North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.

By opening the door to dialogue, Kim Jong Un has turned the world's biggest sporting event into a political weapon. WSJ looks at why the Winter Games are so important to Pyongyang.

“North Korea’s tyrants have never been content to merely subjugate their own people,” Mr. Pence said. “They still harbor the dream of conquering their neighbors to the South. In recent years, North Korea has threatened Japan, the United States and our allies across this region.”

Thursday’s developments came as tanks and missile launchers rumbled through North Korea’s capital in a military parade—including the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missiles the regime first tested last year.

The parade, marking a military anniversary, was overseen by Mr. Kim, who appeared with his wife and delivered a speech urging his troops to be prepared to fight off an invasion by the U.S. and its allies.

“The invaders cannot be allowed to violate even a 0.001 millimeter” of North Korean territory, he said.

The North also paraded a new missile system, a new solid-fueled short-range ballistic missile, according to Michael Elleman, a senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, in a blog post for 38 North, a North Korea-focused blog run by Johns Hopkins University’s U.S.-Korea Institute.

Solid-fuel missiles, unlike the liquid-fuel missiles that make up the bulk of the North’s missile arsenal, are more advanced and can be fired with quicker fueling times, fewer support vehicles and greater reliability. ​

For all of the hardware on display, the parade was relatively subdued by North Korean standards. Foreign media outlets weren’t invited, and state television didn’t broadcast footage until hours later.

North Korea on Wednesday said it would send Mr. Kim’s sister to the Pyeongchang Games—the first official visit to the South by a member of the North’s ruling family—as part of its delegation. She will be joined by the North’s ceremonial head of state, 90-year-old Kim Yong Nam, who isn’t related to the younger Mr. Kim.

In a report published in several North Korean newspapers on Thursday, Pyongyang was explicit about its refusal to sit down for any talks aimed at pushing it toward relinquishing its nuclear weapons.

“The Winter Olympics has nothing to do with ‘denuclearization,’ ” the editorial said. “Is an event of ‘denuclearization’ ever on the list of the Winter Olympics?”

The North’s dismissals appeared to dim hopes in Seoul that the Olympics could be used to broker dialogue between Pyongyang and the Trump administration.

“The statement from North Korea is like a big middle finger to the U.S.,” said Kim Dong-yub, a professor of security studies at Kyungnam University. “But I think the North really had no plans or expectations to meet the U.S. during the Olympics. There is no real message that someone of Kim Yo Jong’s stature can really bring to Pence or Moon, to move the situation forward.”
