"A New York assistant school superintendent was busted for sneakily voting twice -- once in New York and again in Florida -- in the 2016 presidential election.

Spiro Colaitis, 57, of Manhasset, N.Y., an assistant superintendent for district operations for Malverne School District, located in Long Island, voted in Nassau County on Election Day and sent a mail-in-ballot to Escambia County, Florida, the State Attorney’s office in Pensacola said.

Colaitis lived in Pensacola until 2005 and sold his property in 2010, the office said. However, the man “requested, voted and returned an Escambia County vote-by-mail ballot that was processed on Oct. 25, 2016,” the arrest affidavit stated.

The Escambia County Supervisor of Elections contacted the Nassau County Board of Elections regarding Colaitis’ voting information. The Board of Elections was not told that Colaitis was under investigation.

“This is a Florida prosecution and as such we are unfamiliar with the charges,” Miriam Sholder, the Nassau County District Attorney’s Office spokeswoman said. “We will speak to Florida authorities about the matter.”

A Florida State Attorney Office investigator claimed he contacted Colaitis regarding the mail-in-ballot but he never responded.

Colaitis turned himself in to the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office on Thursday where he was charged with “casting more than one ballot in an election, a felony,” Newsday reported. He posted the $2,500 bail the same day, records showed. He is slated to be arraigned on April 26.

The Malverne School District declined to comment on the charge.

Colaitis, a retired Naval officer, is also a commander of the New York Naval Militia. The Division of Military of Naval Affairs confirmed he has taken a leave of absence following the charges.",politics

Thousands of Islamists in Pakistan launched a march toward the capital on Wednesday to protest a far-right Dutch lawmaker's plans to hold a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest later this year.

Pakistan's newly elected government has denounced the contest, calling it an attempt to defame Islam. Physical depictions of God or the prophet, even positive ones, are forbidden in Islam and considered deeply offensive.

The protest was organized by Islamist groups that made surprising gains in Pakistan's July elections. An estimated 10,000 protesters took part in the march, chanting ""we will die to protect the honor of the prophet.""

The protesters refused demands from authorities to confine their rally to the eastern city of Lahore, where it began. They are expected to reach Islamabad on Thursday.

The cartoon contest is being organized by Geert Wilders, a far-right Dutch lawmaker with a history of incendiary remarks about Islam. The Dutch government has distanced itself from the event while saying it is committed to free speech.

Pakistan's new prime minister, Imran Khan, has largely sided with the protesters, vowing to take the matter to the United Nations. His government has summoned the Dutch ambassador to lodge a formal protest, but has so far dismissed calls to expel the envoy.

Tehreek-i-Labaik, a hard-line Islamist group that helped organized the protests, supported Khan's bid to be prime minister.

Tehreek-i-Labaik disrupted life in Islamabad with a three-week rally last year against an omitted reference to the prophet in a constitutional bill. Organizers say this time they will disperse after a daylong protest.

On Tuesday, Dutch news reports suggested that a man who was detained there on suspicion of threatening to attack Wilders and parliament was a Pakistani national. Police said they detained a 26-year-old suspect who is likely to be arraigned on Friday. Wilders has for years lived under round-the-clock security due to repeated death threats linked to his criticism of Islam.

Emotions have been running high in Pakistan, where blasphemy is punishable by death and where the mere accusation of it can cause lynchings.

A former Pakistani cricketer, Khalid Latif, has offered a $28,000 reward for anyone who would ""kill the Dutchmen"" behind the blasphemous contest.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has spoken with his Dutch counterpart about the ""abominable and sacrilegious competition"" this week, according a statement released by the ministry.

He said ""such acts must be prevented as they spread hate and intolerance in societies.""

Torrential rain in Italy triggered flooding that killed at least five people Sunday in the Tuscan port town of Leghorn, including four family members trapped by rising water in their basement.

The Italian news agency ANSA said the bodies of a 4-year-old boy, his parents and grandfather were found in the flooded basement of their two-family home.

Some Italian media reports put the death toll at six in Leghorn, also known in Italy as Livorno. But the Tuscany Region civil protection chief, Cristiano Lucchi, said the sixth death was caused by a car accident unrelated to the flooding.

Lucchi said two persons were missing.

Leghorn Mayor Filippo Nogarin said a ""a crazy amount of rain"" pummeled Leghorn in the space of a few hours and ""the city is literally devastated.""

Strong winds toppled trees and many parked cars were nearly submerged by flood waters that also left streets clogged with mud.

Nogarin appealed for volunteers to help the town, which has a population of about 170,000 and is a popular transit point for travelers catching ferries to the islands of Elba and Sardinia.

Train service was interrupted in parts of the Tuscan coastal area along the Tyrrhenian Sea.

In Rome, which until recently had suffered through 3½ months of drought, the downpour quickly made streets resemble fast-moving streams and several subway stations were closed.

"Two women and three children were found dead in a home in Australia Sunday after a man surrendered himself to police and provided information leading to the gruesome discovery, officials said.

The bodies were discovered in a house in Perth in Western Australia after a man in his 20s went to the regional police station, 9News reported. It’s unclear how long the bodies had been in the house before police arrived.

""This is a tragic event and it will no doubt have an impact not only on the family and friends of the deceased, but for the whole of the community and those first responders who are faced with attending a scene of multiple deceased people,"" WA Police Assistant Commissioner Paul Steel said.

The man reportedly provided information that led police to the bodies, according to WAtoday.

A forensic team will be investigating the scene. Steel said the investigation is in the “very early stage,” but added there is no ongoing threat to the community. No further information was provided on the victims and the man in custody.

FAMILY OF SEVEN FOUND DEAD WITH GUNSHOT WOUNDS IN AUSTRALIA

Neighbors said they often saw children playing in the front yard of the home.

""It's just really sad that something like this can happen in such a quiet neighborhood, it's horrid on every level ... poor children,” Maria Manfredini, a resident in the area, told 9News.

The incident marks the third tragic event in recent months in Western Australia.

A mother and her two young children were murdered in July in the Perth suburb of Ellenbrook.

In May, a man shot his six relatives, including his four grandchildren, before turning the gun on himself at his property in Osmington. The incident was described as Australia’s worst mass shooting since 1996.",world
"Four members of a Thai youth soccer team were rescued from a cave in northern Thailand on Sunday, leaving another eight boys and their soccer coach in the flooded cavern after 18 divers began a daring mission to bring home the group who have been trapped in the flooded cavern for more than two weeks.

The first boy rescued exited the cave 5:40 p.m. local time, followed by three of his team members shortly after, Chiang Rai provincial acting Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said in a Sunday night news conference. The boys traveled 0.62 miles underwater before they reached safety.

They were taken to the hospital — three by helicopter and one by ambulance — once they were out of the cave.

The conditions of the boys were not released, but the head of joint command center coordinating the search said he met with the children and described them as being in “perfect” health and called today’s mission the “best situation.”

""The operation went much better than expected,"" Narongsak said about the rescue, which began at 10 a.m. Sunday local time.

Officials estimated the first phase of the rescue would take 12 hours, giving the divers six hours into the cave and back.

Sunday’s mission, however, took 7 hours and 40 minutes.

The next phase of the rescue operation to free the eight boys and their 25-year-old soccer coach will begin in 10 to 20 hours to allow divers to replenish oxygen supplies and evaluate the plan in place.

Rain may also delay the second phase. Heavy rain was soaking northern Thailand Sunday night after officials announced the mission was halted for the night. Incoming monsoon rains had been a concern because it could once again flood the cave and deplete oxygen levels.

A group of 18 divers — 13 foreign and five Thai — began the operation to bring the boys, ages 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach out of the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Chiang Rai province after the area saw mild weather and falling water levels in the cave. Ambulances and helicopters were on standby Sunday at the cave site to take anyone rescued from the cave to a hospital.

“Today is a D-Day for our operation,” Narongsak said Saturday.

""I confirm that we are at war with water and time from the first day up to today,"" Narongsak added. ""Finding the boys doesn't mean we've finished our mission. It is only a small battle we've won, but the war has not ended. The war ends when we win all three battles — the battles to search, rescue and send them home.""

'DON'T BLAME YOURSELF,' PARENT OF TRAPPED THAI YOUTH WRITES TO BOYS' COACH

The start of the rescue mission brought in a sense of optimism over people in Thailand. In total, more than 50 international divers and 40 Thai divers have taken part of the rescue operation. Rescuers part of the Thai navy SEAL partaking in the operation posted on Facebook showing hands locked with a caption vowing to bring the boys home.

""We, the Thai team and the international team, will bring the Wild Boars home,” referencing the boys’ soccer team name.

Though four boys have been rescued as of Sunday night, the mission to extract the rest could take two to four days depending on the conditions in the cave. The acting Chiang Rai governor had said rescuers couldn’t wait for perfect weather conditions because of several factors.

The boys and their coach became stranded when they went exploring in the cave after a practice game June 23. Monsoon flooding cut off their escape and prevented rescuers from finding them for almost 10 days.

The Thai Navy said Saturday three navy SEALs, one a doctor, were with the boys and coach. The 13 were having health evaluations and rehabilitation, and were being taught diving skills. Food, electrolyte drinks, drinking water, medicine and oxygen canisters have been delivered to them.

In letters written by the boys released Saturday, the boys appeared calm and reassured their families they were “fine.”

""Don't be worried, I miss everyone. Grandpa, Uncle, Mom, Dad and siblings, I love you all. I'm happy being here inside, the navy SEALs have taken good care. Love you all,"" wrote one of the boys named Mick.

President Trump tweeted the U.S. is ""working very closely"" with the Thai government during the rescue mission.

""The U.S. is working very closely with the Government of Thailand to help get all of the children out of the cave and to safety. Very brave and talented people!"" Trump tweeted.

"CNN political analyst April Ryan was forced to backtrack on claims that the president was “heckled and booed” at a White House event Tuesday after it was reported that the ridicule was, in fact, directed at a protester in the crowd.

Tuesday’s event was originally meant as a celebration for the Philadelphia Eagles to honor the team for its Super Bowl victory. But President Trump rescinded the invitation, accusing the team of disagreeing ""with their president because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.”

Trump instead hosted a patriotic event to celebrate America.

Ryan tweeted just after noon that it was confirmed by reporters that Trump was “heckled and booed” when he appeared on the South Lawn.

She quickly walked back those comments after learning that a heckler in the crowd was asking the president questions, and as a result was booed.

“The booes [sic] were for the heckler,” Ryan said in her tweet.

She later deleted the tweet, citing “reporters on the south lawn” for misreporting the events.

“After the tape was watched the heckler was booed not @realDonaldTrump,” she said again.

CNN’s Noah Gray said that Ryan’s tweet was not true. He later shared a picture of the man who was heckled by the crowd and escorted out.

Despite her attempts to backtrack, twitter users fired back at Ryan’s misreporting.

CNN did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment.",politics
"To believe most media descriptions of Justice Department lawyer Bruce Ohr, he is a nonentity, unworthy of the attention President Trump has given him. This is remarkable, given that Mr. Ohr spent Tuesday confirming for Congress its worst suspicions about the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s abuse of its surveillance and sourcing rules.

If Mr. Ohr is only now under the spotlight, it’s because it has taken so much effort to unpack his role in the FBI’s 2016 investigation of the Trump campaign. Over the past year, congressional investigators found out that Mr. Ohr’s wife, Nellie, worked for Fusion GPS, the opposition-research firm that gave its infamous dossier, funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign, to the FBI. They then discovered that Mr. Ohr had numerous interactions of his own with Fusion chief Glenn Simpson and dossier author Christopher Steele, and that he passed on information from these talks to the bureau. So the G-men were being fed the dossier allegations from both the outside and the inside.

This week’s news is that Mr. Ohr’s deliveries to the FBI came with a caveat. Congress already knew that Mr. Ohr had been aware of Mr. Steele’s political biases. In notes Mr. Ohr took of a September 2016 conversation with Mr. Steele, he wrote that the dossier author “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.” Congressional sources tell me that Mr. Ohr revealed Tuesday that he verbally warned the FBI that its source had a credibility problem, alerting the bureau to Mr. Steele’s leanings and motives. He also informed the bureau that Mrs. Ohr was working for Fusion and contributing to the dossier project.

Mr. Ohr said, moreover, that he delivered this information before the FBI’s first application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a warrant against Trump aide Carter Page, in October 2016. Yet the FBI made no mention of this warning in the application, instead characterizing Mr. Steele as a “reliable” source. Nor does the application note that a senior Justice Department official’s spouse was contributing to the dossier and benefiting financially from a document the FBI was using in an investigation. That matters both because the FBI failed to flag the enormous conflict and because Mr. Steele’s work product potentially wasn’t entirely his own.

"Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday vowed to be “a neutral and impartial arbiter” if confirmed to the Supreme Court, after a chaotic first day of hearings on Capitol Hill amid political theatrics and protests from Democrats.

“If confirmed to the Supreme Court, I will keep an open mind in every case,” Kavanaugh said. “I will do equal right to the poor and to the rich. I will always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law.”

Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings started Tuesday and are set to continue through the week.

Before he spoke, Kavanaugh was introduced by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman and attorney Lisa Blatt – a liberal Democrat who said she voted for Hillary Clinton for president but supports Kavanaugh’s nomination.

Democrats, in their opening remarks Tuesday, sounded the alarm about Kavanaugh’s past work in Republican politics, including as a lawyer in George W. Bush’s White House.

But Kavanaugh said Tuesday, “I don’t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences.”

Earlier Tuesday, protests from Democratic lawmakers and demonstrators delayed the formal start of proceedings by more than an hour. Within moments of Tuesday's confirmation hearing kickoff, top Democrats tried to sideline the session with a rapid-fire string of objections concerning access to the nominee's records.

The spectacle underscored the political nature of the confirmation hearings, coming two months before the midterms and as some senators gear up for a possible 2020 presidential run against President Trump. Several of those senators led the charge Tuesday in objecting to Kavanaugh.

When Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley first tried to deliver opening remarks, Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris raised objections to the committee just receiving a batch of 42,000 documents relating to the nominee's work with past administrations.

“We cannot possibly move forward,"" Harris, a potential 2020 Democratic presidential contender, said.

Grassley told her she was ""out of order,"" but other Democrats chimed in to back up Harris, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who moved to adjourn.

This prompted applause from some in the audience, and touched off protests and shouting. Then, after New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker added his voice complaining of a ""rush,"" Grassley countered: “I think you are taking advantage of my decency and my integrity.”

The chaos led Republican Sen. John Cornyn to remark, ""This is the first confirmation hearing subject to mob rule."" The Texas senator suggested Democrats would be “held in contempt of court” if they behaved that way in a court of law.

More than an hour and 15 minutes after the hearing began, Grassley moved past Democratic attempts to delay and finally delivered his opening statement, over the sustained shouts of protesters who were being escorted out of the room.

""Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified nominees – if not the most qualified nominee – I have seen,"" Grassley said.

The disruptions continued as lawmakers attempted to make opening statements. There were 63 interruptions before the break for lunch.

Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch struggled to deliver his prepared remarks, as protesters audibly shouted over him.

“I think we ought to have this loudmouth removed,"" a frustrated Hatch said. ""We shouldn't have to put up with this kind of stuff.""

Grassley acknowledged it was one of the most unruly openings of any Supreme Court hearing, saying ""this is something I've never gone through before in 15 Supreme Court nominations.""

The Capitol Police said they arrested 70 people on Tuesday.

Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin defended the outbursts.

“What we've heard is the noise of democracy,” Durbin said. “This is what happens in a free country when people can stand up and speak and not be jailed, imprisoned, tortured or killed because of it.”

Kavanaugh has left one of the longest paper trails of any recent Supreme Court nominee, having served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office in the George W. Bush administration.

Kavanaugh also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.

Booker, another possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, acknowledged he already decided to vote against Kavanaugh’s confirmation. But he pleaded to delay the vote until more documents are released.

“We should not vote now,” Booker said. “We should wait. And if we're not waiting, we should object to your nomination.”

Democrats have seen thousands of those documents, but say they want time to review and seek more.

“If you will trust the American people, they will trust you,"" Durbin told Kavanaugh. ""But if your effort today continues to conceal and hide documents, it raises a suspicion.”

Democrats have specifically raised objections over how the Senate received 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents the night before the confirmation hearing began.

“This is the most incomplete, most partisan, least transparent vetting for any Supreme Court nominee I have ever seen,” Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy said.

KAVANAUGH HEARINGS LAUNCH AMID PARTISAN FIREWORKS

Grassley, in a written statement submitted for the record, on Tuesday accused Democrats of trying to “bury this committee in millions of pages of irrelevant paperwork.” He called out California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s ranking member, for wanting to search the emails of every Bush White House aide for Kavanaugh documents.

“This would have taken months and months to complete,” Grassley said. “As I have repeatedly stated, I am not going to put the American taxpayers on the hook for the Democratic leaders’ fishing expedition.”

As the hearing kicked off, Democrats zeroed in on the controversy over the production of documents from Kavanaugh’s past work. But as the hearing went on, the Democrats began emphasizing their concern over how Kavanaugh would rule on cases involving abortion and guns.

“You are being nominated for a pivotal seat,"" Feinstein said. ""It would likely be the deciding vote on fundamental issues.”

Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse told Kavanaugh the NRA “has poured millions into your confirmation,” saying they “clearly have big expectations on how you will vote on guns.” He also expressed fear that Kavanaugh would rule to overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling regarding abortion.

“Despite confirmation etiquette, your own words make clear you don't really believe Roe vs. Wade is settled law, since the court, as you said, can always overrule its precedent,” Whitehouse said.

Republicans, though, argued Kavanaugh is highly qualified, saying Democrats aren’t making a case that he doesn’t have the experience to sit on the high court.

“If it's not about his judicial record, what is this fight about?” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said. “I believe this fight is nothing more and nothing less than an attempt by our Democratic colleagues to relitigate the 2016 presidential election.”

Harris, the California Democratic senator, took issue with Kavanaugh’s past work, saying has a history of carrying out “deeply conservative partisan agendas.”

“If we look at his record on the D.C. Circuit, and in his recent writings and statements, it is clear that the nominee has brought his political bias to the bench,” Harris said.

But Republicans argued some records sought by Democrats, from Kavanaugh’s time in the White House, are irrelevant to how he'd serve as a justice.

“The question before us today is not what does Brett Kavanaugh think 11 years ago on a policy matter,” Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse said. “The question is whether or not he has the temperament and character to take his policy views and political preferences and put them in a box marked irrelevant and set it aside every morning when he puts on the black robe.”

Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch.

“My judicial philosophy is straightforward,” Kavanaugh said Tuesday. “A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. A judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.”

The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee.

Republicans command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, which would return to 51-49 once a Republican successor to the late Sen. John McCain is seated. While the hearing was ongoing, former Sen. Jon Kyl was named to that seat.

Republicans have little margin for error, though Vice President Pence can break a tie.

Republicans have said they hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

"A coalition of high-tax blue states is suing the federal government, claiming the Republican tax overhaul singles them out by capping treasured deductions.

The lawsuit from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland amounted to their latest bid to fight the limit on state and local tax (SALT) deductions imposed by the GOP-authored tax plan.

""The federal government is hell-bent on using New York as a piggy bank to pay for corporate tax cuts and I will not stand for it,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running for re-election and is considered a possible 2020 presidential candidate, said in a statement.

The tax law signed last year caps those SALT tax deductions at $10,000.

The deduction is especially popular in high-tax, Democratic states, where many homeowners will see big increases in their federal tax bill from the change. New York estimates that taxpayers will pay $14 billion more in 2018.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the Southern District of New York, was dismissed as a long-shot political stunt by supporters of the new tax code.

But the challenge alleges that lawmakers crafted the new tax code to target left-leaning states. It claims the move interferes with their constitutionally granted taxing authority.

“This cap is unconstitutional - going well beyond settled limits on federal power to impose an income tax,” New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said in a statement.

The suit names the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department as defendants. Cuomo first announced plans to sue seven months ago and was quickly joined by leaders from the other states.

While the new law contained sweeping tax rate cuts for businesses and individuals, taxpayers in high-tax states like those in the Northeast are expected to take a hit from the SALT change. Some Republicans from those states joined Democrats last year in voicing concern about that change during the drafting of the bill.

But critics dismissed the lawsuit as a political ploy that’s not likely to prevail in the courts.

When it comes to taxing Americans, “Congress can really do what it wants,” said Tax Foundation executive vice president Joseph Bishop-Henchman. “It’s really not much of a case.”

Republicans said the plaintiff states should focus on reducing the cost of state taxes instead of taking on Washington.

“New York cannot sue its way out of high taxes,” said New York state Senate Leader John Flanagan, R-Long Island.

"A woman walking her dog was killed Monday morning when an alligator attacked her and dragged her into a lagoon in South Carolina, police said.

Beaufort County Sheriff's Office received a call around 9:30 a.m. about a possible alligator attack near a lagoon in Sea Pines Plantation, a resort community at Hilton Head Island. Officers arrived and discovered the woman’s body inside the lagoon.

According to witnesses, the unidentified woman was walking her dog when an alligator, about 8 feet long, ""attacked and pulled"" her into the water. Security staff also viewed surveillance video of the attack, South Carolina Department of Natural Resources spokesman Capt. Robert McCullough told The Post and Courier.

Authorities are at the lagoon searching for the alligator.

An autopsy will be conducted to determine the woman’s cause of death. Her dog was not harmed.

"Prosecutors on Monday rested their case against Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman accused of bank and tax fraud in a case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team.

After a day of testimony from a bank executive, prosecutors announced in court: “The government rests.”

Manafort, 69, is facing tax evasion and bank fraud charges after being accused of hiding a “significant percentage” of income earned from his Ukrainian work from the IRS. He’s also been accused of fraudulently obtaining millions more in bank loans, including while he was working on the Trump campaign.

He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Last week, the prosecution’s star witness, Rick Gates – Manafort’s former business partner who struck a plea deal to cooperate with the government -- testified that he and Manafort committed bank and tax fraud together.

MANAFORT TRIAL JUDGE DELAYS TESTIMONY FOR HOURS, WITHOUT EXPLANATION

Earlier Monday, James Brennan, the vice president of The Federal Savings Bank, testified under immunity about a loan the bank gave Manafort.

According to Brennan’s testimony, the bank approved $16 million in loans to Manafort by CEO Stephen Calk, who was angling for a cabinet position in the Trump administration.

When asked by prosecutor Greg Andres if he thought the loan should have been be approved, Brennan replied, “My recommendation was the loan not be made.”

Brennan said the loan was approved because of Calk. He said the Federal Savings Bank ended up losing $11.8 million on the loan.

The prosecution had been expected to rest on Friday. But Judge T.S. Ellis III mysteriously delayed testimony in the case for five hours on Friday. The postponement was significant, as prosecutors had been hoping to finish calling witnesses Friday -- and Ellis has a reputation as a stickler for keeping trials moving.

It’s unclear whether the defense will put forward witnesses or evidence or if the trial will head toward closing arguments. Last week, Ellis said he was limiting closing arguments to two hours for each side.

Ellis is also expected to rule on several of motions Tuesday morning. One is a standard defense motion for acquittal, claiming the prosecution has failed to prove their case. The second is a sealed matter.

Manafort’s legal troubles won’t end with this trial. He is also facing charges in a separate federal court case in Washington, including conspiring against the United States, conspiring to launder money, failing to register as an agent of a foreign principal and providing false statements.

"Meghan McCain and President Barack Obama took apparent swipes at President Trump on Saturday in a eulogy for John McCain -- who sparred with Trump on a number of occasions before his death last week of brain cancer.

""The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great,' McCain's daughter said, in what appeared to be a reference to Trump's presidential campaign slogan: ""Make America Great Again.""

The remarks were made during a funeral service at Washington National Cathedral for the Arizona Republican, who died last week of brain cancer.

Obama's jabs were more subtle but still appeared to be directed at the current occupant of the White House. He derided those in politics who traffic in ""bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage.""

He also attacked ""a politics that pretends to be brave and tough but in fact is born of fear.""

""John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that,” he said.

It was Meghan McCain who had the most searing swipes at the president however. Notably she said that her father's passing represented the passing of ""American greatness. The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.""

Former President George W. Bush also paid tribute to McCain.

""John – as he was the first to tell you – was not a perfect man. But he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have yet conceived,"" he said. ""He was motivated by a vision of America carried ever forward, ever upward, on the strength of its principles.""

The funeral service notably did not feature President Trump, who had feuded with McCain, particularly during the presidential campaign. In 2015, after McCain had said Trump's platform had ""fired up the crazies,"" Trump had mocked McCain's imprisonment in the Vietnam War, saying: ""I like people that weren't captured."" Trump has also fumed about McCain's vote last year to kill off a bill to reform ObamaCare.

Both Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were in attendance. Trump, meanwhile, went to the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. He also tweeted about subjects including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Russian investigation.

A six-term senator and a Vietnam veteran who was held as a prisoner of war for more than five years, McCain pushed for bipartisanship on the Hill. He ran against Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. He clinched the nomination in 2008 but was defeated in the presidential election by Obama.

FAREWELL STATEMENT FROM JOHN MCCAIN

Other notable speakers included former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman.

""His death seems to have reminded the American people that these values are what makes us a great nation, not the tribal partisanship and personal attack politics that have recently characterized our life, "" Lieberman, who McCain considered for his vice-presidential nominee, said.

McCain’s pallbearers included actor Warren Beatty and Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Earlier Saturday, his casket traveled to the cathedral after stopping at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where McCain’s wife Cindy laid a wreath. Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly accompanied her.

On Friday colleagues, family and friends paid tribute to his service both in the military and the Congress as he lay in state underneath the Capitol rotunda.

JOHN MCCAIN HONORED AT US CAPITOL, LAWMAKERS PAY TRIBUTE TO 'GENERATIONAL LEADER'

With members of McCain’s family in attendance, Vice President Mike Pence said Americans “marveled at the iron will of John McCain” and praised him for holding fast “to his faith in America through six decades of service.”

“Generations of Americans will continue to marvel at the man who lies before us, the cocky, handsome naval aviator who barely scraped through school, and then fought for freedom in the skies; who witnessed to our highest values, even through terrible torture; and who became a generational leader in the United States Senate, where our nation airs its great debates,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said.

Tributes have poured in from both sides of the aisle for the Republican senator and 2008 presidential nominee. On Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden remembered McCain as a brother, and said the two were “cockeyed optimists” in a memorial service for McCain at a church in Phoenix.

Biden, a Democrat, declared that McCain’s “legacy is going to continue to inspire generations.”

McCain is to be buried Sunday at his alma mater, the U.S. Naval Academy, next to his best friend from the Class of 1958, Adm. Chuck Larson.

"So how much does all this sound and fury affect the midterms?

Ordinarily, the conviction of a president's former campaign chairman and guilty pleas by his ex-national security adviser and former personal lawyer—who accused said president of directing one of his crimes—would detonate like a neutron bomb.

But as with all matters involving President Trump, the normal rules may not apply and what happens in November is anything but clear.

It's not hard to imagine a blue wave developing that would carry Democrats to control of the House. It's also not that hard to imagine that Trump’s Teflon, which has remained undented by so many past crises, enables the GOP to hang on to control. The president's grip on his base seems as strong as ever, although ambivalent Republicans could always opt to stay home.

The Michael Cohen plea, and his testimony that Trump directed him to arrange hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, has dramatically changed the political conversation.

The same goes for the Wall Street Journal revealing that Trump pal David Pecker, the CEO of American Media who runs the National Enquirer, has spoken with prosecutors under a grant of immunity. That could unravel what happened when Trump and Cohen were trying to buy the rights to McDougal’s story, which the tabloid had bought and buried for $150,000 toward the end of the 2016 campaign.

Before Tuesday, the White House and its allies had good success in keeping the focus on the lack of evidence of Russian collusion emerging in Robert Mueller’s probe. But that is changing.

Trump, for his part, told Fox's Ainsley Earhardt that he only learned of the payments ""later on,"" which contradicts not just Cohen's version but one of his tapes. The president also said this:

""Almost everybody that runs for office has campaign violations. But what Michael Cohen pled to weren't even campaign related. They weren't crimes ...

""You know, campaign violations are considered not a big deal, frankly. But if somebody defrauded a bank and he's going to get 10 years in jail or 20 years in jail but if you can say something bad about Donald Trump and you'll go down to two years or three years, which is the deal he made. In all fairness to him, most people are going to do that.""

While pundits and legal scholars debate that view, how much does all the swampiness break through to actual voters?

Both parties are struggling with ways to deal with the shadow cast by the Trump-related investigations, especially for their most vulnerable members.

The New York Times reports: ""Senior Republican Party leaders began urging their most imperiled incumbents on Wednesday to speak out about the wrongdoing surrounding President Trump, with Representative Tom Cole, a former House Republican campaign chairman, warning, 'Where there’s smoke, and there's a lot of smoke, there may well be fire.'""

The Washington Post: ""A day after President Trump's former lawyer implicated him in directing a crime, Democratic leaders sharpened their election-year attack on the GOP as the party of corruption. But in an effort to keep the electoral focus on bread-and-butter issues, they largely steered clear of any discussion of impeachment.

""Party leaders encouraged candidates and elected members to talk instead about demanding protection for the ongoing Justice Department investigations of Trump and his allies, offering a clear sign that they feel confident that grass-roots energy against Trump will show up at the polls without the need for a divisive rallying cry from the stump.""

Politico goes with this headline: ""'A New Cherry on Top': Trump Scandal Fallout Hangs Over Midterms.""

But the actual story is anticlimactic:

""However momentous, even the conviction of Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, a guilty plea involving hush money by his personal lawyer and the indictment of a key congressional ally wasn’t enough to dramatically alter the trajectory of the midterm elections.""

The truth is that no one really knows how this is going to play out.

The situation is somewhat reminiscent of 1998, when some Democrats distanced themselves from Bill Clinton as he was in the process of being impeached, but the party won five seats in the House because Newt Gingrich’s GOP was seen as overreaching.

The situation is very different because Clinton had sex with a former intern in the White House, while Trump’s alleged encounters took place more than a decade ago, although the hush money was paid during the last campaign.

The situation is also very different because Trump has an almost iron grip on most of his party, who view the investigations and media coverage of the president as unfair.

The question this fall will ultimately be whether a majority of voters want to put a check on the Trump presidency or, despite the controversies and prosecutions, leave him in full control of Washington.",politics
"A U.S. Army soldier was among four people killed when a plane carrying a group of skydivers crashed at a Georgia airport on Saturday, officials said.

The crash happened around 2 p.m. at the East Georgia Regional Airport in Swainsboro, located about 90 miles southeast of Macon, FOX54 reported.

The Emanuel County Coroner's Office told FOX5 there were five people in the plane at the time. The lone survivor was taken to a trauma center in Augusta.

The soldier who was killed was a member of U.S. Army Parachute Team, The Golden Knights, the Army announced in a Facebook post on Sunday.

Aliaksandr ""Slex"" Bahrytsevich, 31, was off-duty when he died, but served most recently as a demonstrator on the Golden Knights Black Demonstration Team, the post said. He is survived by his mother, Nattallia, and father, Mikhail.

""Alex was extremely passionate about the sport of skydiving and always sought opportunities to coach and mentor other members of the team,"" the Army wrote. ""Originally from Belarus, Alex served the US Army with distinction and pride.""

The plane crashed at the end of the runway as it was taking off, according to officials.

ARMY PILOT DIES, BROTHER INJURED IN MASSACHUSETTS SINGLE-ENGINE PLANE CRASH

The owner of the plane, The Jumping Place Skydiving Center, called the crash an ""enormous loss"" in a Facebook post.

""Today we have suffered an enormous loss. NTSB will be investigating the crash. We've lost loved ones. Please be respectful of loved ones,"" the company said.

The National Transportation Safety Board and the Emanuel County Sheriff's Office are investigating the crash, according to FOX5.",world
"A fiscally conservative Democrat soundly defeated five other high-profile opponents to represent Honolulu in Congress on Saturday, including the architect of the state's legal challenge to President Trump's travel ban and a follower of Democrat socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

The results in the deeply liberal state were yet another blow to Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who have increasingly tried to take their message mainstream ahead of the November midterm elections, only to see their preferred candidates come up short.

Former Congressman Ed Case, a 65-year-old fiscal conservative, overcame Lt. Gov. Doug Chin, who as attorney general took the Trump administration to court over a ban on travel to the United States from several countries in the Middle East. The measure, which has since been upheld by the Supreme Court, was initially ruled unconstitutional by a Hawaii federal judge.

After his loss Saturday, Chin praised ""people who don't want to take the country for granted and want to make the country a better place.""

DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST TORCH-BEARERS FLAME OUT NATIONALLY, DESPITE HIGH-PROFILE ENDORSEMENTS

Case also took down 29-year-old Kaniela Ing, a democratic socialist who hoped to follow in the footsteps of colleague Ocasio-Cortez of New York to score an upset victory. Ing, a state representative, had Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement, and the Bronx socialist candidate had stumped for him.

Overall, Case received 47,482 votes, or 40 percent of the total, compared to 25.5 percent for Chin, and only 6.3 percent for Ing.

""Two weeks before my race, I was polling 35 points down,"" Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday during a major campaign event for Ing, which local reports said was one of the biggest in the state's history. ""And we changed that in two weeks because we were talking to people who hadn’t been excited about the political process before.""

Hawaii's high taxes and surging homelessness put a dent in enthusiasm for establishment Democrats in the deep-blue state, leading some analysts to predict Ing would have performed better. But his loss, like the primary defeats last week of populist Michigan gubernatorial hopeful Abdul El-Sayed and congressional candidate Fayrouz Saad, as well as Kansas House candidate and former Sanders staffer Brent Welder, left Ocasio-Cortez's followers empty-handed.

Case will face Cam Cavasso, a former state representative who previously ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate.

Meanwhile, Hawaii Gov. David Ige won the state's Democratic primary Saturday in his bid for a second term, overcoming a tough primary challenge and fierce criticism after state officials sent out a false inbound missile alert earlier this year and left it uncorrected for more than 30 minutes.

Ige defeated U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, who gave up her seat in Congress to run for governor. Ing took 51.4 percent of the vote with 119,310 ballots, compared to Hanabusa's 44.4 percent.

The incumbent in November will face state Rep. Andria Tupola, who won the Republican gubernatorial primary.

Officials mistakenly sent a warning of an imminent missile attack, promising “THIS IS NOT A DRILL,” to cellphones, radios and televisions on Jan. 13. Hanabusa used the false alarm as a key campaign cudgel against Ige.

But the governor's handling of the Kilauea volcano's latest eruption, which destroyed more than 700 homes and displaced thousands, as well as devastating flooding on Kauai, may have improved his stature.

Also, Ron Curtis will face off against incumbent Sen. Mazie Hirono in the general election as the Republican Party's nominee to represent Hawaii in the U.S. Senate. Hirono, who was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and became the first Asian-American female senator, is widely expected to win in November.

Other primary vote-tally updates

In Washington State, there was some good news for Democrats: It's looking more likely that the race for Washington's 9th Congressional District will have two Democrats on the ballot in November, as votes continue to be counted from last week's primary.

WATCH: WASHINGTON CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE AIMS TO BE THE NEXT OCASIO-CORTEZ

After King and Pierce Counties updated their ballot counts Friday night, Democrat Sarah Smith was 2,582 votes ahead of Republican Doug Basler, a significant jump from her 196-vote lead the day before. If her lead holds, she'll advance along with Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, who has represented the progressive district that includes part of Seattle for more than two decades.

Adam Smith, the heavy favorite in November, secured about 49.3 percent of the vote, compared to Sarah Smith's 25.5 percent.

Under Washington's primary system, all candidates appear on the same ballot and the top two vote getters advance to the general election, regardless of party. Washington is a vote-by-mail state and elections officials will continue tallying ballots next week.

Sarah Smith was recruited to run by Brand New Congress, the same group that backed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in New York's Democratic primary this summer.

Also in Washington, another race where votes were still being tallied is the 8th Congressional District, where Democrat Kim Schrier is maintaining her lead for the second spot in hopes of advancing to the general election.

Schrier, a pediatrician, increased her lead in updated returns Friday over attorney Jason Rittereiser. Republican Dino Rossi, a former state lawmaker who had unsuccessful runs for governor and the U.S. Senate, advanced Tuesday to the November election.

KOBACH RECUSES HIMSELF IN KANSAS AS VOTE-COUNTING CONTINUES IN TIGHTH RACE

The two are seeking the seat left open by long-time incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert, who is retiring. The seat has been held by Republicans since it was created in the early 1980s. The district is among about two dozen across the country that are held by Republicans but whose voters chose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, making it a critical potential pickup for the Democrats trying to gain control of the House for the first time since 2010.

And in Kansas, the counting of the last ballots in the tight and contentious Republican primary for governor will stretch out over the next week and still might not settle the race.

Trump-backed Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach leads Gov. Jeff Colyer by 110 votes out of 313,000-plus cast after late mail-in ballots from all 105 counties were added Friday to totals from advance voting and ballots cast at the polls Tuesday.

The state's 105 counties still must review nearly 9,000 provisional ballots and determine how many of them were cast in the Republican primary — and how many will be counted. They have until Aug. 20 to finish that process and certify their local results.

"Despite the guilty plea he entered Aug. 21 to charges of campaign finance law violations, it appears that President Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, did not actually violate the Federal Election Campaign Act.

This is extraordinarily important, because if Cohen didn’t violate campaign finance law when he acted on Trump’s behalf, that means that Trump didn’t violate campaign finance law either – despite claims by the president’s opponents and many in the media that the president was an “unindicted co-conspirator” and broke the law along with Cohen.

“Equal justice under law” is a phrase engraved on the front of the U.S. Supreme Court building, but the Justice Department sometimes fails spectacularly to live up to this ideal. This is illustrated by the way it aggressively targeted Cohen for alleged campaign finance law violations – but gave everyone in Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign a “get out of jail free card” for such violations.

It is hard to continue to have faith in the objectivity of the Justice Department in the face of what seems like politically driven prosecution decisions to throw the book at Cohen – and implicate President Trump in allegedly illegal conduct – while ignoring clear lawbreaking by the Clinton campaign.

No one is questioning the legitimacy of the guilty pleas Cohen entered Aug. 21 in federal court to six tax evasion and bank fraud charges. But those charges have nothing to do with President Trump. They involve Cohen’s failure to report over $4 million in income from work with taxi companies, along with several hundred thousand dollars in other income, to the Internal Revenue Service.

But you have to wonder about the legal advice Cohen received when he pleaded guilty on the same day to two violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act – the law that governs the financing of federal elections campaigns. Many election law experts, including former commissioners on the Federal Election Commission (FEC), say his conduct, however sleazy, didn’t violate the law.

I’m one of those former commissioners and I’m also a former Justice Department attorney. Based on my experience serving in government and now as a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, it appears to me that Cohen was innocent of the campaign finance law violations.

The law Cohen pleaded guilty to violating bans campaign contributions by banks, corporations and labor unions. It also limits the amount that an individual can contribute to a candidate. During the 2016 election cycle, that limit was $2,700.

Civil violations of the law are enforced by the FEC. Criminal violations of the law are enforced by the Justice Department. A civil violation becomes a criminal violation when someone intentionally and knowingly violates the law.

Here’s how the Federal Election Campaign Act works: For the rules, contribution limits, and reporting requirements of law to apply to an expenditure, it has to be made “for the purpose of influencing” a federal election. But such a broad definition could cover anything on which a candidate spends money.

As former FEC Chairman Bradley Smith says, that could include “buying a good watch to make sure he gets to places on time, to getting a massage so that he feels fit for the campaign trail, to buying a new suit so that he looks good on a debate stage.”

So the campaign finance law specifies that such personal expenses are not considered campaign-related expenses even though they might “influence” the election outcome.

Personal expenses are defined as “any commitment, obligation, or expense of a person that would exist irrespective of the candidate’s election campaign.” That would include expenses such as clothing purchases, home mortgages, etc.

Cohen pleaded guilty to “willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution” and making “an excessive campaign contribution” according to the agreement sent to Cohen’s lawyer by the Acting U.S. Attorney, Robert Khuzami on Aug. 21. The contributions are defined as hush-money payments Cohen arranged to two women who claimed they had affairs with Trump years before the 2016 election.

According to Cohen’s guilty plea he made one payment of $130,000 directly to porn star Stormy Daniels (whose real name is Stephanie Clifford) and was reimbursed by Trump or a Trump corporate entity.

Also according to Cohen’s plea, another payment of $150,000 was made by the National Enquirer to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for the rights to her story alleging she had a months-long affair with Trump. The tabloid, run by Trump friend David Pecker, never published the story.

The key question in determining whether Cohen broke the campaign finance law is: Were the payments to Daniels and McDougal personal expenses or campaign-related expenses?

Many legal experts don’t believe such payments are campaign-related. Wealthy celebrities are faced with these types of embarrassing claims all the time, and often pay nuisance settlements (even if they are not running for office) to avoid bad publicity.

The Justice Department only prosecuted someone for a campaign finance law violation like the one Cohen pleaded guilty to on one occasion and the department lost its case – despite having stronger evidence.

The previous prosecution took place in 2012 and targeted a former Democratic vice presidential nominee, presidential candidate and senator, John Edwards. The Justice Department argued that $1 million paid by campaign contributors to Edward’s mistress – who was working for his presidential campaign – was a campaign-related expense. Prosecutors said the contribution exceeded the legal limit and should have been reported.

The government was unsuccessful in its claim that these payments were intended to “influence the election” by hiding Edwards’ affair when he was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Edwards was acquitted on one charge and a mistrial was declared on five other counts.

At his trial, Edwards’ lawyers sent a letter to the Justice Department telling the government that in the opinion of two former FEC chairmen – Scott Thomas and Ron Lenhard – the payments to Edwards’s mistress were “not a campaign-related expense and could not be lawfully paid by the campaign or reimbursed by the campaign.”

It is illegal under the Federal Election Campaign Act to use campaign funds to pay the personal expenses of a candidate. As former FEC chairman Smith points out, if Trump had used campaign funds to pay off Daniels and McDougal, does anyone doubt that “the same people now after Trump for using corporate funds, and not reporting them as campaign expenditures, would then be claiming that Trump had illegally diverted campaign funds to ‘personal use’?”

I have little doubt that President Trump’s opponents would be urging the same U.S. Attorney’s Office to prosecute the Trump campaign for using campaign funds to pay off this personal obligation.

Smith says that “at the very least, the law is murky about whether paying hush money to a mistress is a ‘campaign expense’ or a personal expense.”

So what does this all mean?

It means that experts disagree on whether Cohen’s actions violated the campaign finance law, and some former commissioners at the agency charged with enforcing the law don’t think payments to a mistress fall within the purview of the law.

In addition, another expert on the campaign finance law and a former FEC attorney, Craig Engle, pointed out to me that the payment the National Enquirer made to buy the rights to McDougal’s story also cannot possibly constitute a prohibited corporate campaign finance violation.

The Federal Election Campaign Act contains a broad media exemption that applies to “any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication” unless it is owned by a candidate. Since there is nothing illegal about the National Enquirer buying the story rights, Cohen’s urging the publication to do so can’t be illegal.

Pecker, the head of the company that publishes the National Enquirer, has reportedly been granted immunity for his testimony on this – despite the fact that under that exemption, he can’t legitimately be charged with a campaign finance law violation, no matter what the U.S. Attorney’s Office is telling him.

Now let’s turn to the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. In August 2015, the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) entered into a memorandum of understanding that essentially handed over the operation of the DNC to the Clinton campaign.

This gave the Clinton campaign control over the finances, activities and expenditures of the DNC, including more than $84 million raised by the DNC and state Democratic parties.

Cleta Mitchell, one of the foremost campaign finance lawyers in Washington, calls this a “massive scheme to completely evade the legal contribution limits to the Clinton campaign” and the “greatest campaign-finance scandal in history.”

This comes on top of the misreporting by the DNC, the Clinton campaign, and their law firm of the payment to Fusion GPS for opposition research against Trump by former British spy Christopher Steele. This research started the investigation by the FBI and later Special Counsel Robert Mueller of Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible cooperation between Russia and the Trump campaign to help Trump win the election.

The Clinton campaign payment to Fusion GPS was falsely reported to the FEC as “legal fees,” with no mention of who it was paid to or what the actual purpose was – a straight-out violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act.

So what gives? Why is the same U.S. Attorney’s Office ignoring the potential massive violation of campaign finance law by the Clinton campaign, yet lowering the hammer on Cohen for questionable conduct that does not seem to actually violate the law? And why are Justice Department lawyers wasting time pursuing these non-campaign finance violations against other individuals?

The conclusion seems unavoidable: Cohen was targeted for prosecution because he was Donald Trump’s lawyer, and Hillary Clinton’s campaign got off scot-free because she was Trump’s opponent. What we have here is unequal justice under law, based on politics.",politics
"In a twist all-too-familiar for anyone who watched her villain persona on reality TV, Omarosa Manigault-Newman has turned – on her former mentor, her former colleagues and anyone else who crossed her during her brief time in politics.

The famously vindictive TV personality-turned-aide, in her forthcoming book due out Tuesday, aims to settle countless scores. She blasts President Trump as “moblike.” She depicts tensions inside the first family. She mocks her former campaign and White House co-workers.

And that's in addition to her accusations of racism against Trump that have featured heavily in her promotional interviews.

Fox News obtained an advance copy of the sensational tell-all, “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House.” In it, she details her long working relationship with the now-president, from her rise to fame on his show ""The Apprentice"" to her work on the campaign and later in the White House.

But, months after her firing, she has traded her praise of the administration for payback. And no blow is too low, including swipes at former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, who also served as press secretary for the Trump campaign.

In the book, Manigault-Newman accuses Hicks of lacking “the understanding of politics for the job she was given.”

“She was always Googling terms while we were in meetings, always playing catch-up, always sensitive about what she didn’t know,” Manigault-Newman writes. “She was so painfully aware of her inadequacies, she refused to speak publicly about the campaign or as a surrogate to express the candidate’s views.”

Manigault-Newman also accuses Trump, whom she calls her “mentor” throughout the book, of expecting “moblike” loyalty, likening him to a “cult leader.”

“Loyalty is a loaded topic when it comes to Donald Trump. His moblike loyalty requirements are exacting, imperishable, and sometimes unethical (as in James Comey’s case.),” she writes. “But for the people in Trumpworld, loyalty to him is an absolute and unyielding necessity, akin to followers’ devotion to a cult leader.”

She alleges: “Trumpworld is a cult of personality focused solely on Donald J. Trump.”

At one point, she deploys a Trumpian nickname for the president: ""Twitter Fingers.""

But Trump has deployed his own for the author, dubbing her ""Wacky Omarosa"" on Monday as she hits the interview circuit, as his aides come out in force to decry her conduct.

Drawing pointed condemnation from the West Wing was her decision to release tapes of secretly recorded conversations, including with Trump himself.

That recording was released Monday on NBC’s “Today,” purporting to capture a conversation between Manigault-Newman and Trump after she was fired by Chief of Staff John Kelly in December. In the tape, Trump claims he didn’t know about her firing in advance.

Over the weekend, Manigault-Newman released a different recording, of that conversation with Kelly in the Situation Room.

White House officials blasted her for making both recordings.

“The thought of doing something like that to a fellow employee, not to mention the leader of the free world, is completely disgraceful,” Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told ""Fox & Friends.""

And on Monday, Trump tweeted that, “People in the White House hated her. She was vicious, but not smart.”

Her firing is a key section of the new book. In it, she goes so far as to claim that Kelly and the White House lawyers present, upon notifying her of her termination, were holding her against her will in the Situation Room, suggesting she was at risk of an asthma attack because she initially couldn't get her inhaler.

“I am an asthma sufferer, and I began to feel a tightness in my chest. I had to calm myself down or I could have had a full-blown asthma attack,” Manigault-Newman writes in the prologue. “I asked if I could go get my purse where I had stashed my inhaler, and they wouldn’t let me leave the room. I asked why I was not allowed to leave, and they said this is how Kelly had set up the meeting.”

Manigault-Newman’s assistant was ultimately allowed to “go get [her] purse” with the inhaler.

“My asthma is triggered by stressful situations, and this was definitely one. I asked again if I was allowed to leave the room or speak to my husband, and they refused,” she wrote. “I was being held against my will in a secure room guarded by men with guns.”

Manigault-Newman also writes in the book that she believed her firing was related to her knowledge of a tape made in the early 2000s, in which Trump supposedly uses “the N-word.”

That claim has been the subject of intense dispute, as she says in the book that the tape exists but she hadn't heard it. Yet on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, she said she has since heard it

Monday evening, Trump tweeted that ""The Apprentice"" producer Mark Burnett had assured him that no such tape existed of him using ""such a terrible and disgusting word.""

""I don't have that word in my vocabulary, and never have,"" Trump wrote. ""She made it up.""

The president then claimed that ""Omarosa had Zero credibility with the Media (they didn’t want interviews) when she worked in the White House. Now that she says bad about me, they will talk to her. Fake News!""

The former White House aide makes a slew of other accusations in her book, sure to be chewed over for days by the president's allies and detractors alike.

In other sections, she gets deeply personal about the first family. She says that daughter Tiffany Trump was “treated like a California castoff,” and that Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, was “desperate to please his father.”

“Don Jr. has been struggling against the negative expectation of his namesake since the moment he was born,” Manigault-Newman writes, going on to state that candidate-Trump did not attend his eldest son’s convention speech, but instead watched Eric’s.

“He beamed with pride at his second son,” she writes. “When Donald sat there to watch Eric, I felt sorry for Don Jr.”

She later quotes Trump as calling Trump Jr. “a f---up” over his comment likening Syrian refugees to “a bowl of Skittles.”

Manigault-Newman lobs a slew of other shots at the first family, including claiming first lady Melania Trump wants a divorce when he's out of office.

Plus she writes that, ""Our president is mentally and physically impaired.""

The White House on Friday responded to early leaks of the book's contents with a blanket statement decrying it. ""Instead of telling the truth about all the good President Trump and his administration are doing to make America safe and prosperous, this book is riddled with lies and false accusations,"" Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.

Manigault-Newman also blasts former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, now on trial, as a “liability,” and former Trump campaign chief strategist Steve Bannon as an “alarming” choice, slamming him as a “sexist and racist.”

And as for Russia, Manigault-Newman claims that Trump “lacked basic comprehension about the very complicated relationship” between the U.S. and Russia.

“He was fixated on Vladimir Putin as a feared, respected, and admired leader,” she writes. “I believe he was envious of the control that Putin exerts over his people.”

In another skirmish, Trump tweeted Monday that Manigault-Newman signed a non-disclosure agreement upon her exit from the White House. But the former White House aide writes in her book that she “refused” to sign an NDA.

Tottenham forward Son Heung-min will get to skip military service.

Son avoided the service obligation when South Korea defeated Japan 2-1 in the Asian Games gold medal soccer game on Saturday.

The South Korean government rewards holders of Asian Games gold medals and all Olympic medals with the exemption. Military service is compulsory for South Korean males, and the 26-year-old Son would have faced at least 21 months of service and the loss of millions in income.

Son ran wildly onto the field at the end, hugging teammates with hundreds of South Korea flags flying.

With the match in extra time after 0-0 in regulation, Son got the break he wanted from teammate Lee Seung-woo.

In the 93rd minute, Son broke toward the middle and shuffled a pass to Lee, who drove the ball with his left foot into the top of the net. He immediately posed atop sign boards alongside the edge of the field, celebrating his minute of glory.

South Korea clinched it eight minutes later on a leaping header inside the far post from Hwang Hee-chan. The 101st-minute goal prompted Son to embrace South Korean coach Kim Hak-bum on the sidelines.

Japan's Ayase Ueda scored on a header with five minutes left to make it close.

South Korea had 65 percent of the possession in regulation time, and had a wide edge in shots, and shots-on goal.

Son almost got the winning goal himself, but his shot just seconds into extra time sailed inches wide of the far post.

Saturday was the last full day of competition at the Asian Games with only one medal event on Sunday — mixed triathlon. The closing ceremony is also Sunday.

Japan also came up short as South Korea won gold in baseball with a 3-0 victory. In the bronze medal game, Taiwan pummeled China 10-0.

China won women's basketball, defeating the combined Koreas women's team 71-65. Shao Ting topped China's scorers with 17 points. Lim Yunghui was the top Korean scorer with 24. Park Ji-su had 15.

The women's squad included nine South Koreans and three from North Korea.

Dragon boat races delivered a gold medal and two bronze medals for the combined Koreas teams during the games — the feel-good story of the Asian Games.

China's men's basketball team also took gold, defeating Iran 84-72.

As expected, China swept all five gold medals in table tennis at the Asian Games including the two singles finals on Saturday. Both finals were all-China finals.

Fan Zhendong defeated Lin Gaoyuan in the men's final, and for the women Chen Meng beat Wang Manyu.

Kazakhstan defeated Japan 8-7 to take the men's gold in water polo.

"Climb into the cockpit of a plane and start it up. It’s as simple as flicking a switch.

“They don’t necessarily use a key so there’s a switch that they use to start the aircraft,” National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) official Debra Eckrote said Saturday as she briefed reporters on the theft of a Horizon Air Q400 by a “suicidal” airline employee who crashed it into a remote island in Washington State after a 90-minute fight.

That employee has been identified as Richard Russell, 29, a Horizon Air employee, who is presumed dead after Friday's crash.

Eckrote said Friday’s event was very unusual.

“It’s not like we get this every day,” she said.

The FBI is investigating how the thief was able steal the plane, which was parked at a maintenance area, and take off without clearance from air traffic controllers.

'SUICIDAL' AIRLINE EMPLOYEE WHO STOLE PLANE FROM SEATAC AIRPORT HAD BIZARRE CONVERSATION WITH AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL BEFORE CRASHING

The thief was described as a Horizon ground service agent at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport with an identification card that allowed him access to be near planes in secure areas.

“He was able to take the aircraft and get it airborne and we do know he was in communication with air traffic control,” Eckrote said.

“This is probably jail time for life, huh?” he said during his conversation with an air traffic controller. “I would hope it is for a guy like me.”

Eckrote said she believes the man had a basic understanding of how to power up a plane because of his background as an airline employee.

Horizon officials said Saturday the thief did not have a pilot’s license and used a push-back tractor to spin the plane 180 degrees where it was parked.

Video showed the turboprop plane doing large loops and other dangerous maneuvers as the sun set on Puget Sound.

Of course, there's a lot more to flying a plane than just starting the engines. Aviation attorney Mark Dombroff told Fox News Saturday that it was striking that the thief actually flew for 90 minutes.

“The fact that he was aloft for almost 90 minutes without the airplane crashing, the fact that he was able to take off the airplane in the first instance, would suggest that he had a lot of familiarity with the aircraft controls and capabilities,” Dombroff said. “He may well have had a lot of experience flying a computer-based flight simulator, one you can buy in a computer store.”

The bizarre case points to a peril for commercial air travel --- conjuring images of airport employees causing mayhem.

'SUICIDAL' AIRLINE EMPLOYEE WHO STOLE PLANE FROM SEATAC AIRPORT HAD BIZARRE CONVERSATION WITH AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL BEFORE CRASHING

""The greatest threat we have to aviation is the insider threat,"" Erroll Southers, a former FBI agent and transportation security expert, told The Associated Press. ""Here we have an employee who was vetted to the level to have access to the aircraft and had a skill set proficient enough to take off with that plane.""

There have been other instances involving airplanes and people intent on snatching them.

On Tuesday, for instance, an 18-year-old was formally charged with attempting to steal an American Eagle twin-engine jet so he could fly it to a rap concert in another state last month.

Zemarcuis Devon Scott was arrested after police found him sitting in the cockpit at Texarkana Regional Airport.

Police asked about Scott’s lack of pilot training, and he allegedly said he didn't believe there was much more to flying than pushing buttons and pulling levers.

In 2003, Ben Padilla, a private pilot, stole a Boeing 727-223 in Angola with an accomplice. The aircraft began taxiing with no communication between the crew and the tower. It then maneuvered erratically, entered a runway without clearance and took off with its lights off and its transponder not transmitting, Smithsonian Air & Space magazine reported.

The 727, Padilla and his cohort haven’t been seen since.

"In the last century, socialism and communism proved to be bankrupt ideologies that crippled economies, impoverished millions, destroyed personal freedom, brought dictators to power, sparked wars and turned millions of people into refugees fleeing their home countries to seek freedom in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Nations in Eastern Europe abandoned the failed ideologies. The Soviet Union broke up. And even Russia and China were forced to adopt some free market practices to improve their economies and the lives of their people.

But today, the hottest trend among some far-left Democrats is to embrace socialism – calling it “Democratic socialism” to make it sound more appealing.

Going off the deep end like this is a sure-fire losing strategy for Democrats, because the farther left they go the more Americans get left behind. It’s a safe bet that voters are more likely to support the party of Lincoln than the party of Lenin.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – a self-described Democratic Socialist who nearly captured the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 – now touts Denmark and Sweden as his models of socialism. But it wasn’t too long ago that he and others praised Venezuela as a beacon of the socialist dream.

Today Democrats are loath to mention Venezuela, where the economy is in freefall and almost 90 percent of the people are living in poverty. But many nevertheless loudly praise the socialist ideology that is responsible for much of Venezuela’s troubles.

Following in the footsteps of Venezuela would be the quickest way to turn the American Dream into the American Nightmare.

Sanders is far from the only Democratic Socialist around. Look no further than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 28-year-old U.S. House candidate strongly supported by the Democratic Socialists of America. She defeated fourth-ranking Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley of New York City in a primary victory that took the nation by surprise.

Ocasio-Cortez recently said: “Right now, we have this hyper-capitalism. ... What that means is profit at any cost. Capitalism has not always existed in the world, and it will not always exist in the world.”

Sounds an awful lot like a recent graduate’s way of summing up this principle from Karl Marx’s “Communist Manifesto”: “What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.”

Maybe next Ocasio-Cortez can adopt Marx’s famous call to action as her campaign slogan: “Workers of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains!”

Stunningly, despite Ocasio-Cortez’s embrace of socialism, she has been welcomed into a Democratic Party that has at least rhetorically tried to distance itself from socialism. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez says that Ocasio-Cortez “represents the future of our party.”

Meanwhile, a Morning Consult/Politico poll revealed that a shockingly high 35 percent of Democrats say “it’s somewhat or very important” to replace House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., with a socialist.

According to The Associated Press: “There are 42 people running for offices at the federal state and local levels this year with the formal endorsements of the Democratic Socialists of America.” The number of formal, dues-paying members of the Democratic Socialists has skyrocketed from 6,000 to 45,000.

The Associated Press story went on to say of the Democratic Socialists: “Members during public meetings often refer to each other ‘comrades,’ wear clothing featuring socialist symbols like the rose and promote authors such as Karl Marx. The common association with the failed Soviet Union has made it difficult for sympathetic liberals to explain their connection.”

Indeed, the lurch of Democrats toward socialism has been well underway for some time. Consider the following list put together by my colleague, Rapid Response Director for the Republican National Committee Michael Ahrens:

Single-Payer Health-Care

When Bernie Sanders first offered a single-payer health-care bill in 2013, he didn’t have a single co-sponsor in the Senate. Today one-third of Senate Democrats and two-thirds of House Democrats have endorsed the radical plan.

Democrats endorse government-run health-care despite the empirical evidence of its failure. In Canada’s government-run system, wait times are now more than double what they were 25 years ago, with the average Canadian waiting to see a specialist for approximately five months.

According to one study: “63,090 Canadian women may have died as a result of increased wait times (in Canada) between 1993 and 2009.”

The story of the United Kingdom’s socialized medicine system is no different. The National Health Service in Britain recently reported its worst accident and emergency wait times on record. According to the BBC: “It is estimated there are up to 9,000 deaths in hospitals each year caused by failings in NHS care.”

And yet, single-payer health-care is the rallying cry of Democrats.

Free College

Though Bernie Sanders had zero co-sponsors for his free-college plan in the past, today he has seven co-sponsors of his legislation, along with several potential 2020 Democratic presidential contenders.

Democrats ignore the failed free-college experiment in the United Kingdom, which increased inequality and depleted student resources, therefore leading the British to reintroduce tuition. Democrats likewise ignore that “college-attainment rates were higher in G-7 countries that charged tuition than in those that did not.”

Government-Mandated Wage

Once again, Sanders’ five co-sponsors of a government-mandated wage from 2015 ballooned into 30 co-sponsors.

Democrats who sign on to this plan do so at the behest of low-income workers. As the Washington Post noted, a “very credible” study on Seattle’s $15 minimum wage law revealed that “the average low-wage worker in the city lost $125 a month because of the hike in the minimum” and the resulting number of employers who cut payroll, stopped hiring, or let employees go.

Universal Basic Income

Once relegated to the far-left fringe, universal basic income (where the government gives cash payouts to its citizens) recently received its biggest endorsement yet, this time from President Obama.

Obama’s suggestion that we “consider new ways of thinking … like a universal income” came on the heels of Finland’s basic income program failure, with the country announcing it would not be continuing its two-year experiment.

Experts note that a universal basic income would come with a $3.6 trillion price tag each year, requiring a doubling of the federal budget at a time when our country holds $21 trillion in debt.

Single-payer health-care, free college, a government-mandated wage, universal basic income, government-guaranteed jobs (another recent proposal) and the increasing acceptance of these radical ideas among Democrats signify a slow and troubling creep toward socialism.

What the Democrats neglect to mention is that paying for all these “free” goodies would require massive tax increases. And there aren’t enough rich people to pay for all the freebies without raising taxes on the rest of us.

As the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher so wisely said: “The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples’ money.”",politics
"Nearly a dozen Republican members of Congress on Wednesday sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department and FBI seeking an investigation of former bureau boss James Comey, his deputy Andrew McCabe, ex-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Hillary Clinton in connection with 2016 campaign controversies.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions already announced last month he had assigned a federal prosecutor to review some of those broader issues, while resisting calls for a second special counsel. But the referral represents an escalation of Republican pressure to probe top Democrats and Trump critics.

Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., and 10 other House lawmakers want an investigation into potential violations that cover everything from the handling of the Clinton email probe to the anti-Trump dossier’s funding to the Uranium One controversy. They made their case in a letter sent Wednesday to Sessions, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and U.S. Attorney John Huber, whom Sessions named to lead the previously announced evaluation.

Complaining about “dissimilar degrees of zealousness” in the investigations into Clinton and Trump campaign associates, they wrote:

“Because we believe that those in positions of high authority should be treated the same as every other American, we want to be sure that the potential violations of law outlined below are vetted appropriately.”

They named Comey, Clinton, Lynch, McCabe, FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page and several others as figures who should be investigated.

The Comey section focused in part on a statement Comey drafted before interviewing Clinton as part of the email probe. Republicans have long called it an exoneration statement that effectively cleared her months before the case was over. The GOP letter suggested this presents a conflict with Comey’s September 2016 congressional testimony in which he said they made the decision not to recommend criminal charges after interviewing Clinton.

“They made this determination months before,” DeSantis, who is running for Florida governor, told “Fox & Friends.” “The lack of candor with the Congress is something that needs to be investigated.”

Comey brushed off the claims during an interview Wednesday on ABC’s “The View.”

Asked about the letter, Comey said ""the accusations are not true,"" but added that he has confidence in the inspector general, which is already reviewing the handling of the email probe.

""Let's let the institution do its work,"" he said.

Comey also defended the early draft statement on the conclusion of the Clinton case in his newly released book.

“Any investigator or prosecutor who doesn’t have a sense, after nearly a year of investigation, where their case is likely headed, is incompetent. Prosecutors routinely begin drafting indictments before an investigation is finished if it looks likely to end up there, and competent ones also begin thinking how to end investigations that seem likely to end without charges,” Comey explained in ""A Higher Loyalty.""

The GOP lawmakers also cited Comey’s decision to write and share memos detailing conversations with Trump.

The potential violations they cited included perjury and unauthorized removal of classified documents – though Comey has maintained the memos did not contain classified material.

As for Clinton, the GOP lawmakers cited a single concern – that a lawyer representing her 2016 campaign paid the firm behind the research that led to the controversial anti-Trump dossier. The letter argued that they disguised the payments by not properly disclosing them to the Federal Election Commission.

A Clinton spokesman slammed the referral as “pathetic” and politically motivated.

“House Republicans have seen the numbers and are running scared as we head into midterm season. They should focus on working for the people they are asking to reelect them, not do Trump’s bidding. It’s pathetic,” Nick Merrill said.

The referral's Lynch section cited an alleged threat of “reprisal” against an informant in the Uranium One case, which dealt with the controversial Obama administration deal that gave Russia partial control over the U.S. uranium supply.

The lawmakers also hit McCabe over the same issues raised in a recent DOJ inspector general report that found he leaked to the media and later lied about it. The former FBI deputy director was fired last month by Sessions just days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension after it was determined that he misled investigators.

The section on Strzok and Page focused on their “interference in the Hillary Clinton investigation.” The two FBI officials, who worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team for a short period and were romantically involved, frequently shared anti-Trump text messages.

Lastly, the lawmakers asked that Sessions investigate personnel connected to the “compilation of documents on alleged links between Russia and then-presidential candidate Donald Trump known as the 'Steele dossier.'"" The letter cites those individuals as McCabe, Comey, former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and FBI General Counsel Dana Boente, among others.

The dossier was presented to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to obtain a warrant to conduct surveillance on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Comey signed three FISA applications for Page, while McCabe and current Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (who oversees the Russia probe), Yates and Boente each signed at least one. In a footnote to the letter, the lawmakers wrote that “due to the possible involvement of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in signing an application for continued surveillance on Carter Page, Rosenstein should be recused from any examination of FISA abuse.”",politics
"The White House announced Friday that Technical Sgt. John Chapman, who lost his life in Afghanistan in 2002 and is credited with saving the lives of his fellow teammates, will be awarded the Medal of Honor by President Trump next month.

Trump will present the award posthumously to Chapman’s wife, Valerie Nessel, and his family on August 22, making him the first airman to receive a Medal of Honor for actions since the Vietnam War, the Air Force Times reported.

The Connecticut native is being recognized for his “selfless service and sacrifice” exhibited on March 4, 2002, on Takur Ghar mountain.

Chapman’s aircraft came under heavy enemy fire, eventually being struck with a rocket-propelled grenade which resulted in one of the team members being ejected, according to the White House.

Despite a crash landing, Chapman led the special operations team through hazardous and snow conditions in the mountain, behind enemy lines, in an attempt to rescue the stranded airman.

Chapman was severely wounded after engaging in enemy fire but eventually secured the opposition’s bunker.

“Despite severe wounds, he continued to fight relentlessly, sustaining a violent engagement with multiple enemy personnel before paying the ultimate sacrifice. Sergeant Chapman’s heroic actions, at the cost of his life, are credited with saving the lives of his teammates,” the White House wrote.

Chapman enlisted in the Air Force in September 1985 as an information systems operator; he later went on to become a combat controller and was hired for a special duty assignment at the 24th Special Tactics squadron.",politics
"A Boeing 737 plane operated by state airline Cubana crashed after taking off from Jose Marti International Airport in Havana on Friday and three passengers were said to have survived in critical condition, local media reported.

The surviving passengers have been brought to the hospital, according to newspaper Granma.

The flight from Havana to Holguin, a city in eastern Cuba, had 104 passengers and nine crew members on board.

The plane lay in a farm field and appeared heavily damaged and burnt. It crashed around noon not far from the end of the runway. The cause remains under investigation.

Government officials, including President Miguel Diaz-Canel, rushed to the site, along with a large number of emergency medical workers and ambulances.

""There is a high number of people who appear to have died,"" Diaz-Canel said from the scene. ""Things have been organized, the fire has been put out, and the remains are being identified.""

Residents of the rural area told The Associated Press they watched as some survivors were taken away in ambulances.

Video showed dark plumes of smoke billowing from the crash site. Several first responders were at the scene, including firefighters who could be seen spraying water on the smoldering remains.

The plane was rented from Blue Panorama by Cubana, which has taken many of its aging planes out of service in recent months due to mechanical problems.

Cubana is known by locals for consistently having delays and cancellations, which the airline attributes to a lack of airplanes and parts because of the American trade embargo on Cuba.

Friday's crash marked the third major deadly accident for Cuba since 2010.

"Former CIA Director John Brennan is a serious national security risk, and President Trump was wise and correct to revoke his security clearance Wednesday.

Brennan has repeatedly shown he cannot be trusted with classified or top-secret information. He has a history of leaking and exploiting confidential material for partisan reasons. Maybe it keeps him on TV, but it also jeopardizes national security.

The primary job of the agency Brennan ran for President Obama is to collect, process, and analyze intelligence information from all over the world. This valuable material is then utilized to protect Americans from harm.

However, Brennan has demonstrated that he is all too willing to use this information to harm Americans, including President Trump. He did so in the 2016 presidential election.

As I explain in Chapter 6 of my new book, “The Russia Hoax,” Brennan politicized and weaponized what was false intelligence to damage the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump.

Brennan surely knew that the anti-Trump “dossier” paid for by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign was nothing more than a preposterous collection of rumors, innuendo, supposition and wild speculation. He knew it was derived from multiple hearsay accounts from inherently unreliable and anonymous sources in Russia who specialize in lies and disinformation.

Yet Brennan did more than anyone to promulgate the fabricated and uncorroborated “dossier.”

The author of the document, former British spy Christopher Steele, was trained in deception and chicanery, and was inherently untrustworthy. Steele was on the record telling the U.S. Justice Department that he was “desperate that Donald Trump not get elected” and “passionate about his not being president.”

It is improper to use a discredited source with such severe and pervasive bias. Yet Brennan and his FBI counterparts didn’t care. Even after Steele was fired for lying, they continued to use him as a covert source in their illicit scheme to frame Trump for crimes he never committed.

Brennan was the instigator. By advocating the use of the “dossier,” he managed to orchestrate the investigation of Trump that was formally launched by FBI Director James Comey and his underlings, including Peter Strzok and Andrew McCabe. All three have since been fired for their egregious misconduct.

But it was Brennan who played a central role in promoting the fictitious Trump-Russia “collusion” narrative.

There is no good or legitimate reason for Brennan to maintain a security clearance. We expect CIA directors to be nonpartisan and apolitical. Brennan, always the devoted Clinton acolyte and sycophant, was not.

Brennan’s constant political and personal condemnation of President Trump only underscores his devious motivations for misusing classified information and disseminating false intelligence.

Consider this Brennan Twitter rant aimed at President Trump: “When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.”

Tired clichés aside, is this the kind of person who should have access to classified information during a Trump presidency – or any presidency?

Consider also the ominous warning issued by President Obama’s United Nations ambassador, Samantha Power: “Not a good idea to piss off John Brennan.”

The former CIA director is clearly capable of malevolent action. He should not be armed with the nation’s secrets to inflict even more damage than he has already wrought.

"President Donald Trump and his son-in-law scored a legislative victory Tuesday after the House overwhelmingly approved a prison reform bill that aims to help ex-convicts rebuild their lives after their release from prison.

The so-called First Step Act was authored by Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Doug Collins, R-Ga., who also worked closely with the White House -- particularly Jared Kushner, Trump’s senior adviser, who advocated for the reform after witnessing how his father, Charles Kushner, was treated in prison.

The act would provide $250 million over five years to expand and support programs that reduce reoffending rates and encourage good behavior, the New York Post reported.

It would also require prisoners to be housed within 500 miles from their relatives and prohibit prisons from shackling pregnant women. Some prisoners would also be allowed to spend more of their sentences in a halfway house or home confinement.

“President Trump promised to fight for the forgotten men and women of this country — and that includes those in prison.” - Jared Kushner, White House senior adviser

“President Trump promised to fight for the forgotten men and women of this country — and that includes those in prison,” Kushner wrote in the Wall Street Journal last month.

“America is a nation that believes in the power of redemption,” Trump said Friday at a prison reform summit at the White House. “America is a nation that believes in second chances, and third chances, in some cases. And, I don’t know, I guess even fourth chances.”

The reform effort earned support from multiple diverse groups, including Dream Corps’ #cut50 initiative – a movement led by CNN analyst Van Jones, a longtime critic of Trump, Mother Jones magazine reported.

But Jones’ support for the bill heralded by Kushner came under fire from progressive Democrats who oppose working with the Trump administration. ShareBlue media’s Oliver Willis accused Jones of aiding racism, tweeting: “Van provides window dressing so racist administration can point to their black friend without really doing anything.”

“Aiding Donald Trump is aiding racism. And Van Jones is aiding Trump (even worse he did a dog n pony show for Ivanka, Jared, and Rick Perry). It was gross and disgusting,” Willis added in another tweet, prompting mockery for opposing a reform that helps inmates.

Jeffries said his bill would give additional funding to programs that allow inmates to attend vocational and college courses and get help with mental health and substance abuse issues.

“These are individuals who are in the system right now without hope, without opportunity, without a meaningful chance at transforming themselves,” Jeffries said on the House floor. “And the First Step Act will provide that. … Why would we possibly refuse that?”

The bill now moves to the Senate where it will face a tough battle as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he wants any prison reform linked to sentencing reforms as well.",politics
"The White House says it is “deeply disturbing” that liberal New York gubernatorial candidate and former “Sex and the City” star Cynthia Nixon is referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency as a “terrorist organization.”

“It’s deeply disturbing that Cynthia Nixon has no clue of what ICE does to protect Americans and New Yorkers every day from dangerous criminals, terrorists, child smugglers and human traffickers,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement on Monday.

Nixon, who is attempting to position herself to the left of incumbent Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has repeatedly used the phrase to describe the federal government agency that enforces immigration laws.

Nixon, who has joined the liberal calls for the abolishment of ICE, recently tweeted: “I can think of no better description than to call ICE a terrorist organization.”

The White House said it’s ironic that Nixon is running for governor of New York.

“The 9/11 terrorists responsible for the slaughter of 3,000 innocent people were foreign nationals on visas who committed immigration fraud and who should have been deported,” Gidley said. “ICE was created in the aftermath of that tragedy to help ensure that no similar atrocity would ever strike our nation again.”

CYNTHIA NIXON CALLS ICE ‘TERRORIST ORGANIZATION’

Added Gidley, “It’s especially unfortunate that Nixon, as a New Yorker, not only advocates for the abolition of the very agency that would’ve helped stop 9/11, but also smears and slanders the tireless work carried out by the brave men and women of ICE to keep our country safe.”

According to a recent ICE press release, agents arrested 40 illegal immigrants in the state of New York last month, which included at-large criminal illegal immigrants, illegal re-entrants and other immigration violators.

Last month, at a church on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, Nixon said ICE “has strayed so far away from its mission.”

“It is supposed to be here to keep Americans safe, but what it has turned into, frankly, is a terrorist organization of its own that is terrorizing people who are coming to this country,” she said.

"Former President Bill Clinton argued Sunday that impeachment hearings would already be in full swing if a Democrat were in the Oval Office and if the special counsel’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election were as deep as it is now.

“I think if the roles were reversed — now, this is me just talking, but it’s based on my experience — if it were a Democratic president, and these facts were present, most people I know in Washington believe impeachment hearings would have begun already,” Clinton told “CBS Sunday Morning.”

Clinton, who appeared alongside James Patterson to promote the political thriller “The President is Missing” that the two penned together, noted that these are “serious issues” that the country is facing.

So far, the special counsel’s investigation, which is headed up by former FBI director Robert Mueller, has charged 19 people – including three former campaign aides of President Trump – along with three companies, and has received five guilty pleas. Perhaps the most high-profile of those guilty pleas came from Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Clinton, whose wife, Hillary, lost the 2016 election to Trump, is no stranger to impeachment hearings. After a lengthy investigation by independent counsel Ken Starr, the Republican-controlled House in 1998 voted to impeach Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice in relation to the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

Clinton, however, was acquitted of both the perjury and obstruction of justice charges when the impeachment trial went to the Senate.

During the interview with CBS, Clinton also blasted Trump for the president’s bombastic style and his use of nicknames to poke fun at political opponents. Trump labeled Florida Sen. Marco Rubio “Little Marco” and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz “Lyin’ Ted” during the 2016 campaign season, has referred to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as “little rocket man” and continues to refer to Clinton’s wife as “Crooked Hillary.”

“I don’t like all this. I couldn’t be elected anything now ​be​cause I just don’t like embarrassing people​,” Bill Clinton said. “My mother would have whipped me for five days in a row when I was a little boy if I spent all my time badmouthing people like this.”

While the former president said that the press would have been just as “hard, or harder” in covering a Democratic president, he did defend the media against Trump habit of labelling certain news outlets as “Fake News.”

“I think they have tried by and large to cover this investigation based on the facts,” Clinton said.",politics
"President Trump and his surrogates ramped up their pushback Wednesday against Watergate legend Bob Woodward’s upcoming book, “Fear,” which paints the White House as chaotic and filled with staffers overwhelmed by infighting and animosity.

Trump called the book ""total fiction,"" ""boring"" and ""untrue"" in a series of tweets on Wedneday. At the same time, he seemed to refer to the numerous anecdotes of him insulting those who work for him by explaining that he's ""tough as hell"" and that's how he gets things done.

“Almost everyone agrees that my Administration has done more in less than two years than any other Administration in the history of our Country,” Trump tweeted. “I’m tough as hell on people & if I weren’t, nothing would get done. Also, I question everybody & everything-which is why I got elected!”

Earlier on Wednesday, the president tweeted another jab at Woodward, “Isn’t it a shame that someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost. Don’t know why Washington politicians don’t change libel laws?”

An early copy of The Washington Post associate editor’s book was obtained by The Washington Post. According to the Post, it portrays a Trump White House that’s filled with staffers second-guessing the president and bad-mouthing him behind closed doors.

“This book is nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the President look bad,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and ex-Trump attorney John Dowd have also refuted portions of the book, while White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shaj said that some people referenced in the details “have raised questions about the veracity of things that are being reported.”

One section claimed John Kelly described Trump as “an idiot.”

“It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in Crazytown,” Kelly said, according to Woodward. “I don’t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I’ve ever had.”

On Tuesday, Kelly said that the account was false.

According to the book, Trump also allegedly called Attorney General Jeff Sessions a “traitor” for recusing himself from overseeing the Russia probe.

“This guy is mentally retarded. He’s this dumb Southerner. … He couldn’t even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama,” Trump reportedly said.

Trump was not interviewed for the book, despite what Woodward said were repeated attempts to contact him. Trump called Woodward in August and told him that his staff hadn’t informed him of the request and expressed concern that the book would be “inaccurate.”

The Post reported that Trump is “furious” about the book and is hesitant to trust people around him. He is reportedly “frustrated’ with counselor Kellyanne Conway because she didn’t arrange an interview between the president and Woodward – as he feels he could have helped shape the book in a more positive light, according to the Post.

“The president urged senior White House aides and Cabinet members to speak up if they disagreed with how they were quoted in the book,” Post reporters Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey wrote.

The Post published a transcript of a phone call that Trump had with Woodward on Aug. 14, 2018 – after the book was finished. Woodward told the president he asked “about six people,” including Conway, to arrange an interview with Trump for the book to no avail.

“They didn’t tell me,” Trump told Woodward. “It’s really too bad… I would have loved to have spoken to you.”

Trump has attacked a handful of unflattering books in recent months, such as Michael Wollf’s “Fire and Fury” and Omarosa Manigault-Newman’s “Unhinged,” but Woodward brings a new level of credibility to the situation.

Once backlash started pouring in, Woodward offered a brief statement to the Post: “I stand by my reporting.”

Woodward’s “Fear” is to be released on Sept. 11.

"A U.S. service member was killed and another was wounded during an apparent ""insider attack"" in eastern Afghanistan on Monday, according to a statement from U.S. Forces Afghanistan.

It's the second time in two months that a U.S. service member was killed apparently by the very same Afghan forces he was there to train. Six U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan this year.

""The sacrifice of our service member, who volunteered for a mission to Afghanistan to protect his country, is a tragic loss for all who knew and all who will now never know him,"" Resolute Support and U.S. Forces Afghanistan Commanding General Scott Miller said in a statement. ""Our duty now is to honor him, care for his family and continue our mission.""

The service member who was wounded in the attack is in stable condition, U.S. Forces Afghanistan said. The name of the fallen service member will be released ""24 hours after next of kin notification,"" officials added.

The death came one day after a new U.S. commander for all American and allied forces in Afghanistan took over. The commander, Gen. Scott Miller, is the former head of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), responsible for leading elite commando units such as the Army’s Delta Force, SEAL Team Six and the 75th Ranger Regiment.

""The world recognizes Afghanistan cannot be a safe haven for terrorism. The world recognizes we cannot fail. I know this has been a long fight, and it has been generations for us, for the Afghan people. I understand the reason we are fighting, and I know why we are here, and I know terrorists seek safe haven to export murder,"" Miller said as he assumed command.

Britain's defense minister echoed that point on a recent visit to Afghanistan -- as he warned of the ever-growing threat from the Islamic State. ""We are seeing that terrorist groups operating here in Afghanistan, evidence of their links back not just to the United Kingdom but to the whole of continental Europe,"" British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said during the recent visit.

Some 15,000 American troops remain in Afghanistan, down from a high over 100,000 during the Obama administration.

Last week, the U.S. military's top officer said the reduction marked a new strategy put in place by President Trump a year ago.

""I certainly don't expect that the current forces that we have in Afghanistan represents an enduring large military commitment,"" Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last week during a briefing with reporters at the Pentagon.

The Pentagon said Sunday it killed the head of ISIS in Afghanistan in a drone strike late last month.

"UK Members of Parliament clashed Monday in a heated debate over President Trump’s state visit as left-wing MPs called for the invitation to be withdrawn -- while some Conservative Party MPs accused their opponents of hypocrisy and insulting the American people.

Prime Minister Theresa May extended a state visit invitation to Trump when she visited the White House in January – a move that angered some segments of the UK population and left-leaning lawmakers, who have pointed to Trump’s language about women and his hardline stance on refugees and immigrants as reasons to oppose such a visit.

The debate in Parliament’s Westminster Hall was triggered after an online parliamentary petition seeking to prevent Trump from making a state visit to the U.K. picked up 1.8 million signatures. A counter-petition picked up over 300,000 signatures. The debate coincided with anti-Trump demonstrations in major UK cities.

While a visit to the U.K. was always likely, a state visit differs from an official visit as it is hosted by Queen Elizabeth II, and therefore is filled with pomp and ceremony, often involving a carriage ride with the Queen, a state banquet and an address to both Houses of Parliament.

Only two presidents – George W. Bush and Barack Obama – have been afforded state visits during Elizabeth’s reign. The petition claims that Trump’s “misogyny and vulgarity” would mean the visit would embarrass the monarch.

During the debate, left-wing MPs from the Labour Party, Green Party and Scottish National Party tore into the Republican president, accusing him of racism, sexism and xenophobia, and blasted May for extending the invitation in the first place.

“It is difficult to know whether to be appalled at the morality of this invitation or just astonished at the stupidity of the invitation,” said SNP MP Alex Salmond, who called May’s outreach “stomach-churning.”

UK SPEAKER BERCOW MOCKED, CALLED A HYPOCRITE OVER TRUMP SNUB

Green Party MP Caroline Lucas added that Trump had “shown such effrontery to basic climate science” in his views on climate change.

“It’s extraordinary that Trump, from the cavernous depths of his scientific ignorance, is prepared to challenge the conclusions of 97 percent of the world’s experts on this matter,” agreed Labour Party MP Paul Flynn, who later described Trump as a “petulant child” for his behavior.

However, Conservative Party MPs were united in the fact that the visit should go ahead, despite some of their own personal misgivings about some of the things he has said or done.

Nigel Evans, in a passionate speech, compared Trump’s election to the British vote to leave the European Union, and argued that the American voter should be respected.

“Just like we had the forgotten people in the United Kingdom, there are the forgotten people of the United States of America. They’re the ones who packed that stadium on Saturday to cheer Donald Trump after his month in the presidency because actually they like what he says,” he said.

“There are 61 million people who voted for Donald Trump and when we stand up in this country and then condemn him for being racist – and I’ve seen no evidence of that – or they attack him an unseemly way, we’re actually attacking the American people,” he said.

Other Tories accused their opposition colleagues of hypocrisy, considering that leaders with sketchy human rights records have been afforded state visits. When Flynn mentioned Trump’s infamous 2005 “grab them by the p***y” remark, Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg took him to task.

“I am grateful to the honorable gentleman for giving way and for his response to Mr. Trump’s perhaps ill-considered phraseology, but what complaint did the honorable gentleman make when [Japanese] Emperor Hirohito came here, who was responsible for the Rape of Nanking?” he asked.

“[Chinese President] Xi Jinping was here last year, where were the demonstrations then? How many votes did Xi Jinping get? We had a state visit from a Chinese leader 10 years after Tiananmen square,” added Evans. “It’s double standards.”

James Cartlidge, meanwhile, warned that rescinding the invitation would make Britain “a laughing stock” and would only benefit Russia.

“There will be smiles all around in the Kremlin if we follow this petition because what they want in the Kremlin above all else is to divide the West,” he warned.

There was no vote at the end of the debate, and ultimately it is up to the British Government whether to withdraw the invitation, or downgrade the visit. It seems highly unlikely that, now extended, the government would retract the invitation.

The government had responded to the petition saying “HM Government believes the President of the United States should be extended the full courtesy of a state visit. We look forward to welcoming President Trump once dates and arrangements are finalized,” the statement said.

House of Commons Speaker John Bercow caused controversy earlier this month when he broke with a tradition of neutrality by saying that he was opposed to Trump addressing both Houses of Parliament during his visit. The comments sparked a backlash, as well as a motion of no-confidence tabled against him.

"As the Democratic Party struggles to find its identity this primary season, it’s clear that Tuesday’s contests continued to show the internal struggle for the party’s future direction.

The results speak volumes: progressives are overwhelmingly beating their more moderate primary opponents and uncertainty remains around the Democratic Party’s ability to retake the House in November

The growing progressive insurgency presents serious questions for the Democratic Party as it continues its leftward movement.

CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE MIDTERM ELECTION COVERAGE

Progressives are overwhelmingly beating their more moderate primary opponents and uncertainty remains around the Democratic Party’s ability to retake the House in November.

In particular, two gubernatorial primaries demonstrated the tension between progressives and moderate candidates who are arguably more electable in November.

In Georgia, former state House Minority Leader and staunch progressive Stacey Abrams defeated moderate former State Rep. Stacey Evans by an overwhelming margin of 74 percent to 26 percent.

Abrams, who is now one step closer to becoming the nation’s first African-American female governor, notably received an endorsement from former presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who recorded a robocall on her behalf.

Abrams is also backed by independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton’s rival for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, along with his progressive super PAC, Our Revolution.

On the Republican side in the race for governor of Georgia, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Secretary of State Brian Kemp advanced to compete against each other in a July 24 runoff. They were the two finishers in a field of six Republican candidates.

Moving west, Texas’ gubernatorial race also showed signs of the Democratic base favoring a progressive over a moderate. Progressive Lupe Valdez, the state’s first Latina sheriff, defeated moderate Andrew White, who was known for his appeal to suburban voters and personal opposition to abortion.

In terms of congressional primaries, Georgia’s 6th District in suburban Atlanta – where Republican Karen Handel won last year in a special election that was the most expensive in House race in history – will see a Democratic runoff in June to compete against her in November. Moderate former TV news anchor Bobby Kaple, who supports prudent changes to the Affordable Care Act, will face community activist Lucy McBath, a proponent of gun control and the mother of a son who was shot and killed.

Another primary pitting moderate and progressive Democrats against one another played out in Kentucky’s Lexington-based 6th District, where has been held by Republicans since 2012. The national party recruited Lexington Mayor Jim Gray to run for the Democratic nomination, but Marine Corps veteran and first-time candidate Amy McGrath won by a considerable margin

In November, McGrath will face three-term incumbent Republican Rep. Andy Barr, who most recently won reelection in 2016 by more than 20 points.

There were, however, three consequential elections in which moderate Democratic candidates prevailed. These elections, all in Texas, took place in three of Texas’ 23 Republican-held congressional districts where Hillary Clinton beat President Trump in 2016.

Perhaps the most critical race that epitomized the growing civil war within the Democratic Party between moderates and the emboldened progressive faction took place in Texas’ 7th District in the Houston suburbs. Moderate Democrat and former attorney Lizzie Panill Fletcher defeated Our Revolution-endorsed progressive Laura Moser.

Despite controversy surrounding the involvement of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) in this race and its decision to release opposition research against Moser, Fletcher overcame the insurgent Moser and will now face potentially vulnerable Republican incumbent John Culberson in November.

In Texas’s 23rd District, occupying a large swath of west Texas along the U.S.-Mexican border, DCCC-endorsed Gina Ortiz Jones beat out the severely underfunded Rick Trevino, an activist and former Bernie Sanders delegate backed by the Sanders-affiliated group Our Revolution.

Ortiz Jones, an Iraq War veteran and Obama administration alumna, will now face Republican Rep. Will Hurd in November.

Texas’ 32nd District in the northern suburbs of Dallas also represented a win for a moderate, former Obama administration official. Colin Allred, a DCCC-endorsed former NFL player and Department of Housing and Urban Development attorney, emerged victorious over a more progressive primary opponent Lillian Salerno. He will face incumbent Republican Rep. Pete Sessions in November.

Overall, Tuesday’s results prove that the problematic trend of far-left progressives winning Democratic primaries over moderate centrists continues, showing that the party is more divided than ever.

It is time to move forward with a plan that unifies, rather than divides the party, or squander the opportunity to retake either chamber of Congress in November.",politics
"The U.S. Navy recently intercepted a large cache of small arms, including hundreds of AK-47s, that were on a ship in the Gulf of Aden earlier this week, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News on Wednesday.

Sailors from the destroyer USS Jason Dunham boarded the ship and made the seizure. The incident was first reported by CNN.

U.S. officials have not disclosed from where the weapons shipment originated.

IRAN CLAIMS IT CONTROLS STRAIT OF HORMUZ, PROMPTING POMPEO DENIAL

The Gulf of Aden connects the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean via the narrow Bab al-Madeb strait. Last month, Saudi Arabia's state oil company temporarily suspended oil shipments through the strait after Iran-backed Shiite rebels in Yemen fired on two oil tankers, damaging one of them.

The shipments were resumed earlier this month after the Saudi energy minister vowed that the Riyadh-led coalition in Yemen's civil war had taken ""necessary measures"" to secure the shipments.

"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “the single best legal mind of his generation,” adding he's certain the judge “is going to be on the Supreme Court.”

Graham told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum that Trump was the “big winner” in Wednesday’s hearing and that Democrats were the “big losers.” He said that Republicans have voted in favor of certain liberal judges in the past when the party was in the minority -- but he claimed Democrats have been unwilling to do the same.

“I think the country is tired of the yelling and they’d like us to get things done. And, at times, Donald Trump drives me crazy, but he’s produced, and Kavanaugh is the single best legal mind of his generation. Any Republican president would’ve picked him.”

BRETT KAVANAUGH VOWS TO ‘KEEP AN OPEN MIND IN EVERY CASE,’ AFTER CHAOTIC CONFIMATION HEARING

Graham went on to say that Kavanaugh is “equally qualified if not more” qualified than Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan, both of whom were approved for the high court during the Obama administration.

He also said on “The Story” that the hearings will reflect poorly on Dems, adding: “If this is their approach to how to govern, they're going to have a hard time in 2020.”

Graham seemed to be confident that Kavanaugh would be approved.

“Kavanaugh’s going to be on the Supreme Court. Well done, Mr. President.”

Graham also spoke about the recent loss of his close friend Sen. John McCain -- and the man picked to serve out the remainder of his term.

“They’ve taken John’s wingman, John Kyl, who's steady as a rock, solid conservative who tries to solve hard problems and let him finish out his good friend’s term and it makes a lot of sense to me and come January we’ll get somebody that will be able to run in 2020.”

ACTRESS PIPER PERABO ARRESTED, THROWN OUT OF KAVANAUGH HEARING AFTER LAUNCHING PROTEST

He also added that Kyl, a former Arizona senator, is “a vote for Kavanaugh.”

MaCallum briefly asked Graham about the New York Times report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was willing to accept some written answers from Trump about Russian collusion accusations.

He said it seemed unlikely Mueller's team would produce a report before midterm elections.

“If their still negotiating, talking to the president, most likely you won’t get a report until after the election.”

Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings started Tuesday and are set to continue through the week.

"A South African woman, who was pronounced dead at the scene of a car crash, was reportedly found alive inside a morgue fridge.

A worker made the discovery after he went to check on the body and noticed the woman was breathing, according to the BBC.

Paramedics pronounced the woman – who has not been identified – dead at the scene of a car crash that killed two others on June 24, with the ambulance company claiming she showed “no form of life,” Times Live reported.

The woman has been transported to a hospital where she is recovering, according to the BBC. An investigation is underway as family members are demanding how such a crucial oversight could happen.

“The issue is that we need answers, that's all we want and we don't have any clarity now,"" a family member told the BBC.

The manager of the ambulance company told the Times Live that the incident wasn’t a fault of the paramedics being improperly trained and that there was “no proof of any negligence"" on the company’s part.

Over the past decade, South Africa has had several similar instances involving people being misidentified as dead, only to be found alive and well inside a morgue refrigerator, according to the BBC.",world
"As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago.

The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare.

Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement.

“He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

That’s a thumbs-down that still comes up on the campaign trail, as President Trump stumps for GOP candidates.

“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June.

But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless.

“We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”

There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases.

“We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C. Goodman, president of the Goodman Institute. “Since the beginning premiums in individual markets have doubled and tripled in most places.”

"Voters are increasingly divided over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court since President Trump announced him as his choice to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy.

Forty-five percent would confirm Kavanaugh, while 46 percent oppose him, according to the latest Fox News poll.

Last month, voters supported him by a 38-32 percent margin. Many voters at that time, 30 percent, had no opinion on Kavanaugh’s nomination. That makes sense, given interviews for the July poll were conducted July 10-11, which was soon after the president’s July 9 prime-time announcement of his selection.

READ THE COMPLETE POLL RESULTS.

Since July, support for Kavanaugh is up 15 points among Republicans (was 70, now 85 percent), while opposition among Democrats is up 20 points (was 58, now 78 percent).

There’s a gender gap too, as men (53 percent) are 15 points more likely than women (38 percent) to support his confirmation.

Many other nominees received similar mixed support. For example, voters backed the confirmation of President Trump’s first nominee Neil Gorsuch by a 45-39 percent margin (March 2017), and former President Obama’s second nominee Elena Kagan by 38-36 percent (June 2010). In addition, trend going back to 2005 shows that only two nominees garnered majority support: John Roberts received 51 percent support in July 2005 and Sonya Sotomayor got 53 percent in July 2009.

The new survey, released Thursday, also finds voters split over whether Senate Democrats should do “everything they can” to block any of President Trump’s Supreme Court nominees: 45 percent say yes, while 42 percent disagree. Among Democrats, 75 percent think their party’s leaders should do everything they can to oppose Trump nominees.

On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer requested a delay in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Kavanaugh’s nomination, stating: “Kavanaugh’s refusal to say that a president must comply with a duly issued subpoena, and Michael Cohen’s implication of the president in a federal crime, makes the danger of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court abundantly clear. It’s a game changer. Should be.”

Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty Tuesday to campaign-finance violations and other charges.

When the president revealed his selection of Kavanaugh in July, Senate Democrats called for delaying the vote on his nomination until after November’s midterm elections. According to polling conducted at that time, voters disagree with that, saying the Senate should vote before the midterms by a 50-42 percent margin.

The Senate is scheduled to begin Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings September 4.

Pollpourri

More voters view Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer negatively than positively by 14 points (28 favorable vs. 42 unfavorable). Other leaders fare even worse. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is viewed more negatively by 25 points (29-54 percent), House Speaker Paul Ryan is underwater by 20 points (31-51 percent), and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has a net negative of minus 30 (22-52 percent).

For comparison, voters rate Trump negatively by 16 points (41 favorable vs. 57 unfavorable).

Nearly half of voters, 46 percent, have a “strongly” unfavorable opinion of Trump. The next highest on that measure? Pelosi, at 35 percent “strongly” unfavorable.

Among the party faithful, Trump does best. Among Republicans, 83 percent have a favorable view, while Ryan comes in at 57 percent and McConnell 36 percent. Among Democrats, 46 percent have a favorable opinion of Pelosi and 39 percent of Schumer.

Voters view the Democratic Party more positively than the Republican Party.

Opinion of the GOP is upside down by 17 points (39 favorable vs. 56 unfavorable), while the Democratic Party is rated positively by 4 points (50 favorable vs. 46 unfavorable).

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,009 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from August 19-21, 2018.

"Temple University's Students for Justice in Palestine last week held an anti-Israel event that featured readings from the leader of a U.S.-designated terrorist group.

SJP and the Saturday Free School co-hosted the event, ""Palestine & Black America: A Strategy for Liberation"", which highlighted works from Ahmad Sa'adat, the secretary-general of the Popular Front of the Liberation of Palestine, according to the Algemeiner.

Sa'adat is currently serving a 30-year sentence in an Israeli prison.

The event also praised Sa’adat’s predecessor, George Habash, who described the “partitioning of Asia and Africa as the driving motive behind the creation of Israel.”

Brandon Do read an article he wrote which called Israel a “weapon of neo-colonialism” and said the Palestinian Authority is really “a Zionist front with an Arab face whose purpose is to carry out the work of Israel.”

“Today when we see the ravages of US imperialism, the threats of Trump against the world, and the shooting down of black people on US streets by cops…liberation struggles are criminalized and labeled as terrorist,” he said.

During a discussion portion of the event, one attendee noted that “black America” and the Palestinians share the same enemies in the United States and Israel.

“When do we organize ourselves to combat the Zionist strategies to recruit people of color to be their cover to make excuses for Zionism?” another attendee asked, as she brought up the example of Dumisani Washington, the Diversity Outreach Director for Christians United for Israel.

A Jewish attendee, who identified himself as a “neo-Zionist” said he disagreed with their notion of Jewish people and said “it’s a lot more complicated that maybe you want it to be.”

Another attendee said he won’t use the word “Israel” because it doesn’t exist in his mind. He added that they need to take their Marxist ideology and rebrand it if they want to appeal to the masses.

"John Brennan, the former CIA director and outspoken critic of President Trump, said in an interview Sunday that he is willing to do whatever he can to prevent others from having their security clearances revoked, including taking the president to court.

Brennan, who was on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” said lawyers have approached him on the issue and spoke about obtaining an injunction to prevent more security clearances being revoked.

""If my clearances and my reputation as I'm being pulled through the mud now, if that's the price we're going to pay to prevent Donald Trump from doing this against other people, to me it's a small price to pay,"" Brennan said. ""So I am going to do whatever I can personally to try to prevent these abuses in the future. And if it means going to court, I will do that.""

Brennan, who served in President Obama's administration, said it is up to Congress to put aside politics and step in. ""This is the time that your country is going to rely on you, not to do what is best for your party but what is best for the country,"" he said.

An executive order signed in 1995 by President Bill Clinton lays out the process for approving security clearances and describes a detailed revocation and appeal procedure. The Washington Post reported that four million Americans have some form of security clearances.

Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., criticized Brennan's political comments on “Fox News Sunday,” but suggested an alternative to yanking his clearance.

""John Brennan really did cross the line. He's one of the leaders of the resistance movement. ... I understand President Trump's frustration,"" Johnson said, noting that Brennan began harshly criticizing the president as soon as he took office. ""The best way of handling this, in any administration, is: If you don’t want to consult with somebody, you don’t necessarily have to yank their security clearance, just don’t give them access to the classified material.""

"Vox and ProPublica are taking heat for producing a video downplaying the threat posed by MS-13 and describing the gang as a strictly “American problem.”

The ruthless gang has been in the headlines for years, but has become somewhat of a political football as President Trump makes them the face of the illegal immigration problem.

The video by Vox and ProPublica openly challenges Trump for using the gang as justification for tougher border policies. But conservative critics are accusing the reporters of going over the line, and acting as apologists for MS-13.

“The left is so committed to being anti-Trump that they are willing to play the role of Baghdad Bob for one of the most vicious gangs in America. If you find yourself doing pro-bono PR work for rapists and murderers you might want to rethink your entire life,” conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News.

The video, “Why the street gang MS-13 is an American problem,” acknowledges the gang has committed terrible crimes but goes on to downplay the threat.

It portrays MS-13 members as otherwise regular teens who take selfies and stresses that the gang was formed by immigrants from El Salvador in Los Angeles, claiming this renders it an American issue.

The video features ProPublica reporter Hannah Dreier saying that the MS-13 she sees on the ground has “almost nothing in common with the MS-13 as portrayed by the government,” before airing footage of Trump attacking the gang at a rally.

Dreier then says the MS-13 members she has come across are “working after-school jobs, living with their parents” and get around Long Island on bicycles “because they can’t afford cars.”

Vox senior reporter Dara Lind says in the video it is “100 percent an American-born gang.” Lind describes its early members in Los Angeles as “a group of teenagers hanging out, smoking pot, listening to rock music.”

The video stresses that MS-13 is not a drug cartel, has fewer members than other gangs like The Crips and is not ""highly organized."" The video concludes by stating that “MS-13 is not invading” the United States.

The gang indeed was formed in Los Angeles, and its U.S. membership is lower than that of some other gangs. The video, however, glosses over the gang's strong presence in Central America, which grew after deportations from the U.S. in the 1990s, as detailed by The Council on Foreign Relations.

Former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Thomas Homan blasted the video during an interview Friday on ""Fox & Friends.""

“I’ve been investigating illegal alien crime for 34 years. I’ve flown to New York twice with the president, to Long Island where he met with the families of children [killed by MS-13],” Homan said. “The president is 100 percent accurate. MS-13 is a border issue.”

Homan said the video is “dead wrong” and he was never contacted for it.

“They don’t want to reach out to me … the left side media, they don’t want to hear it from us. They don’t want the truth,” he said. “This is an inaccurate story.”

The Federalists’ Jacob Perry wrote that the video serves as a “public relations firm for the violent gang,” while downplaying the brutal gang “in order to attack President Trump.”

Trump has often pointed to MS-13 crimes to underscore the reason for some of his controversial immigration policies. He kicked off the immigration portion of his January State of the Union address by detailing the horror of two teenage girls who were killed by MS-13.

Immediately afterward, MSNBC's Joy Reid and Chris Matthews downplayed the gang and accused the president of mentioning the murders to get applause.

A study by the conservative-leaning Center for Immigration Studies released shortly after Trump’s speech found that MS-13 “represents a very serious threat to public safety” and the gang’s resurgence is “directly connected to the illegal arrival and resettlement of more than 300,000 Central American youths and families.”

The CIS report notes that all criminal gangs are threats ""but MS-13 is a unique problem because of the unusually brutal crimes its members have committed,” including 207 murders since 2012. Suffolk County District Attorney Timothy Sini recently appeared on Fox News' “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and described a quadruple homicide in which MS-13 members chopped four boys into “little pieces.”

ProPublica editor-in-chief Stephen Engelberg provided Fox News with the following comment: “Our video clearly notes that the people pictured in its opening segment have been charged with horrific crimes. The point of our reporting on MS-13 is to bring facts to the conversation. We are explaining the actual size of the gang, the actual scope of their criminal activities, and the actual extent to which they pose a threat to the immigrant communities in which they live — so that law enforcement can take appropriate actions that make these communities safer.”

The Latest on the conviction of two Reuters reporter in Myanmar for illegally possessing official documents (all times local):

2 p.m.

Britain's ambassador says the verdict against two Reuters journalists has undermined media freedom in Myanmar.

Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were convicted Monday of violating a colonial-era secrecy law and sentenced to seven years in prison. They were arrested while reporting on Myanmar's brutal crackdown on Rohingya Muslims.

British Ambassador Dan Chugg, who was in court for Monday's verdict, said the case has ""struck a hammer-blow to the rule of law in Myanmar.""

He said diplomats who attended the trial believe the judges ignored evidence and Myanmar's laws. The journalists testified they did not solicit or knowingly possess any secret documents, and a police officer who testified his commander had ordered documents be planted on the journalists was subsequently jailed for a year.

Chugg called for the journalists' release.

In a statement, the U.S. Embassy in Yangon said ""the clear flaws in this case raise serious concerns about rule of law and judicial independence in Myanmar, and the reporters' conviction is a major setback to the Government of Myanmar's stated goal of expanding democratic freedoms.""

10:40 a.m.

A court in Myanmar has sentenced two Reuters journalists to seven years in prison for illegal possession of official documents, a ruling that comes as international criticism mounts over the military's alleged human rights abuses against Rohingya Muslims.

Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had pleaded not guilty to violating the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. They contended they were framed by police.

Monday's verdict was postponed from a week ago.

The two journalists had been reporting last year on Myanmar's brutal crackdown against the Rohingya in the country's western state of Rakhine.

"Judge T.S. Ellis III mysteriously delayed testimony in the case of ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort for five hours on Friday, pushing off the day's proceedings as prosecutors once again complained about his criticism of them.

Later Friday afternoon, hours after proceedings were supposed to start, Ellis gaveled back in and called for the next witness to take the stand. He did not explain the delay.

The postponement was significant, as prosecutors had been hoping to finish calling witnesses Friday -- and Ellis has a reputation as a stickler for keeping trials moving.

It’s not clear if the delay was connected to the complaint filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team. Earlier, Ellis empathically reminded the jury that they must refrain from talking about the case with others – stoking speculation the delay could be related instead to juror issues.

Ellis, meanwhile, did not address the Mueller team's motion, either, when the trial resumed.

In the motion filed Friday morning, they accused the judge of unfairly criticizing them in court, saying it’s possible his recent comments could “confuse and mislead the jury.”

Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann and other attorneys on the team specifically noted how Ellis made negative comments this week about their focus on a bank loan Manafort applied for but did not receive.

“You might want to spend time on a loan that was granted,” Ellis said in court Thursday.

The prosecutors, in Friday's motion, asked Ellis to retract his comment, saying it “misrepresents the law regarding bank fraud conspiracy” and “improperly conveys the Court’s opinion of the facts, and is likely to confuse and mislead the jury.”

MUELLER TEAM FILES COMPLAINT AGAINST MANAFORT JUDGE OVER LATEST REPRIMAND

Manafort is accused of committing tax and bank fraud with millions made through political work in Ukraine. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

On Friday, Dennis Raico of the Chicago-based Federal Savings bank testified, under immunity. Raico said one of his bosses, CEO Stephen Calk, took great interst in the Manafort loan and was instrumental in the loan being approved. Calk, Raico said, was interested in a Cabinet position in the Trump administration.

On Thursday, Ellis expressed regret after prosecutors filed a similar motion complaining Ellis unfairly reprimanded them in front of the jury over allowing a witness sit in the courtroom before his testimony.

“This robe doesn’t make me anything other than human,” Ellis said.

That truce between the judge and prosecutors, though, did not last long.

Hours later, when prosecutors tried to introduce an exhibit that was dozens of pages long, Ellis interjected: ""There might be some kind soul on the jury who thinks they need to leaf through all this stuff -- and it isn't true.""

And then, Ellis instructed the Mueller team to try and focus their questions, before joking prosecutors aren’t familiar with their own exhibits after they asked for a minute to pull out a piece of paper.

Ellis has a reputation for making colorful comments – and being tough on the prosecution.

On Wednesday, Ellis explained that he would not ask the defense to reveal as much information as he has demanded from the prosecution because “it’s sort of like poker -- you don’t have to show your hand until you’re called.”

“Something like that, I’m not a poker player,” Ellis said.

Earlier this week, Ellis seemed to accuse Greg Andres, the prosecutor, of crying in his courtroom.

“I understand how frustrated you are. In fact, there’s tears in your eyes right now,” Ellis said Monday, according to a Bloomberg-obtained transcript.

When Andres denied Ellis’ claim, the judge said, “Well, they’re watery.”

Earlier this week, the prosecution’s star witness, Rick Gates – who struck a plea deal to cooperate with the government -- testified that he and Manafort committed bank and tax fraud together.

The prosecution had been expected to wrap up its case by Friday afternoon. It’s unclear how Friday’s delay will affect that.

"It pays to become a Trump nemesis.

Consider what now has become a familiar routine: get into a highly publicized media battle with President Trump, set up an online crowdfunding campaign for your legal defense and watch hundreds of thousands pour into your bank account from the anti-Trump “resistance.”

Since April, according to a review by Fox News, more than $1.7 million has been donated through crowdfunding campaigns like GoFundMe to former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, fired FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, fired FBI agent Peter Strzok and adult film star Stormy Daniels.

The latest effort comes from Cohen, Trump’s longtime personal lawyer who turned on the president this week, to the delight of Trump’s critics. In a plea deal with prosecutors, Cohen admitted to violating federal campaign finance laws by arranging hush money payments to two women allegedly at the direction of then-candidate Trump during the 2016 race.

Money raised online by Trump foes, as of Aug. 23 Michael Cohen: $136,221 Andrew McCabe: $554,000 Peter Strzok: $443,170 Stormy Daniels: $585,563 TOTAL= $1,718,954

His attorney, Lanny Davis, on Tuesday set up a legal defense fund for Cohen on GoFundMe with a goal of raising $500,000. As of Thursday morning, Cohen’s fund had raised more than $136,000.

“The Michael Cohen Truth Fund is a transparent trust account, with all donations going to help Michael Cohen and his family as he goes forward on his journey to tell the truth about Donald Trump,” the fundraising page says.

Some critics, though, have found the blatant request for donations to be icky.

The live audience mockingly laughed when Davis, during a Wednesday appearance on Megyn Kelly’s television show on NBC, asked people to donate so Cohen “can continue to tell the truth.”

“I don’t know if they’re ready to donate, Lanny,” Kelly replied, as the laughter faded.

Others – including those who are no fans of Trump – have criticized the GoFundMe campaigns as opportunistic.

Last week, ""Daily Show"" host Trevor Noah took aim at the GoFundMe page for Strzok, who was fired from the FBI after the revelation of numerous anti-Trump text messages while he was involved in the bureau’s Hillary Clinton and Russia probes. As of Thursday, Strzok’s crowdfunding page indicates that he’s raised $443,170 out of a $500,000 goal.

""Because seriously, half a million dollars on a GoFundMe just for hating Donald Trump!” Noah said. “There are cancer patients on that site that are like, ‘Hey! We hate him too, can you help me pay for my treatment?'""

""Daily Show"" correspondent Michael Kosta added: ""I get it. People are desperate for something that can hurt Trump even a little bit. But that's how scams work, by preying on the most desperate.""

The first to really embrace this fundraising strategy was McCabe, who was fired from the FBI in March after the DOJ’s inspector general determined McCabe was not truthful during his review of the Clinton email investigation and the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility recommended his firing.

McCabe was fired just days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension. He countered that he was unfairly singled out by the administration, and punished for what he knows about James Comey's firing.

A GoFundMe campaign set up to cover legal expenses far exceeded its goal, raising about $554,000. Organizers ended the campaign, having raised more than anticipated.

TREVOR NOAH TEARS APART PETER STRZOK'S OPPORTUNISTIC GOFUNDME CAMPAIGN

“The donations have more than tripled the original goal, which is nothing short of astonishing,” McCabe spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said in April.

Stormy Daniels, the porn star who says she was paid off during the 2016 by Cohen to keep quiet about a past sexual encounter with Trump, has raised more than a half-million dollars in her crowdfunding campaign.

“I am attempting to speak honestly and openly to the American people about my relationship with now President Donald Trump and the intimidation and tactics used against me,” Daniels says on the fundraising site.

Cohen's plea deal, and other documents, supported her claim that she was paid hush money.

Some former Trump associates, ensnarled in Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, have also set up defense funds. Supporters of Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, have set up a website to raise money for his legal defense. But that site doesn’t list how much was raised.

There have been some hiccups in the crowdfunding efforts: Davis, the attorney for Cohen, on Wednesday mistakenly promoted “michaelcohentruth.com” as the place where supporters could donate to his client's legal fund -- but a Trump supporter apparently swooped up that domain first.

It now redirects to Trump’s campaign website donaldjtrump.com, which urges visitors to contribute to re-elect the president and ""Make America Great Again.""

"New York Republican Rep. Christopher Collins has been indicted on insider trading charges, federal prosecutors announced Wednesday.

""These charges are a reminder that this is a land of laws and that everyone stands before the bar of justice,"" Geoffrey Berman, an attorney for the U.S. Southern District of New York, said during a press conference on Wednesday.

The indictment also names the congressman's son, Cameron Collins, and Stephen Zarsky, the father of his son’s fiancée. The fraud counts relate to securities of an Australian biotechnology company called Innate Immunotherapeutics, where the 68-year-old congressman served on the board.

""Christopher Collins, the defendent, violated the duties he owed to Innate by passing material; nonpublic information regarding the Drug Trial results to his son, Cameron Collins, the defendent, so that [his son] could use that information to make timely trades in Innate stock and tip others,"" the indictment states. ""Cameron Collins traded on the inside information and passed it to Stephen Zarsky.""

Among the charges, the defendants are accused of multiple counts of securities fraud, along with one count of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count each of making false statements.

All three pleaded not guilty in court Wednesday afternoon.

Prosecutors allege that Collins passed along secrets to his son, Cameron, in June 2017. They say the son traded on the inside information and passed it to Zarsky. They added that Zarsky traded on it and tipped off at least three others.

According to the indictment, Collins specifically got early word that a drug the company developed to treat multiple sclerosis wasn't performing well in a medical trial and passed on the tip to his son.

Prosecutors said the three avoided over $768,000 in losses by trading ahead of the public announcement of the failed drug trials.

The advocacy group Public Citizen filed a request for an investigation of Collins' stock dealings with the Office of Congressional Ethics and the Securities and Exchange Commission in January of 2017.

The Republican congressman, who has served New York's 27th District since 2013, surrendered to federal agents in Manhattan on Wednesday morning and is expected to appear in federal court in lower Manhattan later in the day.

Attorneys representing Collins released the following statement on Wednesday: ""We will answer the charges filed against Congressman Collins in Court and will mount a vigorous defense to clear his good name. It is notable that even the government does not allege that Congressman Collins traded a single share of Innate Therapeutics stock. We are confident he will be completely vindicated and exonerated.""

In 2017, the House Ethics Committee probed the congressman at the behest of the late Rep. Louise Slaughter. She authored the STOCK Act, which barred lawmakers and aides from using propietary information to trade securities.

The Ethics Committee report on Collins was muddled. It did not punish Collins. But it did not exonerate him either.

When asked about the report by Fox News, Collins at the time called Slaughter “a despicable human being,” a rare moment of course language used by a U.S. congressman to describe a colleague. Collins disputed the findings and said he has “always followed ethics.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said on Wednesday that he was removing Collins from the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Ryan called insider trading ""a clear violation of the public trust."" He said he's moving against Collins even though a court will decide whether the lawmaker is guilty of the allegations.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement that ""the charges against Congressman Collins show the rampant culture of corruption and self-enrichment among Republicans in Washington.""

“The American people deserve better than the GOP’s corruption, cronyism, and incompetence,"" she added.

Collins has a track record of publicly backing Trump, including being one of the first sitting members of Congress to endorse his candidacy. Most recently, Collins called for an end to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into campaign collusion and blamed the Obama administration for failing to push back on Russia.

""I share President Trump's continued frustration as the left continues to try to nullify the 2016 Presidential election with claims of Russian interference,"" he said.

Collins ran unopposed in the Republican primary and holds what's largely considered a safe Republican seat in a state that went to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. He's being challenged by Democrat Nate McMurray, a Grand Island, New York, town supervisor.

"Flights were halted and a man was arrested Monday after speeding onto an airport runway in Lyon, France, officials said.

The man drove the wrong way down a highway and crashed into a barrier at the small airport, officials said. The car then rammed through two glass doors at Saint Expuery’s Terminal 1 to drive onto the tarmac.

Video footage captured by a witness showed the driver barreling through the airport before his vehicle went off road, kicking up dirt and debris.

As police closed in, the man then jumped out of the car and ran away on foot. Multiple officers and emergency response vehicles pursued him until he was caught.

Local government press officer Christelle Monteagudo told the Associated Press that officials have not yet determined the motive for the incident and are ruling nothing out at this point.

There were no reports of injuries, according to The Local.

"Liberal Florida gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum on Wednesday slammed his opponent Ron DeSantis after the Republican warned voters earlier in the day not to “monkey this up” by voting for Gillum in November.

During an appearance on Fox News, anchor Shepard Smith asked Gillum, who is black, if he considered DeSantis’ comment racist or a figment of speech.

Earlier Wednesday, the chairman of the Florida Democratic Party accused DeSantis of “racist dog whistles.”

“Well, in the handbook of Donald Trump, they no longer do whistle calls,” Gillum said. “They are now using full bullhorns.”

Gillum, a Bernie Sanders-backed progressive who won Florida’s Democratic gubernatorial primary in an upset on Tuesday, accused DeSantis of “taking a page directly from the campaign manual of Donald Trump” and said he believes Florida voters are “sick” of the division from DeSantis.

GILLUM HAUNTED BY CITY'S CORRUPTION PROBE

DeSantis, who won the Republican nomination for governor on Tuesday, made the remark during an appearance Wednesday on Fox News.

DeSantis said “we’ve got to work hard to make sure that we continue Florida going in a good direction,” adding “the last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state.”

But DeSantis’ office dismissed claims that his remarks had a racial dimension as “absurd.”

“Ron DeSantis was obviously talking about Florida not making the wrong decision to embrace the socialist policies that Andrew Gillum espouses,” spokesman Stephen Lawson said in a statement. “To characterize it as anything else is absurd.”

During his Fox News interview, Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, addressed the ongoing FBI investigation into possible corruption in the city he has led since 2014, denying any wrongdoing.

“I don’t expect any trouble my way….I welcome their investigation to get to the bottom of any corruption that might exist,” Gillum said.

According to local news outlets – which have extensively covered the case – the FBI has been investigating potential corruption related to land deals in the city. Last year, the FBI issued subpoenas for documents from the city of Tallahassee related to developers.

Gillum in 2016 also interacted with an undercover FBI agent who was posing as a businessman interested in investing in Tallahassee, according to those reports. He was introduced to that agent by lobbyist Adam Corey, a longtime friend who has since been subpoenaed as part the probe.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, Gillum scheduled a meeting with the undercover FBI agent while on a Costa Rica vacation with Corey in 2016.

Republicans, in the aftermath of Gillum’s primary win, are doing everything they can to draw attention to Gillum’s link to the probe and make sure it casts a shadow over his campaign.

“With Andrew Gillum, Florida Democrats have selected a radical far-left politician who remains at the center of an FBI anti-corruption investigation,” the Republican Governors Association said Tuesday.

"Two prominent conservative activists were accosted Monday outside a Philadelphia restaurant by a group of profanity-hurling protesters allegedly aligned with Antifa.

Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and communications director Candace Owens were attempting to eat breakfast at the Green Eggs Café near Center City, when the group gathered outside and aggressively harassed them.

In video footage posted on Owens’ Twitter page, the protesters can be seen shouting and blowing whistles in the conservative commentators’ faces while chanting “F--- white supremacy."" Owens is black.

The video also shows one of the protesters dumping a bottle of water on Kirk.

In another video posted on Owens’ Twitter account, Philadelphia police officers can be seen trying to separate the two conservatives from the protesters as Owens yells back at the crowd, ""We love the police, we love America, we love the USA.""

Kirk and Owens, who were in Philadelphia to meet with Turning Point USA board members and hold business meetings, quickly took to Twitter to denounce the protesters -- and liberals for not criticizing the Antifa ""mob.""

“If a angry conservative mob formed while two young liberals, one white guy and a black woman, were eating breakfast, and the mob hurled horrific insults, threw objects and assaulted them, the left would call it a ‘hate crime’ and every major outlet would be demanding condemnation,” Kirk tweeted.

Owens, who called Antifa “an all-white fascist organization” in an earlier tweet, thanked the police for their help.

“Would like to personally and publicly thank the @PhillyPolice force for keeping us safe today. As you can see in the video, they were all Hispanic and black,” she tweeted.

The protests in Philadelphia are the latest in a series of public attacks on conservative officials and commentators in recent months as the divide over President Trump’s policies continues to widen.

In June, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was told to leave a Virginia restaurant following a tumultuous week where the administration was forced to walk back a policy separating immigrant families caught illegally crossing the border.

Also earlier this summer, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had to cut short a working dinner at a Mexican restaurant in Washington after protesters shouted, ""Shame!"" Protesters later gathered outside Nielsen’s Virginia townhouse, chanting “no justice, no sleep” and playing recordings of immigrant children crying.

Florida Attorney General – and ardent Trump supporter – Pam Bondi was also recently confronted by a group of protesters outside the screening of a documentary about Mister Rogers in Tampa.

Conservatives have pinned the blame for such confrontations in part on Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, who urged supporters to swarm Cabinet members at gas stations and anywhere else they're seen.

“Why won’t Democrat leaders denounce these ANTIFA thugs?” Kirk tweeted on Monday. “This is the new base of the Democrat party. They hate America and will go to violent measures to attack conservatives. This is {Maxine Water’s] America - she called for these sort of attacks.”",politics
"A solid blue state that went big for Hillary Clinton in 2016 might normally seem safe territory for Democrats in a midterm cycle some pundits predict will bring a “blue wave.” The party’s problem in Connecticut is that Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy is what one poll rates the least popular governor in the nation.

His deep unpopularity now threatens to hurt the party’s chances in a gubernatorial race that normally would be a shoo-in.

A Tremont Public Advisers poll released Monday found Connecticut residents preferred a Republican for governor in November by 49 percent to 43 percent. The Republican Governors Association is targeting the state with $1.7 million in TV ads.

It seems the gubernatorial race in Connecticut may come down to a simple question: Whether voters dislike Democratic Gov. Malloy or Republican President Trump more. Neither is on the ballot this fall, but both will play a big factor. And right now, Malloy may be winning the unpopularity contest.

A union-sponsored poll conducted by the Democratic-leaning Global Strategies Group in February showed two-term Malloy less popular than the president in the liberal state, with a 24 percent approval rating compared to Trump’s 36 percent.

So will Malloy be a drag on the party?

Chris Kukk, a political science professor at Western Connecticut State University, suggested unaffiliated voters will be the ones to watch. “Unaffiliated voters outnumber Republican and Democratic voters in Connecticut, and those are the voters that swing elections in a year when Trump is very unpopular and Malloy is very unpopular,” Kukk told Fox News.

Connecticut is one of 16 races this year for an open governor’s seat, according to Ballotpedia. Both the Cook Political Report and Sabato’s Crystal Ball consider the Connecticut governor’s race a tossup. Inside Elections is scoring the contest as leaning Democrat.

The packed field for both parties will likely be thinner after May conventions, where candidates must get 15 percent of delegates to qualify for the Aug. 14 primary ballot. The most recent poll found New Britain GOP Mayor Erin Stewart and Greenwich Democratic businessman Ned Lamont emerging as their party’s frontrunners.

Stewart’s chief rivals in the field of 12 GOP contenders are Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton and former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker. The Republican convention is Friday and Saturday.

Democrats hold their state convention May 18 and 19. Of the nine Democrats, former three-term Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz and Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim are the only other candidates expected to gain enough delegates to advance to the primary. Lamont would win a majority in a two-way primary, but a three-way race would be more unpredictable, said Scott McLean, chairman of the political science department at Quinnipiac University.

The Tremont poll found Stewart beating both Democrats, Lamont beating Boughton and Bysiewicz losing to both Republicans.

Boughton, first elected Danbury mayor in 2001, gained prominence for tackling the issue of illegal immigration in his city. In 2010, Boughton lost narrowly in a race for lieutenant governor on a Republican ticket with Tom Foley to the Democratic ticket led by Malloy.

“Boughton is the best GOP candidate for winning statewide,” McLean told Fox News. “He is a center-right candidate in a state where Republicans want to see someone efficiently manage state government and keep taxes low.”

Stewart was elected to lead New Britain in 2013 at age 26 and in 2016 was ranked number one on the Newsmax list of “30 most influential Republicans under 30.”

“A young mayor out of New Britain would give a new face to the Republican Party and take away the negatives of Trump,” Kukk said.

Walker ran the Government Accountability Office, the federal government’s watchdog, from 1998 through 2008. He then led the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonprofit fiscal watchdog group.

Lamont is best known as the progressive challenger that beat moderate Sen. Joe Lieberman in a 2006 Democratic primary before losing the Senate race in November when Lieberman ran as an independent. Lamont lost to Malloy in the 2010 gubernatorial primary.

Bysiewicz, who wrote a biography of the state’s first woman governor, Ella Grasso, is running to be the state’s third female chief executive. After serving as secretary of the state, she lost a Senate primary to then-U.S. Rep. Chris Murphy in 2012.

Ganim has a checkered past. He resigned as mayor in 2003 after being convicted on public corruption charges, was sentenced to seven years in federal prison and after his release mounted a huge comeback to get re-elected mayor of Bridgeport in 2015.

While Malloy isn't term limited, he likely would have divided the Democratic Party if he sought a third term, McLean said.

The strong dislike state voters have for him is based in part on his broken promises not to hike taxes – in turn, fueling the exodus of corporations like GE and Aetna. Beyond policy, McLean said, Malloy comes across as pushy and arrogant with problems connecting to voters and bad relations with legislators.

But Christina Polizzi, spokeswoman for the Connecticut Democratic Party, argued that the party has momentum on their side after flipping 22 Connecticut municipal governments in 2017 and winning a special election in February for a state House district seat that had been Republican for 40 years.

""The bottom line is, voters in Connecticut are looking for someone who will stand up to the Trump agenda and fight for Connecticut families,"" Polizzi told Fox News. ""Republican candidates for governor have proven time and time again that they are unwilling to do that.""

None of the Republican candidates have ties to the Trump administration, while neither of the top two Democratic candidates served in public office while Malloy was governor, McLean noted.

“Malloy is on the way out and I doubt we’ll be hearing much about him for the next five months,” McLean said. “But we will be hearing a lot about Trump. So, I would predict an anti-Trump sentiment is more likely.”

Malloy was the first Democrat elected governor since 1986. The GOP made big gains in the state legislature during the Obama administration, going from 37 seats in 2008 in the House of Representatives to now holding 72 seats, compared with the Democrats' 79-seat majority. The state Senate is tied.

One reason so many candidates are in the race is Connecticut’s “Citizen’s Election Program” that provides taxpayer money for candidates—instituted after Republican Gov. John G. Rowland was convicted on corruption charges. Primary candidates are eligible for $1.25 million each if they can raise $250,000 in small donations. General election nominees get $6 million from the state.

"President Trump on Monday floated the idea of pulling the security clearance of former FBI official Phil Mudd after he went on a rant on CNN over the weekend in response to the White House decision to scrap the security clearance of former CIA chief John Brennan.

Trump tweeted that he saw the clip of Mudd becoming “totally unglued and weird” during a heated discussion with CNN analyst Paris Dennard and suggested pulling Mudd’s security clearance.

“Just watched former Intelligence Official Phillip Mudd become totally unglued and weird while debating wonderful @PARISDENNARD over Brennan’s Security Clearance,” Trump wrote in a tweet. “Dennard destroyed him but Mudd is in no mental condition to have such a Clearance. Should be REVOKED?”

During the debate, Mudd began shouting after Dennard expressed support for Trump’s decision to strip Brennan of his security clearance, saying former intelligence officials use the access to for profit in the private sector.

“A lot of these people that have these security clearances, and this is the secret in the swampy Washington, D.C., they have them and they keep them because it's profitable for them after they leave government, because if you [have] a security clearance, especially high level security clearance, your contracts and consulting gig pay you a lot more money because of the access that you have,” Dennard said, infuriating Mudd.

“I hope the president continues to do this, and I hope he adds Omarosa to the list, because if she has a clearance, she too because of her actions should have it revoked,” he added.

Mudd fired back at the suggestion former officials profit from holding a security clearance. “Profitable, Paris?” Mudd asked. “When I am required to sit on an advisory board, let me ask you one question, how much do you think I'm paid to do that at the request of the U.S. government? Give me one answer, and you've got 10 seconds? How much?”

The former FBI official then became visibly enraged, shouting “answer the question” at Dennard and insisting that he has “zero consulting relationships with the U.S. government” while Dennard continued to explain that he means private sector work.

“We’re done, Jim,"" he then said. “Get out. Twenty five years in the service and this is the s--- I get? Get out,” Mudd snapped at the end of the segment.

Mudd, who is among the dozens of former intelligence officials that criticized Trump over his decision to revoke clearance for the former CIA director, earned praise from Michael Hayden, a former CIA director whose clearance the president said he's reviewing, calling Mudd a “hero” and a “counter terrorism giant.”",politics
"President Trump on Wednesday slammed his former longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen for striking a plea deal with federal prosecutors admitting to campaign finance violations and implicating the president.

“If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen!” Trump tweeted Wednesday.

At the same time, the president tweeted in support of ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was found guilty on eight tax and bank fraud counts just as the Cohen plea deal was being finalized. Amid speculation of a possible pardon for Manafort, Trump praised him for not striking a deal with prosecutors -- and accused Cohen of making up stories to get one.

""I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. 'Justice' took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to 'break' - make up stories in order to get a 'deal.' Such respect for a brave man!"" Trump tweeted.

Cohen, once seen as one of Trump’s most loyal advisers, admitted Tuesday to violating federal campaign finance laws by arranging hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal “at the direction” of then-candidate Trump during the 2016 race.

In entering the plea, Cohen did not specifically name the two women or even Trump, recounting instead that he worked with an “unnamed candidate.” But the amounts and the dates all lined up with the payments made to Daniels and McDougal.

MICHAEL COHEN ADMITS VIOLATING CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS IN PLEA DEAL

In total, Cohen pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion, one count of making false statements to a financial institution, one count of willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count of making an excessive campaign contribution.

Cohen could have received up to 65 years in prison if convicted of all charges. However, as part of his plea deal, Cohen agreed not to challenge any sentence between 46 and 63 months. The deal does not involve a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors.

Cohen is set to be sentenced Dec. 12.

Trump’s lawyers are insisting the president did nothing wrong.

“There is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president in the government’s charges against Mr. Cohen,” Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said. “It is clear that, as the prosecutor noted, Mr. Cohen’s actions reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time.”

But Cohen’s attorney, Lanny Davis, suggested they are coming after Trump.

""Today he stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election,” Davis said Tuesday. “If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn’t they be a crime for Donald Trump?""

"Former President George H.W. Bush was taken to the hospital in Maine on Sunday after he experienced low blood pressure and fatigue, his spokesman said.

Bush, 93, who is in Maine to spend the summer at his Kennebunkport house, was taken to Southern Maine Health Care and will remain there for a few days for observation, spokesman Jim McGrath said.

“The former president is awake and alert, and not in any discomfort,” McGrath tweeted.

The 41st president was hospitalized in late April — a day after the funeral for his wife, former first lady Barbara Bush — and treated for an infection that spread to his blood. He was released earlier this month and was “happy to return home,” McGrath said.

"The Trump-Russia sleuthers have been back in the news, again giving Americans cause to doubt their claims of nonpartisanship. Last week it was Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Peter Strzok testifying to Congress that he harbored no bias against a president he still describes as “horrible” and “disgusting.” This week it was former FBI Director Jim Comey tweet-lecturing Americans on their duty to vote Democratic in November.

But the man who deserves a belated bit of scrutiny is former Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan. He’s accused President Trump of “venality, moral turpitude and political corruption,” and berated GOP investigations of the FBI. This week he claimed on Twitter that Mr. Trump’s press conference in Helsinki was “nothing short of treasonous.” This is rough stuff, even for an Obama partisan.

The CIA director couldn’t himself go public with his Clinton spin—he lacked the support of the intelligence community and had to be careful not to be seen interfering in U.S. politics. So what to do? He called Harry Reid.

That’s what Mr. Brennan is—a partisan—and it is why his role in the 2016 scandal is in some ways more concerning than the FBI’s. Mr. Comey stands accused of flouting the rules, breaking the chain of command, abusing investigatory powers. Yet it seems far likelier that the FBI’s Trump investigation was a function of arrogance and overconfidence than some partisan plot. No such case can be made for Mr. Brennan. Before his nomination as CIA director, he served as a close Obama adviser. And the record shows he went on to use his position—as head of the most powerful spy agency in the world—to assist Hillary Clinton’s campaign (and keep his job).

Mr. Brennan has taken credit for launching the Trump investigation. At a House Intelligence Committee hearing in May 2017, he explained that he became “aware of intelligence and information about contacts between Russian officials and U.S. persons.” The CIA can’t investigate U.S. citizens, but he made sure that “every information and bit of intelligence” was “shared with the bureau,” meaning the FBI. This information, he said, “served as the basis for the FBI investigation.” My sources suggest Mr. Brennan was overstating his initial role, but either way, by his own testimony, he as an Obama-Clinton partisan was pushing information to the FBI and pressuring it to act.

"A visibly shaken Sen. Lindsey Graham reminisced about the late Sen. John McCain in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Monday night. The South Carolina Republican acknowledged he's shed many tears over McCain's death, but vowed to give his longtime friend and colleague ""the send-off he deserves"" when he takes the Senate floor on Tuesday.

""I have cried a lot, and I am going to try to get over it,"" Graham told Hannity. ""Now I'm going to speak tomorrow in the Senate. [McCain's] desk was right by mine and I hope I don't crack up.""

McCain, one of Graham's ""dearest friends and mentor,"" died at age 81 on Saturday, and will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol on Friday. A memorial service will be held at the National Cathedral in Washington the following day — before McCain is laid to rest at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland, on Sunday.

JOHN MCCAIN'S MILITARY CAREER, FROM HIS TIME AS A VIETNAM WAR POW TO ROLE IN PASSING DEFENSE BILL

Graham, agreeing with Hannity that McCain was a ""hero,"" reiterated how patriotic the late senator was, and how much he adored his country.

""If I had to pick one person in the entire country to explain American to a foreigner, it'd be John,"" Graham said. ""I mean, he had a romantic view of the nation; it never died. He loved America ... [he was] willing to die for it.""

As Hannity mentioned, after his passing, several people — who weren't necessarily fond of McCain — changed their tune about the senator, later praising him for his dedication to America.

""I am better off for having known him."" - Lindsey Graham

Graham said McCain would appreciate the kind words, joking with Hannity: ""You know what John would say? 'I'll take it where I can get it.'""

""The fact that people say good things about [McCain] now, I appreciate, but the family appreciates it,"" Graham said, adding that McCain is survived by his wife, Cindy, seven children and mulitple grandchildren.

FAREWELL STATEMENT FROM JOHN MCCAIN

Graham emphasized the huge part McCain played in his life.

""I am better off for having known him,"" he said. ""He loved his country, and we will be talking a lot about what he did and how there’s a little John Mccain in all of us. If we can bring that out, the country would be in a good spot.""

After McCain died on Saturday, Graham tweeted, ""American and Freedom have lost one of her greatest champions,"" saying he'd need time to process his friend's death.

McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer in July 2017. Doctors discovered a tumor during a medical procedure to remove a blood clot from above his left eye. He remained upbeat after the diagnosis, flying back to Washington days after surgery with a large scar visible above his eye to partake in the Senate’s health care debate.",politics
"Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., on Friday reportedly joked about the Russia investigation at a high-dollar retreat on Martha’s Vineyard and told Democratic donors to “buckle up.”

Warner reportedly joked to donors that he might reveal sensitive information known only to him and Special Counsel Robert Mueller who’s investigating the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia.

“If you get me one more glass of wine, I’ll tell you stuff only Bob Mueller and I know. If you think you’ve seen wild stuff so far, buckle up. It’s going to be a wild couple of months."" - Virginia Sen. Mark Warner

“If you get me one more glass of wine, I’ll tell you stuff only Bob Mueller and I know. If you think you’ve seen wild stuff so far, buckle up. It’s going to be a wild couple of months,” he reportedly said, which was understood as a joke.

Warner, the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was at a dinner for over 100 guests as part of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s (DSCC) annual Majority Trust retreat, Politico reported.

Warner's office did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News.

The retreat is often attended by top Democratic senators where they have an opportunity to schmooze with top donors and lobbyists of the Washington, D.C.

The retreats often have a price tag for the attendees. In 2009, the attendees had to fork out over $30,000 for the event, according to the Sunlight Foundation, a non-profit advocating for transparency which published the invitation.

The latest target of Mueller’s probe into alleged collusion with Russia was former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort who was sent to jail earlier this month after a federal judge revoked his $10 million bail amid witness tampering charges brought by the special counsel.

Manafort was sent to jail while he awaits trial. He pleaded not guilty. Mueller accused Manafort of obstructing justice in the investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates back in 2016.

"The Trump administration added to its growing list of sanctions against Russia on Tuesday as U.S. lawmakers urged tighter economic restrictions on Moscow and Britain's top diplomat accused Russia's leader of pursuing policies that are making the world more dangerous.

The Treasury Department announced two new actions against Russian targets: blacklisting two companies and two individuals suspected of trying to circumvent U.S. sanctions imposed in June in response to cyberattacks; and against two Russian shipping companies suspected of transferring petroleum products to North Korean vessels in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.

While President Donald Trump has sought closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his administration has intensified economic pressure on Moscow over what it describes as ""malign Russian activity"" in Ukraine and Syria and Russia's attempts to disrupt western democracies.

Two senior officials from the State and Treasury departments told a Senate hearing Tuesday that since January 2017, 217 Russian business people, officials, and private and state-run companies, including 14 banks and 20 energy firms, have been sanctioned. In addition, they recalled that the administration had expelled 60 Russian spies and closed Russia's consulates in San Francisco and Seattle.

Marshall Billingslea, the Treasury Department's top terrorist financing official, acknowledged that the threat from Russia was ""significant and continuing"" but told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that without the sanctions ""their behavior would be even further off the charts.""

He and the State Department's top diplomat for Europe, Wess Mitchell, said Russia is feeling the impact, costing its economy tens of billions of dollars, with companies under sanctions losing a quarter of their operating revenue and having to shed employees.

But the officials faced questions from skeptical lawmakers about the administration's policy toward Russia, particularly since Trump has sent conflicting messages about it. The committee's chairman, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., called Trump's comments ""undisciplined"" and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire lamented that the president had issued ""contradictory"" statements about Russia. ""Until we see a change in that behavior we are going to continue to see and have concern.""

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said it appeared to him as though the administration were pursuing two different policies: one of the president's and one of federal national security agencies.

Mitchell denied that. ""This is the president's administration, this is his foreign policy."" Although Trump himself has repeatedly cast doubt on Russia's culpability in 2016 election meddling, Mitchell and Billingslea both pointed to the Kremlin and Putin as the source.

""Putin wants to break apart the American republic, not by influencing an election or two, but by systematically inflaming the perceived fault-lines that exist within our society,"" Mitchell said. ""His is a strategy of chaos for strategic effect. Accepting this fact is absolutely essential for developing a long-term comprehensive response to the problem. The most dangerous thing we could do is to politicize the challenge, which in itself would be a gift to Putin.""

Russia denies accusations of election meddling, but suspicions of interference deepened Tuesday when Microsoft said it had uncovered new Russian hacking efforts targeting U.S. political groups before November's midterm elections. Russian officials dismissed the company's claims as unfounded.

Microsoft said that a group tied to the Russian government created fake websites that appeared to spoof two American conservative organizations: the Hudson Institute and the International Republican Institute. Three other fake sites were designed to look as if they belonged to the U.S. Senate.

Meanwhile Britain's foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, called on the European Union to ensure that its sanctions against Russia were comprehensive, in response to accusations Moscow poisoned a former Russian spy in Britain, using a nerve agent. He said the EU and United States should respond to Russia with ""one voice.""

""Of course we must engage with Moscow, but we must also be blunt,"" Hunt said in a speech in Washington. ""Russia's foreign policy under President Putin has made the world a more dangerous place.""

The U.S. sanctions announced Tuesday targeted two companies and people suspected of trying to circumvent existing sanctions against Divetechnoservices of St. Petersburg. That company was sanctioned in June for procuring underwater equipment and diving systems for Russian government agencies, including the Federal Security Service, formerly Russia's KGB spy service.

The U.S. alleges that Marina Igorevna Tsareva, an import manager for Divetechnoservices, attempted to help the company circumvent U.S. sanctions through Vela-Marine Limited of St. Petersburg. Treasury said another employee, Anton Aleksandrovich Nagibin, also helped Divetechnoservices circumvent U.S. sanctions.

The two companies targeted in Tuesday's action were Vela-Marine and Lacno S.R.O., which is based in Slovakia.

The sanctions freeze any assets they may have in U.S. jurisdictions and bar Americans from doing business with them.

Separately, Treasury targeted Primorye Maritime Logistics Co. and Gudzon Shipping Co., based in the city of Vladivostok, and six of their vessels. The department said that earlier this year, one vessel linked to the Russian companies transferred 3,500 tons of oil to ships flying the North Korea flag.",politics
"Saudi Arabia has arrested dozens of princes, senior military officers, businessmen and top officials, including a well-known royal billionaire with extensive holdings in Western companies, as part of a sweeping anti-corruption probe that further cements control in the hands of its young crown prince.

A high-level employee at Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's Kingdom Holding Co. told The Associated Press that the royal— who is one of the world's richest men— was among those detained overnight Saturday. The company's stock was down nearly 9 percent in trading Sunday on the Saudi stock exchange.

The surprise arrests, which also reportedly include two of the late King Abdullah's sons, were hailed by pro-government media outlets as the greatest sign yet that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is keeping his promise to reform the country, long been plagued by allegations of corruption at the highest levels of government.

Analysts have suggested the arrest of once-untouchable members of the royal family is the latest sign that the 32-year-old crown prince is moving to quash potential rivals or critics. The prince's swift rise to power has unnerved more experienced, elder members of the ruling Al Saud family, which has long ruled by consensus, though ultimate decision-making remains with the monarch.

The king named his son, the crown prince, as head of an anti-corruption committee established late Saturday, just hours before its arrest of top officials.

A Saudi government official with close ties to security says 11 princes and 38 others are being held in five-star hotels across the capital, Riyadh. The official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.

The scale of the arrests is unprecedented in Saudi Arabia, where senior royals and their business associates were seen as operating above the law. Saudi nationals have long complained of rampant corruption in government and of public funds being squandered or misused by people in power.

Shortly before the arrests, King Salman had ousted Prince Miteb bin Abdullah from his post as head of the National Guard. The prince is reportedly among those detained in the sweep, as is his brother, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, who was once governor of Riyadh. Both are sons of the late King Abdullah, who ruled before his half brother King Salman.

Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne.

Saudi Twitter accounts released several other names of those arrested, such as: Alwalid al-Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman with ties to the royal family who runs the Arabic satellite group MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, the former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; Ibrahim Assaf, the former finance minister; and Bakr Binladin, head of the Saudi Binladin Group, a major business conglomerate.

An earlier crackdown on perceived critics of the crown prince included clerics, writers, lesser-known princes and Saudi figures popular on social media.

""The dismissals and detentions suggest that Prince Mohammed rather than forging alliances is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the national guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,"" James M. Dorsey, a Gulf specialist and senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said an analysis of the shake-up.

Saudi Arabia said late Saturday it intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen at Riyadh International Airport, on the outskirts of the capital. The crown prince, as defense minister, oversees the stalemated war against Yemen's Iranian-allied rebels.

The Finance Ministry said the anti-corruption probe ""opens a new era of transparency and accountability,"" enhances confidence in the rule of law and improves the kingdom's investment climate.

Reports suggested those detained were being held in the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh, which only days earlier hosted a major investment conference.

Marriott International said in a statement that it is currently evaluating the situation at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. ""As a matter of guest privacy, we do not discuss the guests or groups with whom we do business or may be visitors of the hotel,"" the statement added.

It is not clear what Prince Alwaleed or others are being investigated for.

The Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel said the anti-corruption probe was looking into the response to flooding in Jiddah that killed around 120 people in 2009 and devastated the city again in 2011, as well as the government's handling of a Coronavirus outbreak that has killed several hundred people in recent years.

Prince Alwaleed's many investments include Twitter, Apple, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Citigroup, and the Four Seasons, Fairmont and Movenpick hotel chains. He is also an investor in ride-sharing services Lyft and Careem.

The prince, often pictured on his 85.65-meter (281 foot) superyacht in the Mediterranean, is among the most outspoken Saudi royals and a longtime advocate for women's rights. He is also majority owner of the popular Rotana Group of Arabic channels.

The AP reached out overnight to Kingdom Holding for comment. There was no response as of Sunday afternoon. The senior employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of repercussions, said security bodies informed him of the arrest.

The kingdom's top council of clerics issued a statement saying it is an Islamic duty to fight corruption— essentially giving religious backing to the high-level arrests being reported. A top royal court official, Badr al-Asaker, on Sunday appeared to confirm the arrests on Twitter, describing a ""historic and black night against the corrupt.""

The government said the anti-corruption committee has the right to issue arrest warrants, impose travel restrictions and freeze bank accounts. It can also trace funds, prevent the transfer of funds or the liquidation of assets, and take other precautionary measures until cases are referred to the judiciary.

Meanwhile, Prince Miteb was replaced by a lesser known royal, Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf al-Muqrin, to head the National Guard— a prestigious force tasked with protecting the royal family, important holy sites in Mecca and Medina, and oil and gas sites.

Just three months earlier, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was plucked from the line of succession and from his post as interior minister, overseeing internal security. This laid the groundwork for the king's son to claim the mantle of crown prince.",world
"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reportedly ordered a high ranking army officer to be executed after he was accused of giving extra food and fuel rations to troops and their families.

Daily NK reported that Hyon Ju Song, the lieutenant general of the Korean People’s Army in the country’s capital, Pyongyang, was executed by a firing squad for “charges of abusing authority and engaging in anti-Party acts.”

Hyon was reportedly a rising star in the army before his death. He served as a member of the Workers' Party of Korea's Central Committee and battalion commander under the Supreme Guard Command.

“While checking the oil supplies for the Sohae Satellite Launching Station during the comprehensive inspections of wartime supplies on April 10, Hyon stated, ‘We no longer have to suffer and tighten our belts to make rockets or nuclear weapons.’ This was seen as an abuse of authority and a treasonous statement that opposed the Party’s military-first policy,” a source told Daily NK.

GERMAN MAN SUSPECTED OF MURDERING 21 CO-WORKERS BY POISONING THEIR FOOD

The source said Hyon ordered “2,000 pounds of fuel, 1,300 pounds of rice, and 1,600 pounds of corn to military officers at the Launching Station and their families.”

“This was considered an anti-Party act violating the Ten Principles for the Establishment of the Party’s One-Ideology System,” the source said.

The officer was also accused of “failing to maintain secrecy regarding the affairs of the Party, military, and government institutions, displaying generosity by distributing unauthorized handouts, and misrepresenting the ideology of the Party,” the source said.

PRIVATE PLANE CRASHES IN CROWDED MUMBAI AREA; 5 PEOPLE DEAD

A different source told Daily NK that Kim was infuriated when he heard of the reports and ordered the officer’s execution. Hyon was placed on trial before he was brought in front of the firing squad, the source said.

“The ideological poisoning that is personal idolization is corrupting the chief personnel in the People’s Army. We must nip the bud of ideological poisoning,” the source quoted Kim as saying.",world
"My decision to be a Democrat was never a decision. It was just expected of me. It was understood. Born into a family of Democrats, my grandfather would often spend weekends talking to me about his respect for Franklin Roosevelt and his annoyance with President Reagan. I listened and absorbed, but was not yet ready to think critically about what I was told – or to decide for myself.

I love and miss my grandfather, but life has since taught me that thinking critically about the principles of the Democrat party is never encouraged because if you do, you have no choice but to leave – to walk away.

I was elected National President of the College Democrats of America in 1999, and now I’m a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in 2018. While the Democrats’ influence over my political philosophy defined a few years in my late teens and early twenties, that influence could not withstand the test of life and experience that made me a conservative as an adult. In contrast with my time as a Democrat, my evolution to becoming a conservative Republican was a fully mindful and deliberate decision, based on my life experiences that left me with no other option.

While my choice was made clear to me through the experience of my marriage, the birth of my three children, my acceptance of Jesus Christ as my savior, my time fighting in two wars, and my experience in business since leaving the Marine Corps, it came at personal cost.

My parents have since turned their back on me, my wife, their grandchildren, and their extended family. Adding to this, they decided to make the maximum contribution to my Democrat opponent in my campaign for U.S. Senate in Wisconsin, an intentional personal blow that made headlines across the country. It was deliberate – and it is a true representation of the intolerance of a political philosophy that stands on the false platform of tolerance.

I don’t enjoy talking about this highly personal experience, but as I see the #WalkAway movement gain momentum, I feel compelled to share my story. As #WalkAway grows, conservatives need to reach out to those who were raised to believe in a Democrat Party and a liberal political philosophy that does nothing to make them more successful.

Many others who have decided to leave the Democrat Party have also likely paid a personal price for their decision. And others are not yet ready to leave because of the judgment and ridicule they will undoubtedly receive from other Democrats – whether family, friends, or co-workers. Unfortunately, their fear is founded.

The Democrat party is not the party of tolerance. It is not the party of acceptance. It is the party of intolerance. It is the party of closed doors, but open borders. It is the party of judgement. It is the party of identity politics.

The Democrat party is not the party of tolerance. It is not the party of acceptance. It is the party of intolerance. It is the party of closed doors, but open borders. It is the party of judgment. It is the party of identity politics. And that is why the #WalkAway movement is resonating. Because when you stop and ask yourself why you should be a Democrat, it is impossible to answer if you acknowledge the party’s hypocrisy, since it openly advocates for policies that encourage dependency and destroy opportunity for all of us.

As we look to the future, conservatives must aggressively reach out and welcome those who were not born into conservative families. We must continue to champion the dignity of all human life, conserve and strategically invest our financial resources, and work to build a strong defense that secures our nation’s prosperity for all. This is how I will win my election against Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin this November, and also how we will win the future of this nation.

During my Senate race, I have learned that some establishment Republican circles are reluctant to accept new members to our party. Too many believe that they have a club that they control – and would like to keep it that way since it keeps them in power. Those who demand that people be Republicans from birth in order to have a voice in the conservative movement would shrink, not grow our party. And their short-sighted perspective on people’s ability to mature as they experience life would keep us from bringing new Republicans into the fold, like Donald Trump has done. We need to push beyond these voices, and welcome new conservatives in order to secure our nation’s future.

If you’ve decided to #WalkAway or plan to, I encourage you to find strength in those who have already walked the path. Find strength in the principles of conservatism that are founded in faith, liberty, and the Constitution. And find strength in those who have walked the path before you: President Ronald Reagan, President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, former U.S. Senator Phil Gramm – and so many others. Find strength in our decision to choose to believe in the human capacity to succeed when free, as you do the same.",politics
"During a speech Saturday at an immigration rally in California, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters reacted defiantly to alleged threats reportedly directed at her following her previous remarks about the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy.

Waters took the podium at the Families Belong Together rally in downtown Los Angeles, one of the many rallies staged across the country urging for the reunification of families who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border.

She told the crowd that she has “no fear” and is “in this fight” after saying some congressional lawmakers felt “intimidated.”

“And I know that there are those who are talking about censuring me, talking about kicking me out of Congress, talking about shooting me, talking about hanging me,” she told the disapproving crowd. “All I have to say is this: If you shoot me, you better shoot straight. There's nothing like a wounded animal.”

“And I know that there are those who are talking about censuring me, talking about kicking me out of Congress, talking about shooting me, talking about hanging me. All I have to say is this: If you shoot me, you better shoot straight. There's nothing like a wounded animal.” - U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.

THOUSANDS RALLY NATIONWIDE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT FAMILIES SEPARATED AT BORDER

Waters went on to say that she was willing “to make whatever sacrifices” were necessary, adding: “I am not about to let this country go by the way of Donald Trump.”

“We are sick and tired of him. He's been there too long,” she said. “They dare me to say 'Impeach him.' Today I say, 'Impeach 45.'”

“I am not about to let this country go by the way of Donald Trump. ... We are sick and tired of him. He's been there too long. They dare me to say 'Impeach him.' Today I say, 'Impeach 45.'” - U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.

Her remarks came after she encouraged her supporters earlier this month to fight back against the White House amid a controversial immigration policy that ultimately led to the separation of migrant children from their parents after crossing the border.

Those earlier remarks prompted a reaction from President Donald Trump, in a Twitter message Wednesday:

""Congratulations to Maxine Waters, whose crazy rants have made her, together with Nancy Pelosi, the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party,"" the president wrote. ""Together, they will Make America Weak Again! But have no fear, America is now stronger than ever before, and I’m not going anywhere!""

Waters was also featured prominently in a campaign ad posted online by the Republican National Committee that criticized the political left as being ""unhinged.""

Speaking previously on MSNBC, Waters said that current administration officials who defend Trump “know what they’re doing is wrong,” and said they soon won’t be able to peacefully appear in public without being harassed.

“They’re not going to be able to go to a restaurant, they’re not going to be able to stop at a gas station, they’re not going to be able to shop at a department store,” she went on to say. “The people are going to turn on them, they’re going to protest, they’re going to absolutely harass them.”

MAXINE WATERS PUSHES SUPPORTERS TO FIGHT TRUMP WH, SAYS ‘THE PEOPLE’ WILL ‘ABSOLUTELY HARASS’ TRUMP STAFFERS

She made similar comments at a Los Angeles rally, telling supporters that she wanted “history to record that we stood up that we pushed back that we fought that we did not consider ourselves victims of this president.”

Following the remarks, Waters had to call off scheduled appearances in Texas and Alabama after various threats were allegedly made at her, according to the Los Angeles Times. Waters reportedly told radio station KPFK-FM on Saturday that organizers of the events “didn’t have all of our security in order and organized for those two trips, but we’ve got it together now.”

“We're going on with our schedule, and we're going to keep talking about this president and his policies, and we're going to keep fighting for these children and their parents and these families,” she told the station, the Times reported.

"President Trump on Friday told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to cancel his planned trip to North Korea, citing a lack of “sufficient progress” with the rogue regime on denuclearization, while also slamming China.

“I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea, at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” Trump tweeted. “Additionally, because of our much stronger trading stance with China, I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were (despite the UN Sanctions which are in place).”

He added moments later: “Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future, most likely after our Trading relationship with China is resolved. In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards to Chairman Kim. I look forward to seeing him soon!”

The president’s directive came after Pompeo’s announcement Thursday that he would travel to the country next week.

A state department spokesperson told Fox News that both Pompeo and Special Envoy Beigun’s travel to North Korea has been postponed, and that the decision was made by the President in consultation with his national security team.

Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un engaged in a historic summit in June in Singapore, where the dictator promised to work toward “complete denuclearization.” Despite that agreement, the rogue regime is possibly constructing new intercontinental ballistic missiles.

A U.S. official with knowledge of the intelligence assessment told Fox News late last month that Kim’s regime is pushing forward with building ICBMs.

Also last month, The Washington Post reported that satellite images appeared to indicate North Korea’s possible construction of ICBMs at the same facility the country produced its first long-range missiles, including the Hwasong-15, which may have the capability of hitting the U.S. East Coast.

North Korea launched its first successful ICBM on July 4, 2017.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out Friday at the European Union over its first financial support package to help bolster Iran's flagging economy, calling it ""a big mistake"" and ""like a poison pill to the Iranian people.""

Speaking on a trip to Lithuania, Netanyahu criticized the EU, which announced Thursday a first tranche of 18 million euros ($21 million), part of the bloc's commitment to keeping the Iran nuclear deal alive.

In May, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from that deal, and began restoring U.S. sanctions. The move has been exacerbating a financial crisis in Iran that has sent its currency tumbling.

""I think that the decision yesterday by the EU to give 18 million euros to Iran is a big mistake. It's like a poison pill to the Iranian people and to the efforts to curb Iranian aggression in the region and beyond the region,"" Netanyahu said.

""Iran attempted to conduct a terror attack on European soil just weeks ago... That is incredible,"" he told a press conference that followed a meeting with three Baltic prime ministers — Lithuanian Saulius Skvernelis, Estonia's Juri Ratas and Maris Kucinskis of Latvia.

Netanyahu was apparently referring to a suspected bomb plot against an Iranian opposition rally in France in late June that was thwarted by authorities. An Iranian diplomat is suspected of involvement.

Earlier, Netanyahu met with Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite who reiterated the EU position that Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory violate international law.

A day earlier, Netanyahu said that Israel was ""often mistreated by the EU,"" adding there were ""many distortions."" Netanyahu, however, welcomed the decision by major international airlines to end their direct flights to Iran's capital, Tehran, in September, after Trump's sanctions move.

Skvernelis said in an interview with the Baltic News Service that after a meeting Thursday with Netanyahu, ""I believe Lithuania really has a better understanding of Israel and that understanding could be spread among other EU countries. ""

""We need to better listen, hear them out and understand their position. We definitely lack a direct dialogue,"" he said.

""But we have to admit that today Israel is not only waging war and defending its independence, the lives of its people, but is also fighting in a wider context, if we speak about terrorism and potential expansion of IS fighters to Europe,"" Skvernelis said.

Netanyahu arrived Thursday in Vilnius on a four-day visit, the first to Lithuania by an Israeli prime minister.

"Despite his rhetoric that immigration hurts American workers, President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club is seeking to hire 61 foreign workers for the 2018 winter season, according to the Labor Department.

Trump’s “Winter White House” has applied to hire 21 cooks from other countries to work at the resort from October to May. The Palm Beach, Fla., club also wants to hire 40 foreigners for wait-staff positions.

The seasonal workers would be required to return to their home country once their H-2B visas expire.

Critics of the visa program claim it is a tool employers can use to exploit vulnerable foreign workers and represses wages for American workers by providing a cheap labor source for companies. Supporters say the program is necessary to keep American businesses afloat and allows seasonal businesses to operate at a greater capacity.

In order to obtain H-2B visas, employers are required to prove there aren’t enough U.S. workers who are “able, willing, qualified and available” to do the work. By law, every open position must be advertised in the community.

In May, the Department of Homeland Security said it would allow an additional 15,000 H-2B visas in 2018. Congress set a cap of 66,000 new H-2B visas a year.

WARM MILK AND MISSING CONCRETE: MAR-A-LAGO CITED FOR FOOD VIOLATIONS, SAFETY ISSUES

This year, the pay for a cook at Mar-a-Lago starts at $13.31 per hour – down three cents from the year before. But the base salary for servers rose to $12.68 per hour this year from $11.88 per hour the year before.

Other Trump-related businesses have also gone outside the U.S. to pad its seasonal work force. Trump’s golf club in Westchester County, N.Y., asked to hire 14 foreign staff for cook and server spots. The Trump Winery in Charlottesville, Va., is looking for 23 H-2B visas.

"Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, the self-styled ""maverick"" of the Senate who has served three decades in Congress, will discontinue medical treatment for brain cancer, his family said in a statement Friday.

The Vietnam War veteran, who survived five years as a prisoner of war and went on to become his party's presidential nominee in 2008, was diagnosed last July with a brain tumor following a procedure earlier in the year to remove a blood clot from above his left eye.

He has not voted since last December. In Friday's statement, his family revealed how the disease has worsened:

“Last summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: he had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict.""

They said, ""With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.""

Reaction poured in after the family's announcement.

""The entire McCain clan is doing exactly what the McCains have done through generations — rise to the meet the challenge,"" said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close McCain friend.

""John McCain is an American hero, always putting country before self. From Vietnam to the halls of the U.S. Senate, the spirit of service and civility that has guided Senator McCain's life stands as a model for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation,"" Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said in a statement.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., tweeted: ""Very sad to hear this morning’s update from the family of our dear friend @SenJohnMcCain. We are so fortunate to call him our friend and colleague. John, Cindy, and the entire McCain family are in our prayers at this incredibly difficult hour.""

The Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix last summer said that the original blood clot was associated with a primary brain tumor, known as a glioblastoma.

McCain, 81, has served in the U.S. Senate for more than two decades and ran for president twice. He lost the GOP nomination to George W. Bush in 2000 and was the Republican nominee in 2008 before losing to Barack Obama in the general election.

McCain was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for more than five years. Injuries from being tortured left him unable to lift his arms above his head.

Last December, McCain returned to the Senate for the first time since his brain cancer diagnosis. He delivered powerful remarks on the Senate floor addressing the need for bipartisanship amid gridlock in the chamber.

“Make no mistake, my service here is the most important job I have had in my life. And I am so grateful to the people of Arizona for the privilege—for the honor—of serving here and the opportunities it gives me to play a small role in the history of the country I love,” McCain said, acknowledging senators he’s “known and admired.” “But they knew that however sharp and heartfelt their disputes, however keen their ambitions, they had an obligation to work collaboratively to ensure the Senate discharged its constitutional responsibilities effectively.”

McCain has criticized the Senate’s deliberations in the last year, calling them “more partisan, more tribal” than any time he remembered.

McCain blamed “both sides” for the lack of cooperation.

Earlier this year, McCain penned a memoir titled “The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other Appreciations,” written by himself, and Mark Salter, who had collaborated with McCain on all seven of his other books.

""I don't know how much longer I'll be here. Maybe I'll have another five years. Maybe, with the advances in oncology, they'll find new treatments for my cancer that will extend my life. Maybe I'll be gone before you read this. My predicament is, well, rather unpredictable,"" he wrote. ""But I'm prepared for either contingency, or at least I'm getting prepared. I have some things I'd like to take care of first, some work that needs finishing, and some people I need to see. And I want to talk to my fellow Americans a little more if I may.""

McCain, who has repeatedly been at odds with President Trump and criticized his rhetoric and leadership, said this year that he doesn’t want the president to attend his funeral, and prefers that Vice President Pence be there instead.

Last week, Trump signed a $716 billion defense policy bill, titled “John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019,” though did not mention the senator.

"The lawyer for President Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen said he was blaming himself, not CNN, after the network ran a story about Cohen knowing the president had advance knowledge of that Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer offering dirt on Hillary Clinton.

In an interview with Howard Kurtz on Fox News’ “MediaBuzz,” attorney Lanny Davis said he thought he was asking CNN to investigate a hunch he had that Trump knew about the meeting with the Russian lawyer, but that he did not make his uncertainty “clear enough.”

“I can understand that they interpreted what I said as a confirmation, and have not blamed CNN,” Davis said. “I have blamed myself for not being more clear that, in my mind, I did not know the details about that meeting, and I should not have encouraged any reporter.”

Davis added: “I do think, for everybody who deals with the media in my position, this is a lesson, maybe a teaching moment. Don't even float stories on background, which is our expression for anonymously, unless you have a certainty of the facts, and you're asking reporters to go look to confirm those facts.”

Despite Davis backing off the story, CNN is sticking by its reporting with reporter Jim Sciutto and Watergate legend Carl Bernstein saying they had more than one source for the story.

CNN's story, written in late July, said Cohen was willing to say that he heard Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., tell his father about the Russians' offer to share material about Clinton, his Democratic rival for the presidency. It also said that Trump gave the go-ahead to take the meeting at Trump Tower. If true, that would contradict what Trump and representatives have long said, that he didn't know about the meeting until long after it happened.

The network's original story cited “sources with knowledge” telling the network about Cohen's claim. The network noted in a follow-up story last Tuesday that Davis had admitted to being one of the sources for its original report. CNN technically didn't confirm that in the Tuesday story — networks hate to be in a position of revealing confidential sources, as analysts have noted — but the Tuesday report did indicate that Davis said he was a source.

One big apparent problem for CNN: The July story said, “contacted by CNN, one of Cohen's attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment.”

The controversy over the story has given Trump more ammunition in his battle against so-called “fake news,” in which CNN is a frequent target. “CNN is being torn apart from within based on their being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit the mistake.”

He also launched a personal attack against Bernstein, accusing him of “making up story after story.”

CNN responded with a tweet saying it “stands by our reporting and our reporters.”

Bernstein also tweeted, saying: “I have spent my life as a journalist bringing the truth to light, through administrations of both parties. No taunt will diminish my commitment to that mission.”

Despite CNN standing by the reporting, in his interview on “MediaBuzz” Davis downplayed CNN’s role and tried to put the blame squarely on his lack of clarity when speaking to the network.

“I disclosed myself as a source, seeking reporters to confirm something that I wasn't sure about and I was very unclear in that,” he said. “I thought it was important not to blame CNN, not to blame anyone other than myself.”

"Sunday marks the 73rd anniversary of V-J Day – Victory over Japan, when World War II ended on Sept. 2, 1945 with Japan’s surrender to the United States in a ceremony about the battleship USS Missouri. It followed V-E Day – Victory in Europe – on May 8 that same year, when the Allies accepted the surrender of Nazi Germany.

If you’ve ever watched the classic film “It’s a Wonderful Life,” you may recognize these lines from the scene where an angel recounts George Bailey’s actions at the end of World War II: “Like everybody else, on V-E Day, he wept and prayed. On V-J Day, he wept and prayed again.”

When the movie was first released in 1946, audiences got the reference right away. They had just lived through that long and bloody clash of arms. They knew full well why people wept and prayed on the day when the war in Europe ended, and again when our hostilities with Japan came to a close.

But 73 years later, it’s a different story. At a time when many aren’t even sure what “V-E” and “V-J” stand for, their significance seems to have faded from memory.

Perhaps that’s because the images of a war’s end aren’t as stark as those that mark its beginning. Americans, after all, were jolted into the conflict by the horrific events and footage of Dec. 7, 1941, as Japanese fighter planes attacked U.S. ships docked at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.

The scene on Sept. 2, 1945 was much quieter. And yet what was being communicated – that the United States would be magnanimous in victory and not pursue a vindictive peace – spoke volumes.

Such a stance is a proud fixture of American history.

Britain, the nation America fought in two bloody wars to win and then secure our independence, soon became our closest ally. Such healing also followed our nation’s Civil War, led by the stirring words President Lincoln delivered in his second Inaugural address.

Lincoln said: “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.”

When the guns fell silent in 1945 it was the same story. U.S. Army Gen. Douglas MacArthur told those assembled on the deck of the battleship Missouri 73 years ago that they were not meeting “in a spirit of distrust, malice or hatred.” It was instead their duty to rise to a “higher dignity.”

“It is my earnest hope, and indeed the hope of all mankind,” MacArthur said, “that from this solemn occasion a better world shall emerge out of the blood and carnage of the past – a world founded upon faith and understanding, a world dedicated to the dignity of man and the fulfillment of his most cherished wish for freedom, tolerance and justice.”

It worked. Appealing to what President Lincoln once called “the better angels of our nature” led to a true and lasting peace. We didn’t put Japan under our thumb, creating rancor and vengeful feelings. We helped Japan rebuild and rejoin the nations of the world, not as a beaten foe but as a peaceful partner.

The result? More than seven decades later, Japan is one of our staunchest allies – one that helps preserve, rather than imperil, peace in the Pacific.

I see that as the true hallmark of American might. We use our power not for subjugation and conquest, but to stop aggression and right injustice. And once the battles have ceased, we work to lift up others and make the world a better, safer place.

The late Sen. John McCain, a man who lived true to the Warrior’s Code, embraced this conciliatory approach. Though tortured mercilessly as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, McCain worked diligently not for revenge, but to normalize relations between the United States and his former captors.

As this true American hero explained in 2000: “The object of my relationship with Vietnam has been to heal the wounds that exist, particularly among our veterans, and to move forward with a positive relationship.”

An open-hands, open-hearts approach can work at home as well as abroad. In a time of rising incivility and escalating rhetoric, Americans would do well to follow Lincoln and MacArthur’s examples. To seek more peaceful ways to express our differences of opinion. Not to “repay evil with evil or insult with insult,” but to offer our blessings instead.

As the proud generations before us demonstrated, it’s never easy. But it very often is the right – and the smartest –thing to do.

And it’s what puts the “victory” in Victory Day.",world
"Tuesday’s primaries show there’s no doubt the Democratic Party is lurching to the left.

The last time Florida Democrats won the state’s governorship was in 1994. With GOP Gov. Rick Scott leaving office to run for U.S. Senate, Democratic Party leaders were determined to nominate a candidate who could appeal to centrists. They recruited former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, the daughter of a popular former governor and U.S. senator, who had won support from business in the past.

But in a major upset, Graham lost the gubernatorial primary to Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who had the endorsement of Bernie Sanders and top liberal donors George Soros and Tom Steyer. Gillum swept the state’s urban areas by targeting young people, single women and black voters – a coalition he hopes to ride to victory in November.

The governor’s race in the nation’s third-most populous state will probably represent the starkest ideological contrast in the country. Gillum is unapologetically liberal, calling for a $15 an hour minimum wage and repeal of the state’s “stand your ground” law, which allows residents to use force without retreating to defend themselves against threats.

Gillum’s GOP opponent will be U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, who swept the Republican primary with the endorsement of President Trump. DeSantis is also the favorite of free-market groups such as the Club for Growth. During his career in Congress he has riled some of his colleagues by opposing the use of taxpayer dollars to settle sexual misconduct claims and to give Congress special privileges under ObamaCare.

Despite DeSantis’ maverick history, you can expect the national media to shower Gillum with favorable coverage. Much like African-American gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Gillum will be heralded as a symbol of a “New South” that is progressive and focused on diversity.

Gillum’s big problem will be convincing voters he can improve on the pro-growth policies of Gov. Scott. Florida’s unemployment rate is a third of what it was in 2010. The state has the highest public high school graduation rate in 13 years, and the lowest crime rate in 45 years. DeSantis’ campaign will focus on how Gillum’s agenda could derail that progress.

In other primaries, Arizona Republicans dodged a bullet in the key U.S. Senate race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. Martha McSally, a U.S. House member who was the first female Air Force pilot to see combat, won a majority of the Republican primary vote. She beat former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former state legislator Kelli Ward, both of whom carried enough baggage to be easy targets for Democrats in the fall.

McSally will now face U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in November. The three-term Democrat has a carefully cultivated reputation as a centrist. But she showed a willingness to vote for higher taxes and liberal social positions as a state legislator.

McSally has already launched an ad comparing the whereabouts of the two candidates at the time of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, with McSally beside a fighter jet and Sinema protesting military action in a pink tutu.

The primary season for Campaign 2018 is now nearing a close. In most of the key races in the November midterm elections, voters will be given a clear choice between a candidate favorable to President Trump’s policies and someone who wants to upend them. Unlike many previous midterm elections, this November will truly represent a choice and not an echo.",politics
"As the Islamic State is driven out of its former strongholds, a U.N. panel is warning that the next big terror threat in the region could come, once again, from Al Qaeda -- led by the son of Usama bin Laden.



The report by U.N. experts, delivered to the Security Council and released this week, included startling findings about both terror networks. The report found that while ISIS had been defeated militarily in Iraq and most of Syria, it had rallied in early 2018 and still had approximately 20,000-30,000 members in the two countries.

The U.S.-led coalition in the region racked up numerous military wins against the group in 2017 and helped reduce its territory to mere pockets of Syria. At the State of the Union address this year, President Trump declared victory: “I’m proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria.”

The U.N. report found ISIS, though, is in the process of moving from “a proto-State network to a covert network” that continues to threaten other countries, and its leadership is still in tact, under Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.

Yet the report also raised significant concerns about Al Qaeda, which fell into the background amid the international attention on ISIS and its brutal tactics, particularly after the death of Usama bin Laden in 2011.



The report found that Al Qaeda is still a global network showing resilience, and it is stronger than ISIS in places like Somalia, Yemen and South Asia -- and its leadership in Iran has grown more prominent.



Further, bin Laden’s son -- Hamza bin Laden -- has “continued to emerge as a leadership figure in Al Qaeda,” the report said.



“Al Qaeda’s leadership demonstrates strategic patience and its regional affiliates exercise good tactical judgment, embedding themselves in local issues and becoming players,"" it said.



Earlier this month, The Guardian reported that the 29-year-old Hamza, who has said he wants to avenge his father, is believed to have married the daughter of Mohammed Atta -- the Egyptian national who hijacked and flew the first plane into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.

BIN LADEN'S SON MARRIED 9/11 LEAD HIJACKER'S DAUGHTER, REPORT SAYS



While the U.N. said there is little evidence as yet of a direct global threat from Al Qaeda, “improved leadership and enhanced communication will probably increase the threat over time, as will any rise in the tendency, already visible in some regions, of ISIL supporters to join Al Qaeda.”



The report comes amid growing international concern about the civil war in Yemen between the Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-backed Houthis. Al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP) has gained a foothold in the south of the wartorn country amid the chaos in the country.



This month, an Associated Press investigation found that the Saudi-led coalition has been cutting secret deals with Al Qaeda fighters, paying some to leave cities and towns, allowing others to retreat with weapons and cash. Others were recruited to join the coalition. Participants in those agreement said the U.S. was aware of the arrangements and held off on drone strikes.

U.N. Special Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths has invited both sides of the conflict to meet in Geneva for talks in September.

"When Callista and I first heard the news that Sen. John McCain had died, we were deeply saddened for his family. We are especially close to his daughter, Meghan, and had watched her devote endless hours in Arizona being with her dad as he fought the same terrible brain malignancy that had taken the life of Sen. Ted Kennedy.

McCain actually died on the ninth anniversary of Kennedy passing away. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Meghan, her mother Cindy and their entire family.

John McCain’s death is an appropriate time to think about this extraordinary man and his life.

I had been shaped in my view of McCain by my good friend, retired Air Force Gen. Chuck Boyd. Boyd had been a prisoner of war in Vietnam for nearly seven years (1966-1973) and is the only POW from the Vietnam War to achieve four-star rank. He respected John McCain from the bottom of his heart. He felt that McCain had shown courage and loyalty both to America and to his fellow POWs.

John McCain was always pushing the margins, looking for new ideas and trying to find better ways to do things.

By the time McCain won a House seat in 1982 he was already a significant figure. He had become a close friend to both President Ronald and Nancy Reagan. He had been a remarkably effective congressional liaison for the Navy, often pushing a buildup in opposition to the Carter administration for which he was supposedly working.

When John came to the House he was well known, energetic, enthusiastic and very personable. Both Democrats and Republicans liked him. He was also opinionated, argumentative and enthusiastically prepared to stand up for his beliefs.

One of my most personal encounters with John was in 1986 when I was in a very intense fight with the House Democratic leadership. Two physically large House Democrats came over and said they were sick and tired of what I was doing and I ought to know there would be a payback. One of them said “we are coming for you.”

For 81 years John McCain loved his country, lived his life as a patriot, and accepted hardships that few Americans have had to endure.

I had not realized that McCain had calmly come over to stand next to me. When the Democrat sounded threatening, John instinctively stepped closer to me and said “when you come for Newt, come for me too, the name’s McCain.”

I almost had the feeling I was seeing the kind of instinctive protectiveness McCain had developed for fellow Americans in the North Vietnamese prison camp where he was imprisoned and tortured for five years.

McCain’s greatest passion was for defending America. He spent endless hours trying to strengthen our military and to develop and implement effective strategies for national security.

When McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee he asked me to join a small group that included retired Gen. Jim Mattis to discuss strategic planning for defense.

John was always pushing the margins, looking for new ideas and trying to find better ways to do things.

The Arizona senator was a maverick in the Republican Party, in his approach to being a senator, and in his relationship with presidents. This was good for America. We need a few more mavericks, not a few more conformists.

McCain understood that the Constitution was designed to have a strong Senate that could stand up to the executive branch. In a series of policy fights he was prepared again and again to use his senatorial powers to take on the bureaucracy and the president.

McCain’s independence was bipartisan. He was prepared to take on President Bush and he was prepared to take on President Obama. That is how our Constitution is supposed to work.

For 81 years John McCain loved his country, lived his life as a patriot, and accepted hardships that few Americans have had to endure.

The depth and intensity of McCain’s patriotism, his love for America, and his deep commitment to our nation remaining a free country are an inspiration to every American.

His is a life worth studying and praising.",politics
"Justice Department official Bruce Ohr is set to testify Tuesday during a closed-door session of the House Oversight Committee, where he will face a grilling about his involvement with ex-British spy Christopher Steele—the author of the salacious Trump dossier.

Republicans will likely allege that Ohr played a pivotal role in selling the unverified dossier, created by Fusion GPS – where his wife Nellie ohr worked – and paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

The dossier was used by federal officials to justify the surveillance of a top Trump aide, Carter Page. Steele, an ex-British spy, was a key source cited by the FBI and Department of Justice to obtain a FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) warrant to monitor Page.

California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa told Fox News on Monday that Ohr’s testimony could be a “strong opportunity” to reveal information about his conversations with Steele. He added that Ohr should be suspended at least until the end of the investigation.

“I would certainly think that he should be relieved of all authorities and powers until this investigation has been completed at a minimum,” Issa said.

The hearing will focus on communications between Ohr and Steele, following revelations earlier this month that the pair extensively communicated, even after the FBI dropped Steele as a source in November 2016 over his contacts with the media.

DOJ’S BRUCE OHR WROTE CHRISTOPHER STEELE WAS ‘VERY CONCERNED ABOUT COMEY’S FIRING – AFRAID THEY WILL BE EXPOSED’

The Republican-led House Intelligence Committee found that Steele effectively used Ohr as a back channel for communications after the termination.

During recent congressional testimony, now-fired FBI agent Peter Strzok confirmed that ""the FBI received documents and material from Mr. Ohr.""

Texas Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe said the testimony on Tuesday could help shed a light on who else in the Justice Department or the FBI was aware of the unverified information laid out in the dossier and was then used to justify surveillance of a Trump campaign staffer.

“The Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told members of Congress under oath that he had no knowledge that Bruce Ohr was involved in the Russia investigation and he told members of Congress that he wasn’t aware Bruce Ohr had permission to be working on the investigation,” he said.

“But we know very clear, that is not in dispute, that Bruce Ohr had more than 60 contacts with Christopher Steele and his wife was retained and paid to create the dossier with Christopher Steele,” the congressman continued.

The documents also show that as the ex-British spy was shopping around the dossier to multiple media outlets, he also asked Ohr to help with a Russian oligarch – Oleg Deripaska – amid speculations that the U.S. might impose sanctions.

One of Ohr’s notes also suggested that in December 2016, Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson met with him. “Glen(n) gave me a memory stick,” wrote Ohr.

President Trump seized on the revelations, slamming it as more proof that the investigation into his campaign for the alleged collusion with the Russian government is a “witch hunt” against him.

“DOJ’s Emails & Notes show Bruce Ohr’s connection to (phony & discredited) Trump Dossier,"" Trump tweeted. ""A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act. Rigged Witch Hunt!”",politics

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Sunday that President Trump's refusal to endorse a communique from the Group of Seven (G7) leaders was ""sobering and a bit depressing.""

Merkel made the remark during an interview with Germany's ARD television broadcaster following the conclusion of the summit in Quebec.

In the same interview, Merkel said the European Union was preparing to implement counter-measures against U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on imported aluminum from the EU on June 1, a move he said was meant to protect U.S. national security.

After leaving the summit Saturday, Trump announced that the U.S. was pulling back its endorsement of the G7 communique in part because of what he called ""false statements"" at a news conference by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

A few hours earlier, Trudeau had told reporters that all seven leaders had come together to sign the joint declaration.

Trump tweeted: ""Based on Justin's false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!""

Late Sunday, Trump tweeted from Singapore that ""Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal.""

""According to a Canada release, they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). Minimum is 17B. Tax Dairy from us at 270%. Then Justin acts hurt when called out!""

Meantime, French President Emmanuel Macron responded by saying international partnerships could not be ""dictated by fits of anger and throwaway remarks,"" the BBC reported.

Trump had delivered a stark warning to America's trading partners not to counter his decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But the summit host, Trudeau, whose nation was among those singled out by Trump, pushed back and said he would not hesitate to retaliate against his neighbor to the south.

""If they retaliate, they're making a mistake,"" Trump declared before departing the annual Group of Seven summit, which includes Britain, Italy, France, Germany and Japan.

Trudeau later said he reiterated to Trump that tariffs will harm industries and workers on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border. He said unleashing retaliatory measures ""is not something I relish doing"" but that he wouldn't hesitate to do so because ""I will always protect Canadian workers and Canadian interests.""

""As Canadians, we are polite, we're reasonable, but also we will not be pushed around,"" Trudeau said.

Despite the sharp differences, Trudeau said all seven leaders had come together to sign a joint declaration despite having ""some strong, firm conversations on trade, and specifically on American tariffs.""

During a rare solo news conference earlier Saturday, Trump said he pressed for the G7 countries to eliminate all tariffs, trade barriers and subsidies in their trading practices. He reiterated his longstanding view that the U.S. has been taken advantage of in global trade, adding, ""We're like the piggy bank that everybody's robbing, and that ends.""

He said U.S. farmers had been harmed by tariffs and other barriers and warned that U.S. trading partners would need to provide him with more favorable terms: ""It's going to stop or we'll stop trading with them.""

"U.S. Sen. John McCain, a war hero who survived five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, served three decades in Congress and went on to become the Republican Party’s nominee for president in 2008, died Saturday. He was 81 years old.

In his last hours, the Arizona Republican turned down further medical treatment, his family announced in a statement.

McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer in July 2017. Doctors discovered the tumor during a medical procedure to remove a blood clot from above his left eye. He remained upbeat after the diagnosis, flying back to Washington days after surgery with a large scar visible above his eye to partake in the Senate’s health care debate.

“I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support - unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I'll be back soon, so stand-by!” McCain tweeted on July 20 after his diagnosis.

On Friday, his family issued a statement saying,“Last summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: he had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict.""

They added, ""With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.""

McCain's wife, Cindy, tweeted that her ""heart is broken"" following her husband's death.

""I am so lucky to have lived the adventure of loving this incredible man for 38 years,"" she said. ""He passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the the place he loved best.""

The senator's daughter, Meghan, posted a heartfelt note online, in which she said the ""task of [her] lifetime is to live up to [McCain's] example, his expectations, and his love.""

""My father is gone, and I miss him as only an adoring daughter can,"" she wrote. ""He was a great fire who burned bright, and we lives in his light and warmth for so very long. We know that his flame lives on, in each of us. The days and years to come will not be the same without my dad — but they will be good days, filled with life and love, because of the example he lived for us.""

McCain was born in 1936 in the Panama Canal Zone, where his father was stationed in the Navy. After graduating from the Naval Academy in 1958, McCain went to Vietnam.

In 1967, his A4 Skyhawk was hit by a surface-to-air missile over Hanoi. McCain was captured by the North Vietnamese, who tortured and beat him for more than five years. He was in solitary confinement for several of those years.

“My room was fairly decent-sized - I’d say about 10 by 10,” McCain would later write. “The door was solid. There were no windows. The only ventilation came from two small holes at the top in the ceiling, about 6 inches by 4 inches. The roof was tin, and it got hot as hell in there.”

His captors offered him early release after learning his father was a notable naval officer. But McCain refused to leave before the other prisoners. He was released in 1973.

McCain’s injuries from his imprisonment were visible the rest of his life, most noticeably the restricted movement of his arms.

McCain got a taste of politics in 1976, when he served as the Navy’s liaison to the Senate.

In 1982, McCain was elected to the House of Representatives. Only a few years later, in 1986, he won the race to replace Arizona’s conservative Sen. Barry Goldwater.

He was implicated in what became known as the Keating Five Scandal in 1989, accused with several other lawmakers of helping the owner of the Lincoln Savings and Loan, who had donated to his campaign.

McCain ran twice for president. In 2000, he ran for the Republican nomination for president, winning New Hampshire’s primary but losing the nomination to George W. Bush.

In 2008, he defeated a host of Republican candidates to win the GOP nomination for president.

He was responsible for introducing then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to a national audience by tapping her as his running mate. The McCain-Palin ticket went on to lose the general election to Barack Obama, who became the country’s first black president.

For years, McCain declined to call his choice of Palin a mistake. But in his upcoming book, “The Restless Wave,” McCain reportedly writes that he regrets not choosing his friend, then-U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., as his running mate, calling it “another mistake that I made.” Lieberman, the 2000 Democratic nominee for vice president, was an independent who caucused with Democrats.

After the 2008 loss, McCain returned to the Senate, embracing his role as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

During his last years in politics, he had a complicated relationship with President Trump, who infamously attacked McCain during the GOP primary. In May, the McCain family was offended when it was reported that Trump aide Kelly Sadler dismissed McCain's opposition to the president’s choice for CIA director by quipping during a private meeting, ""It doesn't matter, he's dying anyway.""

According to the New York Times, McCain has made clear to the White House he doesn’t want Trump to attend his funeral, and would instead prefer Vice President Mike Pence at a service.

"Michael Friedman never imagined that naming his restaurant The Red Hen would be so controversial.

But when the co-owner of another restaurant named The Red Hen – this one almost 200 miles away in Lexington, Va. – refused to serve White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on Friday night, it was open season on any eatery with Hen in its name.

“It was a bit of an interesting day yesterday,” Friedman told Fox News. “There were so many negative comments floating in on social media and people calling up my restaurants to threaten us.”

The foul play began when Sanders tweeted that she was told by the owner of the Red Hen in Lexington, Va., that she had to ""leave because I work for @POTUS and I politely left."" She said the episode Friday evening said far more about the owner of the restaurant than it did about her.

""I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so,"" Sanders said in the tweet from her official account, which generated 22,000 replies in about an hour.

While Friedman tried to quickly quell any bird-brained backlash mistakenly directed at his Italian-influenced restaurant by posting on its social media accounts that his eatery had no affiliation to the one in Lexington, it did little to stop the flood of angry comments and calls. One person called up one of Friedman’s other restaurants and threatened to blow it up, while another just repeated the word “shame” over and over again.

“This is a huge misconception,” Friedman said. “We are not affiliated with the restaurant in Lexington; this is not a franchise. We serve whoever walks through out door, no matter their race, creed, sexual orientation, political party or whatever.”

Friedman’s restaurant wasn’t the only restaurant named The Red Hen to erroneously take heat following Sanders getting the boot in Lexington.

In Swedesboro, N.J., a family-style restaurant by the same name was also lambasted by supporters of President Trump – receiving about 200 phone calls and seeing their Facebook rating plummet to 1-star. The eatery was also finally forced to go to social media to clear up the issue.

""THE RED HEN IN SWEDESBORO, NEW JERSEY IS IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH THE RED HEN IN VIRGINIA,” a post on the New Jersey restaurant's Facebook page states. ""Kindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent business on Facebook.""

Sanders’ dilemma in Lexington is just the latest is a series of bad nights out for members of Trump’s administration.

Earlier in the week, Trump's Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, cut short a working dinner at a Mexican restaurant in Washington after protesters shouted, ""Shame!"" until she left. A few days earlier, Trump aide Stephen Miller, a key adviser on immigration, was accosted by someone at a different Mexican restaurant in the city, who called him ""a fascist,"" according to the New York Post.

In Lexington – a spot of blue in a sea of red that sided with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election by a 2-1 margin – most local business owners sided with The Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson giving a brusque reception to Sanders.

Tom Lomax, who owns a local business, called Wilkinson a ""force of nature"" and ""one of the biggest drivers of the downtown.""

""We support our own here, great little community we have,"" he said.

Stephen Russek, a former restaurant owner in the area, however, said ""they had no right to do that.""

""You have your political opinions, you don't throw somebody out of your restaurant,"" Russek, who lives nearby, said. ""They ought to be shut down.""

Wilkinson told The Washington Post that her staff had called her to report Sanders was in the restaurant. She cited several reasons, including the concerns of several restaurant employees who were gay and knew Sanders had defended Trump's desire to bar transgender people from the military.

""Tell me what you want me to do. I can ask her to leave,"" Wilkinson told her staff, she said. ""They said yes.""",politics
"President Trump weighed in on the recent string of shootings in Chicago on Thursday, labeling the bloodshed that’s left at least 11 people dead and 70 others injured an “absolute and total disaster.”

Speaking at a prison reform roundtable at his golf club in Bedminister, New Jersey, alongside governors and state attorneys general, the president laid much of the blame for the violence at the feet of the city’s leadership.

“We must strengthen community bonds with law enforcement including cities like Chicago, that have been an absolute and total disaster,” Trump said. “We’ll be talking about Chicago today because that is something that – in terms of our nation – nobody would believe it could be happening.

“Bad stuff happening,” Trump continued. “And probably, I guess you have to take from the leadership. It’s called bad leadership. There’s no reason in a million years that something like that should be happening in Chicago.”

Mayor Rahm Emanuel is battling calls for his resignation amid the uptick in violence in Chicago. Hip-hop artist Chance the Rapper, long-time Emanuel critic Rev. Gregory Livingston and around 200 protesters – who briefly shut down Chicago's Lake Shore Drive on Aug. 2 – all recently have called for Emanuel to step down.

""Our souls are burdened,"" Emanuel said in response. ""It is unacceptable to happen in any neighborhood of Chicago. We are a better city.""

Thursday’s meeting in New Jersey was largely with officials representing states that have implemented changes similar to those backed by the president, the White House said.

The administration has been pressing Congress to send Trump legislation that would provide the Bureau of Prisons with $50 million over the next five years for drug treatment, education and job-skills programs. Trump said the administration has felt ""very, very strongly"" about helping former inmates find jobs.

“We want every child to grow up in a safe neighborhood, surrounded by families that are loving and helpful and with a path to great education and a life-long career,” Trump said.

"Fourteen Cambodian opposition activists were freed Tuesday from long prison terms, their pardons coming as the latest in a series of releases engineered by Prime Minister Hun Sen after his party's election sweep last month.

The 14 former members of the now-disbanded opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party were convicted of insurrection in connection with a street protest four years ago that turned violent. By many accounts, the violence was started by pro-government agitators, and the arrests of the opposition members were seen as political persecution.

Those freed Tuesday were serving prison terms ranging from seven to 20 years, the longer sentences given to those seen as leaders of the July 15, 2014, protest in Phnom Penh. It had been held as opposition lawmakers were boycotting parliament to demand political reforms, saying the previous year's election had been rigged by Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party.

Tuesday's releases came at about 1 a.m., a move that seemed intended to keep supporters from gathering publicly to welcome them. A court spokesman said the pardons were signed Monday by King Norodom Sihamoni at the request of Hun Sen.

At least eight other people held on political charges have been freed with pardons or on bail since the beginning of last week.

The acts of clemency came after the July 29 general election, in which Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won all 125 National Assembly seats. The polls were heavily criticized inside and outside Cambodia as unfair, because pro-government courts last year dissolved the Cambodian National Rescue Party, the only credible opposition grouping.

In the run-up to the election, there was a crackdown on Hun Sen's political foes and the media that crippled the opposition. Hun Sen, who has been in office since 1985, has a record of cracking down harshly when facing a serious challenge, then easing up when he no longer feels threatened.

A repentant appeal for pardons issued Friday by the 14, along with a conciliatory statement calling for national unity from the most prominent prisoner, former opposition spokesman Meach Sovannara, after his release, suggested that the latest release was carefully orchestrated by the government. Early last week, Hun Sen hinted broadly that they would be released soon.

There has been a major exception to the latest releases. Last week, the former leader of the opposition party, Kem Sokha, was denied his request to be released on bail. He has been in prison awaiting trial since last November, when he was arrested on the charge of treason for allegedly plotting with U.S. backing to overthrow the government. The charge is regarded more as politically motivated than based on fact.

Am Sam Ath, a member of the Cambodian human rights group Licadho, said there may be another opportunity on Thursday for Kem Sokha to gain his freedom, when a closed-door hearing will be held at his prison in eastern Cambodia to determine whether to renew his pre-trial detention period.",world
"A Japanese woman mourned the death of her husband, whom she believed was found dead in a river, only to be stunned nearly a year later when her spouse returned very much alive at her doorstep.

Tokyo police said a body of a man — initially believed to be in his 40s — was discovered in the Edo River in the city’s Katsushika Ward in June 2017, three days after the unidentified woman reported her husband missing. The wife, along with two relatives, went to police and “positively” identified the man as a family member.

The family cremated the body.

The “dead” man, however, suddenly showed up at the family’s home in May.

It’s unclear where the Japanese woman’s husband has been for the last 11 months.

Tokyo police on Wednesday admitted there was a mix-up between two missing men — one who was in his 30s and another in his 40s. Police believe the body belonged with the man in his 30s and had drowned in the river.

Authorities have since confirmed the man’s identity to the correct person after matching fingerprints filed in a missing person report, Japanese news site The Mainichi reported.

""The incident is extremely regrettable. We're determined to prevent a recurrence,"" a senior officer told the site.

The body might have been misidentified because both men were about the same height and age, Tokyo's metropolitan police said. Bodies that are deemed unrelated to crime are usually returned to the families only after their visual inspections and without additional tests.

"The Justice Department asked its watchdog to look into any alleged ""impropriety or political motivation"" in the FBI's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, the DOJ said Sunday night -- hours after President Trump ordered a review looking into whether federal agents infiltrated or surveilled his campaign for political purposes.

""I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes -- and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!"" the president tweeted.

""The Department has asked the Inspector General to expand the ongoing review of the (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) application process to include determining whether there was any impropriety or political motivation in how the FBI conducted its counterintelligence investigation of persons suspected of involvement with the Russian agents who interfered in the 2016 presidential election. As always, the Inspector General will consult with the appropriate U.S. Attorney if there is any evidence of potential criminal conduct,"" DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told Fox News.

She also released a response from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein: ""If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action.""

Trump, late last week, began accusing the Justice Department of trying to frame him by planting a spy in his campaign -- an allegation his own lawyer said might not be true.

Promoting a theory that is circulating, Trump quoted Fox Business anchor David Asman and tweeted Friday: ""Apparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign. This has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn't commit.""

But Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani cast some doubt on that.

On whether there was an ""informant"" in the 2016 presidential campaign, Giuliani told CNN, ""I don't know for sure, nor does the president, if there really was one,"" though he said they have long been told there was ""some kind of infiltration.""

Earlier this month, the National Review raised the question of a possible FBI spy in Trump's campaign. The article cites work by California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, an ardent Trump supporter and head of the House Intelligence Committee, who has demanded information on an FBI source in the Russia investigation.

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee as its vice chairman, objected Friday to such demands, emphasizing ""the critical importance of protecting sources and methods.""

""It would be at best irresponsible, and at worst potentially illegal, for members of Congress to use their positions to learn the identity of an FBI source for the purpose of undermining the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in our election,"" Warner wrote in a statement. ""Anyone who is entrusted with our nation's highest secrets should act with the gravity and seriousness of purpose that knowledge deserves.""

The New York Times reported separately this past week that at least one government informant met several times with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, both former foreign policy advisers for Trump's Republican campaign.

The Times reported Friday that the informant talked to Page and Papadopoulos because they had suspicious contacts linked to Russia. The newspaper attributed the information to current and former FBI officials.

Also Friday, Giuliani said special counsel Robert Mueller has narrowed his possible interview subject areas from five to two as negotiations continue over whether the president will sit down and answer questions in the Russia investigation.

Mueller is investigating possible coordination between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.

A number of Trump outside advisers -- including former chief strategist Stephen Bannon -- have stepped up their attacks on the Department of Justice, calling for it to release more documents to the White House while saying a confidential source has worked against Trump.

"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wants to rename the Russell Senate Office Building after the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

Yet, in a strange twist of irony, many progressive ideals which serve as touchstones of today’s Democratic Party and the progressive movement may not exist were it not for the building’s namesake, Sen. Richard Russell, D-Ga.

Three Senate office buildings sit across the street from the U.S. Capitol, linked by an underground network of tunnels. The newest is the Hart Senate Office Building, named after Sen. Phil Hart, D-Mich. -- the “conscience of the Senate.” Then there’s the Dirksen Senate Office Building, the namesake of longtime Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, R-Ill. Closest to the Capitol is the Russell Senate Office Building. Russell is the oldest of the trio, opened in 1909.

Thirty-five senators and six committees maintain offices in Russell. The structure holds the suite used by McCain and the Armed Services Committee, which he chaired.

Richard Russell served for 38 years in the Senate. A staunch anti-communist, Russell also led the Armed Services Committee. Russell never served as a Senate majority or minority leader. But there’s a reason for that: Russell didn’t need to. He committed to memory all of the Senate’s rules. He could convince fellow senators to vote for bills they otherwise opposed. The idea of a majority or minority leader was a new concept in the Senate in the early 20th century. The Senate is a body of equals. That’s why Senate Majority Leaders Alben Barkley, D-Ky., Scott Lucas, D-Ill., and Ernest McFarland, D-Ariz., struggled. They held the title. But none radiated the political wattage of Richard Russell.

During his time on Capitol Hill, no one commanded all of the Senate’s folkways, methods and procedures quite like Russell.

And here’s the bad part: Russell was a racist and segregationist. He filibustered civil rights bills. He fought legislation banning public lynchings.

“We believe the system of segregation … is a reason to preserve peace and harmony between the races” said Russell, as quoted in Robert Caro’s book “Master of the Senate.”

Russell’s views on race are why Schumer and other Democrats want to rename the building after McCain.

“It is only fitting that his name should adorn a physical institution of the Senate, particularly one that housed the Armed Services Committee,” said Schumer.

But it’s just not Democrats who want to change the name.

“Having a building named after (McCain) makes a lot of sense to me,” said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the lone African American Republican in the Senate.

“I’m great with that,” said Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., when asked about Schumer’s proposal. “I loved John McCain. He was a good friend and a mentor. He took me under his wing.”

But not everyone’s on board, including lawmakers from Georgia.

Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., accused Schumer of playing politics.

“McCain just passed away. We need to take a deep breath,” said Perdue.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., wants to name something after McCain for time immemorial.

“I don’t want to establish the precedent that we can un-honor somebody in the future,” said Cassidy.

In other words, if they can strip the name “Richard Russell” off the Russell Senate Office Building, why couldn’t that happen to the “McCain Senate Office Building” in the future?

“I’d name the Capitol after the old guy if I could,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

Graham also suggested naming the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) after the Arizona Republican.

“John hated it. He thought it was a waste of money,” said Graham, noting with a chuckle that bestowing the CVC with the McCain moniker might be “my last way to get at him.”

But Graham says a lot of the focus seems misplaced at a time of mourning.

“Instead of worrying about what to name for him - which we should name something or a bunch of things -- let’s try to be more like him,” suggested Graham.

The Russell Senate Office Building wasn’t always named after Richard Russell. It was initially just the Senate Office Building – because it was the only one. Some called it the “SOB” for short.

Perhaps that’s a dig at Russell. And, considering the original “SOB” moniker, one McCain friend told Fox that naming the building after McCain would fit the late senator perfectly.

But here’s why Russell was important:

Take a look at the aforementioned “Master of the Senate” by Robert Caro. The 1,100-page magnum opus details how Lyndon Baines Johnson truly became the master of the Senate as no one had really done before him. Remember those other Senate leaders who lacked the chops? Guess who arrived on the scene who did? Lyndon Johnson. Johnson went on to become one of the most-powerful Senate leaders of all-time. The only others who come close are Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., Bob Dole, R-Kan., Howard Baker, R-Tenn., and Mike Mansfield, D-Mont.

For good or ill, when Johnson became president, he successfully advanced his “Great Society” programs through Congress. That included passing landmark civil rights legislation, waging a “war on poverty.” Congress approved legislation creating the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Johnson signed laws on consumer protection and housing. He corralled the votes to create the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and launched public broadcasting.

How did Johnson achieve this? Well, he learned the Senate and developed his bona fides from Richard Russell.

Russell could have moved into a vacant leadership post any time he wanted. But he didn’t want to get bogged down in details. In 1951, Johnson became the Senate Democratic Whip. The sole reason? As Caro writes, Johnson had the backing of “one man,” Richard Russell. Two years later, Johnson became Democratic Leader.

In order to understand Johnson, one must dig deeply into Russell. Caro does so in his tour de force, devoting an entire chapter to the Georgia Democrat: “A Russell of the Russells of Georgia.” It was Russell’s own mastery of the Senate which partly helped President Franklin Delano Roosevelt muscle through his own legislative program during the Great Depression: “The New Deal.”

Russell espoused views on race which are offensive today. But were it not for Richard Russell, and later, his agent Lyndon Johnson, major tenets of the Democratic party’s platform would not be law today.

It’s unclear if Schumer and others will get their way and rename the Russell building after McCain. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is empaneling a bipartisan “gang” to determine the proper way to honor McCain.

“In addition to getting things done, he also wanted to get them through in the regular order,” said Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt, R-Mo., of his fallen colleague. “I’m sure the Senate will find a way to honor him.”

One senior Senate source tells Fox they think the Senate should name something “new” after McCain. That may yet happen.

Democrats will talk a lot of preserving major New Deal and Great Society programs on the campaign trail this fall. Richard Russell doesn’t align with contemporary views on race. But the party and the country would look a little different today if it weren’t for him and his protégé Lyndon Johnson.",politics

Thousands of hard-line Islamists angered over a far-right Dutch lawmaker's plans to hold a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest marched toward Pakistan's capital Thursday after police briefly stopped them because of security reasons.

Some 10,000 supporters of the Tehreek-i-Labaik group, which helped Imran Khan to become prime minister following last month's national elections, set out on the march Wednesday, calling on Khan to cut diplomatic ties with the Netherlands.

The demonstrators were expected to camp out near Islamabad later Thursday.

Physical depictions of the prophet are forbidden in Islam and deeply offensive to Muslims. Pakistan's government has vowed to protest the contest at the U.N.

Authorities are blocking the capital's key roads by putting out shipping containers to prevent demonstrators from reaching near the area where the Dutch and other foreign embassies are located.

Earlier, police halted the march in Jhelum, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from Islamabad but later it was allowed to resume, party spokesman Eijaz Ashrafi told The Associated Press.

He said they refused to disperse, saying the police will have to ""kill us"" to stop the march.

Ashrafi said they told Khan's government that it had two options: Cut diplomatic ties with the Netherlands or kill them and ""send our dead bodies to Lahore.""

""So far, better sense has prevailed,"" he said. ""We are 50 miles away from Islamabad.""

The party's firebrand chief Khadim Hussain Rizvi in Jhelum also warned Khan to remove any hurdles.

""We are on roads to show to the world that we can die to protect the honor of our Prophet,"" he told demonstrators.

The rally comes as emotions are running high in Pakistan against the cartoon contest.

The cartoon contest is being organized by Geert Wilders, a Dutch lawmaker with a history of inflammatory statements about Islam. The Dutch government has distanced itself from the contest but says it is committed to upholding the right to free speech.

Also on Thursday, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Faisal said Islamabad conveyed its deep concern to Netherlands over the planned cartoon contest. He said the contest was a ""deliberate and malicious attempt to defame Islam.""

Faisal said Pakistan would avoid any unnecessary extreme action against Netherlands over the contest.",world
"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife are making their first major foray into politics with a $10 million contribution to a super PAC that aims to elect military veterans to Congress.

The contribution introduces Mr. Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, to a class of political megadonors that includes Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and California billionaire Tom Steyer, who have each poured more than $100 million into elections over the past decade.

But unlike with Messrs. Adelson and Steyer, the Bezos contribution isn’t to a partisan political organization. Instead it is to With Honor Fund, a year-old super PAC that backs veterans of both major parties who are running for House seats. Federal Election Commission filings show the organization had raised $7 million between its launch last October and the end of July.

Rye Barcott, the founder of With Honor Fund, said the Bezoses shared his group’s goal of building a “cross-partisan coalition” of House members willing to work with the other party.

“They perceive themselves to be pretty nonpartisan,” Mr. Barcott said. “The idea of doing something different and disruptive appealed to them, along with our focus on values and integrity in our national discourse.”

A Bezos spokesman confirmed the contribution and said the Amazon chief executive and his wife, MacKenzie, declined to comment.

With Honor Fund is backing 33 House candidates now running—19 Democrats and 14 Republicans. Mr. Barcott said the PAC does “no screening for ideology,” but rather seeks out a “common bond of service and commitment to the country.”

In a New Hampshire House race, With Honor’s ads backing Democrat Maura Sullivan show President Trump’s face as it says she will back “affordable health care...no matter who stands in the way.But in an ad for Michael Waltz, the GOP nominee for a House seat in northeast Florida, With Honor says Mr. Waltz will “work with President Trump to fight for Florida’s conservative values.”

Mr. Barcott said With Honor Fund backs candidates who agree to its three-point pledge, which calls for integrity, civility and courage.

Other major With Honor contributors include Leslie Wexner, the CEO of the company that owns Victoria’s Secret, and his wife, Abigail Wexner, who gave a combined $2.8 million. Mr. Bezos’s parents gave the super PAC $2 million.

Mr. Bezos, whom Forbes magazine in March ranked as the world’s richest man with a net worth of more than $150 billion, has to this point not been an active campaign donor.

FEC data shows that since 2007 the couple has given $52,600 to federal candidates—$31,000 of that went to Democrats and $21,600 to Republicans.

They have also given $170,000 to PACs associated with Amazon and Blue Origin, a Bezos-owned aerospace manufacturer.”

In Washington state, where the Bezoses live, the couple gave $2.5 million to back a 2012 referendum to legalize same-sex marriage. Beyond that, they have given just $8,400 to state-level candidates.

Mr. Bezos joins a roster of American billionaires who have spent tens of millions of dollars backing candidates.

This year Mr. Adelson and his wife gave $55 million to the super PACs backing House and Senate Republicans. Richard Uihlein, an Illinois shipping magnate, has spent $31 million this year on federal candidates and PACs and millions more on state-level races.

Mr. Steyer, who advocates impeaching Mr. Trump, has spent $30 million so far on Democratic candidates and PACs.

And former New York City Mayor Michael Bloombergsignaled in June that he would spend $80 million to elect Democrats in 2018, but FEC records show he has given just $1 million so far. Bloomberg spokesman Howard Wolfson said Tuesday that Mr. Bloomberg still plans to spend to back Democrats.

"In the middle of the liberal media’s desperate efforts to convince us that President Trump is in trouble, there are an amazing number of victories that suggest he is winning. In fact, there are indications that he is winning a lot.

Let’s start with Tuesday’s primaries. In Florida, a fine, well-entrenched state Agriculture Commissioner and former U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam decisively lost the Republican gubernatorial primary to Rep. Ron DeSantis. The big boost for DeSantis came from President Trump’s endorsement and a Trump robocall to Florida Republicans.

The contest for governor of our third-most populous state shaped up even better for Republicans as a hard-left Bernie Sanders-backed progressive – Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum – won the Democratic primary with 34 percent of the vote. The contrast between a pro-Trump DeSantis and Gillum will probably keep Florida in Republican hands in November.

Florida gave President Trump and Republicans a second boost as GOP Gov. Rick Scott won an important primary victory for a U.S. Senate seat. Scott has proven in his two campaigns for governor that he is an aggressive, effective campaigner. It is very likely the blue wave in Florida will disappear with the DeSantis and Scott victories.

It is clear that the president’s judicial and economic victories build his prestige, and that prestige is giving him the muscle to reshape the Republican Party.

In Arizona, President Trump won another primary victory when Martha McSally, a congresswoman and Air Force veteran (in fact, the first American woman to fly a fighter jet in combat) won the Republican U.S. Senate nomination.

President Trump praised McSally earlier this month at the signing ceremony for the National Defense Authorization Act. What looked at one time to be a close contest became a blowout, as McSally won 52 percent of the vote in a three-way race and was 24 points ahead of her closest competitor. Republican chances of keeping the Arizona seat are dramatically better with McSally as the nominee.

Beyond the primaries, President Trump has been winning amazing victories in nominating – and with the leadership of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., getting the Senate to confirm – federal judges. Where Hillary Clinton would have nominated radical judges, President Trump has been consistently nominating constitutional conservatives to the courts. This will have a profound impact on America’s future.

So far, President Trump and McConnell have confirmed 60 federal judges – this includes Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, 33 district court judges, and 26 court of appeals judges.

Additionally, President Trump has nominated more than 80 other judges across the federal system (including Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh). McConnell has been doggedly working to get these nominees confirmed, and I suspect he will drive them through the Senate before the end of the year.

So on judges, President Trump is winning an amazing victory for conservatism. No wonder the left is in a frenzy.

Finally, the breakthrough in trade negotiations with Mexico is, to use one of President Trump’s favorite words, huge.

Most of the so-called experts had said the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) couldn’t be renegotiated. They insisted President Trump had offended Mexicans so much with his harsh language that the Mexican government wouldn’t come to the table. They asserted building the border wall would alienate the Mexican leaders. They were just plain wrong.

President Trump’s progress on NAFTA sends five big signals:



Making good on a big, disruptive pledge that set his 2016 campaign apart from every other candidate, the president kept his word and is forcing a difficult negotiation toward success.

President Trump proved, once again, that tough language and tough negotiating can actually lead to breakthroughs. Unlike most politicians, Trump is willing to endure heat to achieve success.

As a result of his seriousness on trade, other countries are now approaching President Trump about trade negotiations (note German Chancellor Merkel’s call this week for trade talks).

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tried to be clever when he ambushed and attempted to embarrass President Trump during a press conference at the G-7 Summit in Canada. Trudeau is now discovering that Trump has a good memory. Canada now has virtually no leverage in trying to play catch-up with the U.S.-Mexico negotiations.

The Trump administration’s continued attention to economic matters – despite the liberal media’s daily efforts to get him and his team off-balance through dishonest reporting and smear stories – is paying off. The average American sees the economy getting better and better. And the average American increasingly thinks the success is due to President Trump.

It is clear that the president’s judicial and economic victories build his prestige, and that prestige is giving him the muscle to reshape the Republican Party.

It is an amazing story. No one in the liberal mainstream media apparently understands, but historians will look back on this period in amazement.

They will clearly see a political-cultural battle between an aggressive, effective, successful president and a disoriented, defeated and demoralized news media.

Clearly, President Trump is winning.",politics

Esports organizers say don't blame the games.

Executives at the Asian Games have expressed sympathy for the victims of the deadly shooting at a video game tournament in a Florida shopping mall. But Kenneth Fok, president of the Asian Electronic Sports Federation, said the shooting was more a reflection of U.S. gun laws than the gaming community.

U.S. authorities say 24-year-old David Katz of Baltimore killed two people and wounded nine others before fatally shooting himself Sunday at a Madden tournament being held at a riverfront mall in Jacksonville.

""Of course tragedies like this should never happen. One is already too many,"" Fok told a news conference Wednesday about the introduction of esports at the Asian Games. ""But I think this is a bigger issue of gun control and access to guns.

""This very unfortunate incident happened in a video game arena, but does this mean that it's esports or video games to blame? I don't believe so. It's not esports that caused this. We're really saddened to see this take place.""

While several U.S.-based esports organizers have called for better security at events since Sunday's shooting, Indian Gaming League founder and AESF vice-president Lokesh Suji said problems such as the shooting in Florida hadn't occurred in Asia, where the vast bulk of esports and gaming is focused.

""Tell me about one incident where this has happened in Asia,"" said Suji, adding that drawing comparisons between gaming and violence ""is the wrong perspective.""

""We've never had this in this part of the world. Why are things happening in the U.S.?"" Suji said. ""It's very sad. Every time something like this happens in the U.S., people start blaming the video games. The bigger picture, the bigger problem is gun control.""

Esports made its competitive debut this week as a demonstration sport at the Asian Games, which has attracted more than 11,000 athletes in 40 sports. The arena was packed for the esports debut and the reception was good, leading organizers to be positive about being considered as a medal sport for the next Asian Games in China in 2022 and ultimately at the Olympics.

Fok said the gaming community and the burgeoning industry was paying attention to concerns such as addiction, and believes those can be addressed by education and regulation as competitive gaming edges further into the mainstream.

""It is a high-stress environment. We have to protect athletes as well,"" Fok said. ""As we grow, we have to look at the overall well-being of all our athletes.""

Mike Morhaime, the CEO of Blizzard Entertainment, an American video games developer, told a recent International Olympic Committee forum that esports has 2 billion people worldwide playing electronic games, with 380 million watching esports.

"Of all the polarizing issues dividing our country today, guns remain among the most contentious.

No one has perfect answers for how to lessen gun violence in the United States, while preserving the rights granted in the Second Amendment to the Constitution. But it’s clear that the status quo is untenable.

In the past several years, we have seen far too many people killed and wounded in shootings in schools, churches, concerts, nightclubs and many other places across the nation.

Yet Americans haven’t been able to agree on what to do next and on how far new gun measures should go. Still, no one wants to accept the current level of gun violence as a given anywhere in today’s America – whether in Chicago or Parkland, Florida.

Former Democratic U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in the head and suffered permanent injuries in 2011, heads an anti-gun violence group called Giffords, along with her husband, retired astronaut Captain Mark Kelly.

The group gave Fox News an early look at a new TV ad designed to bridge cultural and political divides on the issue of gun safety.

The organization is launching an ad campaign to highlight an important constituency that is becoming increasingly vocal in the gun debate: prominent U.S. military leaders and veterans.

The new ad features retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who experienced war firsthand during his over 37 years in Army.

In the first scene, Hertling opens a box on his desk containing 253 cards with the names and photos of soldiers under his command who were killed in combat. He ties the pain he felt on their deaths to the pain parents must feel losing a child to gun violence.

It is immediately clear then that this is a new kind of gun safety advocate.

This ad is one in a series of five narrated by retired military leaders. The Giffords group is planning veterans’ events around the country to foster discussion on the gun issue.

So why are these retired members of the military getting involved in such a contentious debate now, and why so publicly?

“We’ve all seen the tragedy associated with gun violence up close and personal and we’ve all used weapons, we all own weapons, and we all believe in the Second Amendment, ”Hertling told me in an interview. He will also join “Benson & Harf” on Fox News Radio this Tuesday between 6 and 8 p.m. EDT.

“But we also understand,” Hertling continued, “that we are plagued by this disease of gun violence, and we really need to do something about it.”

This new ad campaign is worth paying attention to, especially for gun owners who might otherwise be hesitant to consider the message. It could be significant for the gun debate moving forward, because the ads rely on the words of nonpartisan military leaders who can’t be dismissed as “liberals who just don’t understand gun culture.”

Hertling, for example, has never identified as a member of any political party. That’s an important fact that could help overcome the caricatures each side has about the other in the gun debate and bridge some of the often nasty divide that leads many people to simply retreat to their corners.

“We’re all guys who know how to solve problems and know that even the toughest problems you can’t just take sides on, you have to build consensus and find solutions,” Hertling told me. “This is a problem in America, and the data proves it. To just put up a wall and say: ‘We’re not going to listen to anybody that we might assume is attempting to adjust our Second Amendment rights’ is not understanding what the problem is.”

Interestingly, some previous skeptics have begun trending towards more openness to possible gun reforms, after mass shootings have continued to fill the news.

This appears in part to be a reaction against the increasingly partisan and strident tone of some gun organizations like the National Rifle Association, which used to operate on a more bipartisan basis.

Military veterans like those in the Giffords campaign exemplify a subtle but important shift: members of a group that often resisted talking about the gun issue publicly now believe something different has to be done. They are willing to speak out in the hopes of prompting a better national conversation.

We all want to live without fear and we want our liberties and freedoms protected – all of them. We are a nation that always believes we can improve and do better. That idea is infused in our Constitution and in our DNA. Americans don’t throw in the towel and decide there are problems too big to be tackled – that’s not who we are.

BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: This is a Fox News alert.

President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin have concluded their summit in Finland. Shortly after, it wrapped up. ""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace had an exclusive one-on-one interview with the Russian president.

Here is that exclusive interview in its entirety right now.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR: President Putin -- thank you for speaking with us. I am going to get to some specifics about the summit in a moment, but let's begin with the big picture.

President Trump said in his news conference that our relationship has never been worse but that changed a few hours ago. How has the relationship, big picture, between the U.S. and Russia changed today?

RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN (through translator): Primarily, I think we should be grateful to our staff and our aides who spent several months working with one another and not just in the preparations of this summit.

I'm referring to the effort of our agencies across the board who worked in even the very sensitive areas, sensitive both for Russia and the United States. Primarily I refer to the counterterrorism efforts.

Today talking with President Trump, we agreed that terrorism is the greatest threat than it seems at first. Because God forbid if something happens, if there is a direct attack using the weapons of mass destruction -- if they get weapons of mass destruction -- it may have a devastating ramifications.

So our military, our special agencies do establish cooperation in this particularly important area. A case in point would be our cooperation in Syria. Although there are some understanding missing to some extent, especially in terms of broader picture but this cooperation is going on between the military, between the special services. That is our counterterrorism effort in the general sense of the word.

But then in 2021, the New START treaty is about to expire, so what are we going to do next? I reassured President Trump that Russia stands ready to extend this treaty, to prolong it, but we have to agree on the specifics at first because we have some questions to our American partners. We think that they are not fully compliant with the treaty, but this is for experts to decide.

We also discuss the Iranian nuclear program. We discussed what we can do to improve the situation with North Korea. I pointed out and I will point out again that I think that President Trump contributed a lot and he did a lot to settle this issue.

But in order to achieve complete denuclearization of the peninsula it will take international guarantees. And Russia stands ready to make its contribution to the extent what will be necessary.

So we can say that there are several issues of crucial importance for us. Based on some others we are starting to achieve some understanding, which gives us sufficient ground to say that some things -- a lot of things change to the better during today's meeting.

WALLACE: But do you see this summit as a turning point, and end of the effort by the West in recent years to isolate Russia?

PUTIN: I think you will see for yourself that this effort failed and they were never bound to succeed. I mean take a look at the scale, the sheer size of it, the importance of it in terms of international security and the economy, its contribution to the global energy market. It's too big to be sanctioned and isolated.

Speaking of the things that do unite us though, and the things that require our joint efforts, it brings us to the idea that such attempts to fight one another should be ended and rather look for ways to address common differences -- to address common issues and challenges; how to overcome this -- how to address this common concerns.

So I think this is the beginning of the path. This is a start. We did make a good start today.

WALLACE: Mr. President -- one of the issues that is standing in the way of more progress, as you know, are the allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. election. You have repeatedly said, and you said again today that this was not the action of the Russian state, that if it was anything, it was patriotic Russian individuals.

I have here the indictment that was presented on Friday from the special counsel Robert Mueller that says that 12 members of Russian military intelligence, the GRU, and they talk specifically about units 26, 165 and 74-455. They say -- you smile, let me finish -- they say that these units were specifically involved in hacking into Democratic Party computers, stealing information, and spreading it to the world to try to disrupt the American election.

May I give this to you to look at, sir? Here.

PUTIN: Well, let me start answering your question with something a little bit different. Let's have a look at it this way. People are talking about interference of Russia with the election process in the United States.

I have mentioned this in 2016 and I want to say it now again and I really wish for your American listeners to listen to what I say.

First of all, Russia as a state has never interfered with the internal affairs of the United States, let alone its elections.

WALLACE: But sir, this is the indictment. It shows -- I have 12 names here. It talks about specific units of the GRU, Russian military intelligence. Is the GRU not part of the Russian state?

PUTIN: I will get to it. Just have a little bit of patience and you will get a full answer to your question.

Interference with domestic affairs of the United States, do you really believe that someone acting from the Russian territory could have influenced the United States and influenced the choice of millions of Americans?

WALLACE: I'm not asking if they influenced -- I'm asking whether they tried.

PUTIN: I'm about to answer. This was the first point that I'm trying to make.

WALLACE: If you have some patience, you will hear the entire response.

I said this in 2016 and I say it now -- the idea was about hacking an e- mail account of a Democratic candidate. Was it rigging of facts? Was it some forgery of facts? That's the important thing that I'm trying -- point that I'm trying to make. Was there any false information planted? No, it wasn't.

These hackers that are being discussed -- I will get back to it, just bear with me for a moment. As we're getting told, they hacked a certain e-mail account and there was an information about manipulations conducted within the Democratic Party to incline the process in favor of one candidate and as far as I know the entire party leadership resigned.

They admitted the fact of their manipulation, so that's one thing. Manipulation of the public opinion should stop and an apology should be made to the public at large --

(CROSSTALK)

PUTIN: -- instead of looking for those responsible or the party at fault.

And now to the mentioned things -- As I said in the press conference --

WALLACE: But Mr. President, may I just say, you are indicating that they stole real money, not counterfeit money. So are you saying it's ok because of the fact that they took from the DNC, from John Podesta. It was their real e-mails, so it's ok to hack and spread this information out and interfere with the election?

PUTIN: Listen to me, please. The information that I am aware of, there's nothing false about it. Every single grain of it is true and the Democratic leadership admitted it, first point.

Now the second point, if you don't like my answer, you can give it to me straightaway, and I'll just keep silence. And if you want Americans to listen to my opinions could you just wait for a little bit?

And now for the specific accusations. First of all, special counsel Mueller has accused a certain private company in Russia that is not even a very big enterprise. The core area of competence is a restaurant. And now this company hired American lawyers and defending its integrity and reputation in American court.

So far, American court has not discovered any trace of interference whatsoever. Do you know it or not? Millions of Americans know about it.

And now do the individuals from the indictment act. We with the United States, we have a treaty for assistance in criminal cases, an existing treaty that exists from 1999. It is still in force and it works efficiently. Today I referred an example of its sufficient work.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: And I'm not trying to interrupt --

PUTIN: Why would Mr. Mueller --

WALLACE: I'm not trying to interrupt -- be disrespectful --

PUTIN: Well, let me finish. Just let me finish. You are trying to interrupt but I will finish. Why wouldn't special counsel Mueller send us an official request within the framework of this agreement? Our investigators will be acting in accordance with this treaty. They will question each individual that American partners are suspected of something.

Why not a singular request was filed? Nobody sent us a single formal letter.

WALLACE: Let me just say, I don't want to interrupt. And I want to ask one question -- I'm trying to move on to other subjects.

Why do you think Robert Mueller issued this indictment three days before you and President Trump met here at the summit?

PUTIN: I'm not interested in this issue a single bit. It's the internal political games of the United States. Don't make the relationship between Russia and the United States -- don't hold it hostage of this internal political struggle.

And it's quite clear to me that this is just an internal political struggle and it's nothing to be proud of for American democracy to use such dirty methods and political rivalry.

WALLACE: Do you think they were -- do you think that Mr. Mueller is trying to sabotage the relationship?

PUTIN: I don't want to make any assessments about his operation. It is for Congress that appointed him to do this, to assess his performance. And I think court actually had some doubts about the due procedure about appointing special counsel Mueller to the post that he now held.

I think that American court now believes that it was done stand with the infringement of the American legislation, but that's none of my business. Please address it to yourself.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Actually, Congress didn't appoint them. The Justice Department did.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: May I move on, sir? I thought the news conference today, my opinion was a bit curious because President Trump spent more time criticizing the Democrats and asking about the Democratic server than he did in criticizing Russia and asking about the GRU.

There are many theories in the United States about why President Trump is so reluctant to criticize you, and I would like to ask you about a couple of them. One is that you have something on him -- kompromat.

The other is that as a skilled politician and a former KGB officer, you know how to play him. You use phrases like fake news and deep state. And my question is, do you find President Trump easy to deal with?

PUTIN: Well, the first point I'm about to make is why did we talk about like polite people? Why should this come as a surprise? Was it worth going all the way to Helsinki, going through the Atlantic to just insult one another? It's not exactly the diplomatic standard in the world.

There's no need to go and meet personally if you just want to insult another person. We met to try to find a way for improving our relationship and not aggravating it or destroying it completely.

The second part of the answer is whether we have something on him. We don't have anything on them and there can't be anything on them. I don't want to insult President Trump when I say this, and I may come as rude. But before he announced that he would run for presidency, he was of no interest for us.

He was a rich person, but there is plenty rich persons in the United States. He was in the construction business. He organized the beauty pageants, but it never occurred to anyone that he would think of running for president. He never mentioned his political ambitions.

It sounds like it's an utter nonsense. I just mentioned this in the press conference. St. Petersburg Economic Forums was visited by 500 businessmen. Pretty much every one of them is a major industrialist tycoon on a greater scale than President Trump.

Do you think that our special services actually organize surveillance on each and every of them? Well unlike you and unlike like the United States, we don't do this. We don't have enough resources. We don't have enough manpower to organize the total state of control.

That's not part of our plan and it's clear that we did nothing of that kind against Mr. Trump.

WALLACE: I would like to ask you a couple of specific questions about NATO. If NATO were to move to add either Ukraine or Georgia to the alliance, how will you respond?

PUTIN: Well, negatively. The situation around NATO is going along those lines. I have a pretty clear understanding of how their decisions are made. I know about the consensus rule, but before the consensus-based decisions are made on the organization-wide basis, there is an opportunity for bilateral contacts with member states which was done with Poland, with Romania, which now station and deploy elements of the strategic anti- missile defense of the United States for us to want to direct an immediate threat for our national security.

So according to -- moving this NATO infrastructure towards our borders would be a threat and the reaction would be extremely negative.

WALLACE: Secondly, there are two major NATO exercises later this year -- Anaconda and Trident Juncture. Did you and President Trump discuss those? And did he give any indication, as he did with Chairman Kim of North Korea, where he agreed to stop participating in war games? Did he give any indication that the U.S. might not participate in these two NATO operations?

PUTIN: No. We haven't brought this issue up although it is a concern for us since NATO is expanding its infrastructure and facilities, the number of servicemen is on the rise in the regions where they shouldn't be. They increase the manpower to the tune of 10,000 people.

This is in compliance to the treaties between Russia and NATO and this is a destabilizing factor which we have to factor in, but we haven't mentioned this today with President Trump.

WALLACE: I want to ask you about Russia's involvement in Syria. According to independent monitors, since the civil war began in 2011, more than a half a million people have been killed and Russia has bombed civilians in Aleppo and Ghouta. No qualm about killing innocents?

PUTIN: You know, when there is warfare going on -- and this is the worst thing that can happen for the humankind, victims are inevitable. There will always be a question who's to blame.

I think it is the terrorist groups who are to blame, who destabilize the situation in the country -- the ISIS, the Jabhat al Nusra and the like. Those are the true culprits.

And that's exactly the answer that American military give us when they hit military -- civilians object in Afghanistan or other countries. And it might seem dubious to some people, but in fact it is true. In terms of Syria, America aviation bombed the city of Raqqa, bombed quite heavily, and today we discussed the need for humanitarian operations to be put in place, and I hope we'll make progress in this area. We would really like for the plans that we discussed today to be carried into life.

WALLACE: But the U.N. commission that is investigating Syria says, and I quote their words, there was deliberate targeting of civilians by Russian pilots flying SU 24 and 34 military aircraft.

PUTIN: All of it can be verified and assessed, but I just want to get back Raqqa.

WALLACE: You can't talk about Aleppo and Ghouta?

PUTIN: Well, we can discuss both, but should we also throw in Raqqa for good measure? We shouldn't take things out of the context and completely forget about others.

WALLACE: I don't think that there has been the bloodshed in Raqqa that there was, the hundreds of thousands of people that were killed in Aleppo and in Ghouta and in the entire civil war, half-a-million people. By some estimates, 20,000 children have been killed by the Assad regime and his supporters in Moscow. Are they terrorists?

PUTIN: You are completely deceived and I'm very sorry that you do not know the real situation about Syria. A huge proportion of civilian population of Raqqa died. It was erased from the face of the earth. It reminds Stalingrad from the World War II, and there is nothing good about it. And I reiterate, the blame is on those individuals who take guidance from those terrorists and use the civilian population as its hostages.

WALLACE: At the G-7 summit, President Trump reportedly told the other leaders that Crimea might as well be Russian because everybody there speaks Russian. Did he give you any indication that at some point, not today, but at some point he might recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea or lift sanctions, or move to bring Russia back into the G-7, now the G-8, all of which happened as a result of the annexation of Crimea?

PUTIN: First of all, I would like to make a correction. The joining of Crimea to Russia is not an annexation. In democratic governance, the free manifestation of a person's will is a referendum, and the people of Crimea went to referendum and voted for joining Russia. If this is an annexation what is democracy then?

Secondly, we are aware of President Trump's posture that Crimea is part of Ukraine. He told me this today. I responded with the words pretty much similar to what I said to you, and I think we should leave the discussion at that.

WALLACE: All right, we are running out of time anyway. Let's move on.

Last year, Defense Secretary Mattis said that Russia is the greatest threat, Russia is the greatest threat to the United States, and he has since made it clear, an even greater threat than terrorism. In March, you introduced a new generation of Russian missiles, including what you called in invincible missile you said that could evade, defeat all of our missile defenses, and you even released a video that showed the super missile flying over the United States and hitting Florida very near where President Trump's estate is at Mar-a-Lago. Aren't you escalating the arms race, and aren't you being deliberately provocative?

PUTIN: As far as the footage is concerned, they did not specify that the missile is about to hit the United States. You have to look at it more carefully. Secondly --

WALLACE: It shows Florida.

PUTIN: There was not sign Florida. There was not a caption saying Florida. Take a more careful look at it. It was never a caption Florida.

WALLACE: No, but you can see it on the map.

PUTIN: It was clear it was flying over the eastern coast of -- no, no, no it couldn't be seen on the map. Just take a closer look. And I'm not trying to scare your population with make believe threats. I'm pretty sure I can give you as a present this footage.

And now to the offensive weapons. They were not born out of nowhere. They were born as a response to the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the ABM treaty. From the very beginning we've been warning our American counterparts that we aren't going to join the global antimissile system, we see no purpose for it, but we'll do everything to have means to overcome it.

Well, the response of our counterparts was that the United States designed this antimissile defense system because it is not designed to be guided against you. In 2003 or 2004 I think I mentioned one of those systems, and there was no response from our American counterparts. So what we did now, we just demonstrated that we do have means to overcome the system. It's just a negotiating item. I do hope that in terms of strategic stability, we will be able to find a mutually acceptable solution for both sides, and that applies to the INF treaty under the intermediate and shorter range missiles as well.

WALLACE: I have limited time. I'd like to ask you about the alleged INF violation, but I want to move on and ask you three final questions about Vladimir Putin. When you were first elected in the year 2000, you were portrayed as a democratic reformer. You talked about the value of European culture, and you did not even rule out coming apart of NATO. What happened?

PUTIN: Nothing changed about me. I am the way I am. I am the way I was. I was elected the president of the Russian Federation as an adult man. And in this age, your preferences, beliefs and attitudes towards life does not change that much, but we have to react to what's going on around us.

Take the NATO expansion to the east. When the Soviet Union was withdrawing troops from Germany, Russians should know -- we were told that Russians should know one thing, that NATO would never extend beyond the German borders. Within two ways it happened. Despite our principal posture, nobody gave a damn about our posture.

We didn't want the United States to withdraw from the ABM treaty, but they did despite our request not to do it. All the requests were denied. And the examples abound. Take the events in Yugoslavia. You know that President Yeltsin was completely against this conflict, and the only legal way to use the force is through the sanction of the Security Council of the United Nations.

Examples abound, examples of events that deteriorated the status of our relationship. Or take the application of U.S. legislation extraterritorially beyond its borders. It was not us who made these steps. You asked me about Crimea, you asked me about Ukraine. It was not us who organized a military coup in the country that completely ignored the constitution. It was not us who given prize on the city squares. It is not the way to deal with such issues, and when it happened, it happened exactly by our border. So nothing happened to me. What happened to you is what I want to know? What happened to the west?

WALLACE: You say nothing happen to you, but I need to ask you, domestically, not internationally, domestically inside Russia, why is it that so many of the people that opposed Vladimir Putin end up dead or close to it? Former Russian spy and double agent Sergei Skripal, the victim of a nerve agent attack in England. Boris Nemtsov, a political opponent, gunned down near the Kremlin. Investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya murdered in an apartment building. Why is it that so many people who were political enemies of Vladimir Putin are attacked?

PUTIN: Well, first of all, all of us have plenty of political rivals. I'm pretty sure President Trump has plenty of political rivals.

WALLACE: But they don't end up dead.

PUTIN: Not always, well, haven't presidents been killed in the United States? Have you forgotten about it? Has Kennedy been killed in Russia or in the United States? Or Mr. King? And what happens with the clashes between police and civil society of several ethnic groups? That's something that happens on the U.S. soil. All of us have our own set of domestic problems.

But going back to what happened in Russia, yes, we do have crime, and, unfortunately, there are some crimes. And to some extent Russia's statehood is maturing. And there are some side effects, and we prosecute people responsible for these crimes. But since you have mentioned the Skripal case, we would like to get at least some sort of a document and evidence about it, but nobody gives it to us. It's the same thing as the accusations with meddling in the election process in America. We've recently heard that two more people suffered from the same nerve agent that is called Novichok. I have never even heard the last names of these persons. Who are they?

WALLACE: Supposedly they picked up the bottle that was used to attack Skripal. May I ask you one last question, sir?

PUTIN: No, no, let us seal this issue first. What kind of package, what kind of bottle, what is the chemical formula? Who got it? Or maybe there are other reasons, maybe reasons within the United Kingdom, but nobody wants to look into these. Now we just see the ungrounded accusations. Why is it done this way? Why our relationship should be made worse by this pretense? We have to build them with the U.K. as well.

WALLACE: Finally, I know one of the reasons he wanted to do this interview was so that people in the United States and the west could get a better understanding of the real man. You are often portrayed as a strong man, and autocrat, a person who is a symbol of Russia's strength. Are those fair characterizations of you, sir?

PUTIN: I'm not laying claim to be this kind of a strong man that I am being portrayed. But from the point of view of legal symbols, flag, all of them symbolize the country. And it's the same for any country. The anthem, the national flag, and the institute of the presidency, they portray Russian values and what it's ready to go for, what it's ready to stand for in order to build a relationship with such a great country as the United States.

I've mentioned economy before and I mentioned this fact to President Trump. Let's look at our market, for instance. Europeans sell hundreds of billions of dollars worth and about 1,500 billion Euro of services. The number for China stands at $57 billion. And what about the United States? It's $12 billion for the United States and $5 billion worth for services. So that's the direct result of these policies, including the sanctions.

In fact the United States have driven off their companies from the Russian market, so they left, and this vacuum was filled by their rivals, their competitors. Some of them lost their investments. What was that for? We are interested in developing our relationship in the area of security, of strategic stability, economic challenges, strategic challenges, and any other challenges that we have. I think that today with President Trump we made the first step in this direction.

WALLACE: Mr. President, thank you. Thank you for talking with us.

PUTIN: Thank you.

"An attack on U.S. troops in Afghanistan that killed one American was carried out by a member of the Afghan national police who is now in Afghan government custody, a U.S. official said Tuesday. It was the second so-called insider attack there this summer.

Lt. Col. Martin O'Donnell, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition in Kabul, said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the American was killed in eastern Afghanistan by an Afghan policeman. Another U.S. service member was wounded; O'Donnell said that person's wounds are not life-threatening.

On Tuesday evening the Pentagon said the soldier killed was Army Command Sgt. Maj. Timothy A. Bolyard, 42, of Thornton, West Virginia. It said he died of wounds sustained from small arms fire in Logar Province, but it provided no other details about the incident.

Bolyard was assigned to 3rd Squadron, 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade, based at Fort Benning, Georgia. His brigade was sent to Afghanistan early this year as part of a revamped American strategy to bolster the Afghan security forces by placing U.S. military advisers with Afghan troops closer to the front lines.

When the Monday attack was announced, the coalition termed it an apparent insider attack. The new U.S. commander of coalition forces, Army Gen. Scott Miller, called the death ""a tragic loss for all who knew and all who will now never know him.""

O'Donnell said in a telephone interview Tuesday that it now has been ""definitely"" determined that the attacker was an Afghan policeman. The shooter fled the scene but was apprehended by Afghans, he added.

Separately, the U.S.-led coalition in Kabul announced that a U.S. service member died in a ""non-combat incident"" Tuesday, also in eastern Afghanistan. That service member's name has not yet been released.

U.S. SERVICE MEMBER IN AFGHANISTAN DEAD IN APPARENT 'INSIDER ATTACK'

The threat of attacks on U.S. and coalition troops by Afghan soldiers and police is a persistent worry, although such violence is far less common than several years ago. There was an epidemic of attacks in 2012, with dozens of Americans killed and wounded in shootings almost weekly by the very troops the U.S. was fighting alongside. U.S. troops since 2014 have been mainly in an advisory and training roles, rather than combat.

The 2012 rash of killings led to the development of new procedures and precautions by coalition forces, including the use of ""guardian angels"" -- armed U.S. forces keeping watch whenever their fellow soldiers interact with Afghan forces. The reasons for such attacks are often not determined conclusively, but officials have said they sometimes reflect resentment by Afghans of the presence of foreign forces. U.S. troops have been in Afghanistan since 2001.

TALIBAN: FOUNDER OF HAQQANI NETWORK DEAD IN AFGHANISTAN

The previous insider attack this summer was against one such U.S. protective soldier, Cpl. Joseph Maciel of South Gate, California. He was killed and two other Americans were wounded in an attack July 7 by an Afghan security force member at an airfield on the military base at Tarin Kowt in southern Uruzgan province, a Taliban hotbed.",world
"Jeff Greene, a Florida gubernatorial candidate, accused the National Rifle Association of turning “our kids into targets” in a striking new advertisement.

“As a father, I won’t stand by while the NRA turns our kids into targets,” a mailer, released Tuesday, says in bold letters atop an image of outlined children with backpacks as shooting targets. The fake targets say “AR Practice” and have the logo of the gun rights organization.

“Students should be worried about grades, not guns,” Greene said in a statement. “When I send my kids to school, I shouldn’t be afraid they’ll be killed in their classrooms. No parent should.”

Gun violence, particularly school shootings, has been a major topic in this year’s elections in Florida.

In February, 17 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students and teachers were murdered by a gunman inside the school. And in June 2016, a gunman killed 49 people inside a gay Orlando nightclub.

A LOOK AT THE REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR IN FLORIDA

Greene’s mailer promises he will “never take [the NRA’s] blood money.”

Marion Hammer, a former NRA president who now leads the group's lobbying efforts in Florida, called the mailer “repulsive.”

“As a mother, grandmother and a proud NRA member for decades, I find his mailer repulsive,” she told Fox News. “It is clear that Jeff Greene is bankrupt of ideas, and he has to resort to these dumb ideas to try and get attention for himself and his campaign. When people can’t win on fact, they have to resort to cheap stunts like this.”

FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTION HEADQUARTERS

Aside from Greene, a billionaire investor who was a late entry to the race, four others are competing for the Democratic primary in August: Andrew Gillum, Gwen Graham, Chris King and Philip Levine.

"Ousted FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is seeking immunity in exchange for his testimony related to a Justice Department watchdog’s referral for possible prosecution, ahead of a congressional hearing on the handling of the Clinton email probe during the 2016 presidential election.

Michael Bromwich, an attorney representing McCabe, sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, on Tuesday requesting that McCabe be granted immunity in exchange for testimony surrounding the inspector general’s report that he leaked information and lied about it to former FBI director James Comey.

Bromwich told the senator, “McCabe welcomes your invitation to testify and is eager to answer any questions that you or other members of the Committee have,” adding that because of his “criminal referral” by the inspector general, he could face prosecution.

“We hereby request that the Judiciary Committee authorize a grant of use immunity to Mr. McCabe,” adding that the “no testimony or other information provided by Mr. McCabe could be used against him in any criminal case.”

McCabe was fired in March just a few days shy of his retirement by Attorney General Jeff Sessions after it was reported that he leaked a self-serving story to the press and later lied about it to Comey.

But Bromwich provided, in his letter to Grassley, information about emails that “demonstrate that Mr. McCabe advised former Director Comey, in October 2016, that Mr. McCabe was working with FBI colleagues to correct inaccuracies before certain media stories were published.”

McCabe was prevented from providing the emails themselves because of a non-disclosure agreement he was forced to sign by the FBI upon his termination and more information surrounding his account is unlikely to be revealed unless he is granted immunity, his lawyer said.

“If this Committee is unwilling or unable to obtain such an order, then Mr. McCabe will have no choice but to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination,” Bromwich added.

Comey has claimed that McCabe never informed him of the leak.

"A California woman’s refusal to sell her family home to a Trump supporter may have cost her more than $100,000.

In March the woman placed her Sacramento-area home on the market for $625,000 with one stipulation: The buyer must not be a Trump supporter. She later took the home off the market for reasons that were not clear.

But now the two-bedroom, two-bathroom home is being sold for less than $500,000, leaving some to wonder if the significantly lower price is at all related to the no-Trump-supporters demand, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The original ad, saying Trump backers need not apply, had some questioning its legality. The Fair Housing Act, prohibits race, religion, sex, and national original (among other classifications) from consideration in a transaction, but makes no mention of political affiliation. Yet one lawyer claimed the stipulation was a violation of a potential buyer’s First Amendment rights.

The woman was nevertheless adamant, telling CBS Sacramento: “When you’re talking about principles, morals, and ethics, it’s very, very deep.”

Now the home’s most current listing is under a different real estate agent and makes no mention of any special “restrictions,” the Sacramento Bee reported.

Ryan Lundquist, the real estate blogger who first mentioned the sale on Twitter on Thursday, suggested the reduced price had more to do with the original asking price being too high than with a reaction to the woman's demand.

“[I]t looks like it was priced like it was remodeled, when it really wasn’t,” Lundquist told the Bee, adding: “I’ve never met a buyer that said, ‘I’m only gonna buy if the seller voted for Bernie (Sanders).’ … People just don’t say that.”",politics
"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi faced questions last week about where she stands, or kneels, regarding the NFL's recently announced policy on national anthem protests.

Though she claimed to side with the players, her answers didn't sit well with many political observers.

""She punted,"" writes Becket Adams in the Washington Examiner, describing Pelosi's response to CNN's Chris Cuomo as a ""professional-strength nonanswer.""

Pelosi spoke with Cuomo as part of a ""town hall"" telecast Thursday. The host began by describing the policy recently announced by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.

NFL ADOPTS POLICY TO FINE TEAMS IF PLAYERS AND PERSONNEL DON'T STAND FOR NATIONAL ANTHEM

“When the anthem comes on, you stand,"" Cuomo said. ""If you do not want to stand, stay in the locker room. If you come out on to the field, you kneel or you in other ways protest, you will be fined.""

He then asked Pelosi: ""Are you OK with this rule change by the NFL?”

The California Democrat responded: “I would be more OK with it if they consulted with the players. I don’t think the players agreed to this. This is the owners. And by the way, it’s the owners who would be fined,” she said, to audience applause.

“I would be more OK with it if they consulted with the players. I don’t think the players agreed to this. This is the owners. And by the way, it’s the owners who would be fined.” - Nancy Pelosi, House minority leader

“I love the national anthem. … I’m from Baltimore. That’s where it was written, during the War of 1812. So I’m very possessive of it. Some people say maybe we should change the national anthem. No,” she said, to audience laughter.

She finished by saying she not only loves the flag, but also the First Amendment.

But to many on social media and other outlets, the reponse seemed wishy-washy at best.

“This is Democrats at their worst. Uhg. You either believe people have the right to voice their opinions or you don’t,” Hollywood producer Judd Apatow tweeted.

In a Washington Post essay, titled “Nancy Pelosi’s refusal to condemn NFL decision shows why Democrats struggle with black millennials,” Eugene Scott, who writes for the Fix, questions whether the Democratic Party has black voters’ ""best interests in mind.""

Scott writes that Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, told the Fix that rhetoric like Pelosi's explains why, in her view, most blacks in 2016 voted against President Donald Trump rather than for the Democratic Party.

“Democrats need to develop a message that incorporates the critical economic security issues along with a message that acknowledges the impact of the rise in racism in the country on younger voters and have actual solutions on how they plan to deal with that,” she said. “But any message that fails to incorporate those two things will land on deaf ears.”

Meanwhile, Jacob Weindling, writing for Paste Magazine, defends Pelosi’s response, arguing that the minority leader needs to be careful with her words, because they could be used against her.

“If Nancy Pelosi had said something like, ‘It was horrible of the NFL to violate their employees’ First Amendment rights, and we all need to understand this isn’t about protesting the military or the anthem,’ that reasonable clip would still appear in every GOP commercial across the country,"" Weindling writes.

He calls Pelosi's wavering on the issue “actually a very smart move.”

""They would play the edited video with sinister overtones, and say something to the effect of ‘[Congressional candidate] is a Nancy Pelosi liberal who wants to go to Washington to help make it easier to protest the men and women in uniform of this great country.’”

Overall, the Examiner's Adams writes, it seems the Democratic Party's leadership may simply have not yet decided “where to come down on the matter.”",politics
"In a bit more than a month since women in Saudi Arabia won the historic right to drive, a group of them is headed out on the road on not four wheels, but two.

“We have been waiting a lifetime for this,” said Aliya, an enthusiastic 23-year-old student from Jeddah who is set on motorcycling. “Always watching my brothers ride. Now they’re teaching me.”

Five young women swathed in their mandatory black abayas meander excitedly through the Harley-Davidson store in the country’s capital of Riyadh, examining the line of classic motorcycles and skimpy Harley branded t-shirts – a concept that would have been unthinkable less than a year ago.

It is a welcome sight for all the all-male staff at the prominent motorcycle store, who say they can’t wait to see women revving and rolling through the Riyadh streets.

“This is for sure going to be growing, we already have had a large number of ladies asking about the training and asking to get a bike,” said Marwan Al-Mutlaq, trading manager at the Harley-Davidson Saudi flagship. “And we have already established the ‘Ladies of Harley’ Riyadh chapter, so they can go on their own group rides too.”

The chapter opened with eight founding female members - but they anticipate that number will soon burgeon. In preparation, the store has acquired a selection of protective gear and female-specific clothes, along with marketing posters featuring women alongside men on motorcycles, resembling any such retail location one might see in the West.

“We have the basic gear for women - armored jackets, helmets, gloves, boots and accessories,” Al-Mutlaq added. “But we expect there will be a growing interest, and we will get a bigger range as more women learn to ride. The most important thing for now, is women learning to ride.”

Saudi women are slowly amassing those needed motorcycle skills through weekly gatherings at the Bikers Skills Institute. Set inside a racetrack on the periphery of the capital city center, and under the instruction of an experienced rider originally from the Ukraine, an all-female riding class convenes on Wednesday nights.

Dressed in their safety vests and form-fitting jeans, the women practice everything from gear shifts to quick stops, cone-weaving and U-turns, in a comprehensive program that costs around $400.

The ladies' motorcycle lessons started in February in the buildup for the new measure, and has attracted modest groups of eager females. Meanwhile, other women riders told Fox News they have already acquired their two-wheeling skills in the West, or in neighboring Arab countries like Bahrain, Dubai and Jordan.

“Most men are actually excited to see a woman driving here, and riding a motorcycle is the next step,” noted Harley’s male riding trainer, Mohammed, emphasizing they have an “assimilation” booth set up in-store where women are welcome to explore.

WHEELS OF CHANGE TURN QUICKLY FOR SAUDI WOMEN NOW PERMITTED TO DRIVE

SAUDI ARABIA EXPELS CANADIAN ENVOY AFTER CRITICISM OF ACTIVIST ARRESTS

The lifting of the female driving prohibition, announced in September last year and implemented on June 24, is part of a sweeping litany of reforms by the ambitious young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salam, designed to bring the genders closer to equality - and squash the nation’s undercurrent of religious extremism.

Some of the initial euphoria of the new-found freedom was eclipsed by a swell of arrests of women activists who had long lobbied to lift the draconian driving ban just prior to it coming into effect. And even though the Kingdom’s females are finally inching closer to finding their freedom behind the wheel – or the throttle – several roadblocks still stand in the way.

Women remain bound by guardianship laws requiring male permission to obtain a license. And the standard dress code of a long flowing abaya is both impractical and inherently dangerous for motorcycle riding.

But for now, the young men of Riyadh’s Harley store say it’s only a matter of time before all the kinks are ironed out.

“I will support women to ride in any way I can. I’m supporting my girl, she has already done the training and is constantly practicing and taking courses to get better,” Al-Mutlaq boasted of his 19-year-old girlfriend. “She wants an aggressive bike – she is planning on getting the Fat Boy.”",world
"The German capital is getting its infamous Berlin Wall back — at least for four weeks.

A group of artists said Tuesday they’re planning to build a facsimile of the wall around a downtown Berlin block in mid-October.

Visitors of the art installation must buy “visas” online starting at 15 euros ($17.50.) When entering the walled area, they’ll have to exchange their cellphones for a smartphone which will provide individual instructions for a tour including documentaries, exhibits or concerts.

The artists are not interested in creating a “Disney-style East Germany,” said Thomas Oberender of the Berliner Festspiele which organizes many performing arts events in the capital. Instead, the intention is more focused on creating an experience of traveling to a foreign country and losing the sense of freedom.

“Maybe it’s not going to be so exciting overall,” he said. “However, I think it will be.”

Visitors will not know in advance what kind of events will take place on the day they’re “in the city inside the city,” as the project has been dubbed. The smartphone they’re given may lead them to a fake conference of scientists or a meeting with a counselor. If they reject that offer, they will be suggested another event.

The artists’ group DAU, which is behind the project, says it wants to distribute between 1,500-3,000 “visas” per day.

Inside the walled block, there also will be viewing platforms from which visitors can peer outside into Berlin — in contrast to the Cold War platforms where people could peek into East Berlin from the West.

The district that will be walled in lies on the city’s downtown Unter den Linden boulevard and will include the famous State Opera, the Kurfuerstenpalais palace and other historical buildings. The artists, who envision special dispensations for people who work or live inside the zone, are still waiting for the final OK from the city’s authorities for their project.

The wall will be torn down on Nov. 9 — 29 years after the original Berlin Wall came down. The original wall was built by communist East Germany and divided the city from 1961 to 1989.",world
"Republicans on the House intelligence committee asked President Trump last month to declassify key sections of the surveillance warrant application for ex-campaign aide Carter Page, according to a letter obtained by Fox News.

The heavily-redacted application outlining the justifications for surveiling Page, which was approved and renewed several times by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), was released over the weekend after a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.

“Because DOJ (Department of Justice) and FBI continue to obstruct the Committee's investigation, it is time to put the facts in the public domain,” the letter, dated June 14, states.

The 13 Republicans on the committee, including committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., state in the letter that the declassification should be consistent “with the need to protect intelligence sources and methods,” adding that the declassification will “enable the public to understand the DOJ's and FBI's basis for obtaining the FISA warrant and three subsequent renewals.”

The Republicans highlight two sections of the document as key to understanding whether FBI and Department of Justice followed proper procedures when they obtained the authority to surveil Page on October 2016.

FBI TOLD FISA COURT SEVERAL TIMES THAT CLINTON-FUNDED SPY WASN'T SOURCE FOR MEDIA REPORT

A key part of the government's application to the FISC to surveil Page was an unverified dossier containing salacious allegations about President Trump. The dossier was opposition research paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign.

“... [W]e respectfully request that you declassify and release publicly, and in unredacted form, pages 10-12 and 17-34, along with all associated footnotes, of the third renewal of the FISA application on Mr. Page,"" the letter states. ""That renewal was filed in June 2017 and signed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.""

The letter states, that on its face, the bureau’s reliance on the dossier appears to violate strict, internal FBI rules.

“The Committee's investigative findings include DOJ's and FBI's use of an unverified dossier of memoranda that was not subjected to proper U.S. government verification and was not handled according to FBI procedures,"" the letter says.

It adds: “The FBI’s own Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide (known as the DIOG) prohibits the FBI from using unverified material to obtain a warrant under FISA. The unverified allegations in the dossier were nevertheless presented to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to obtain a FISA warrant and three renewals on Mr. Page. DOJ also presented a news article that was sourced from the author of the dossier.”

That is an apparent reference to a September 2016 Yahoo News article about intelligence officials probing Page as a possible Russian operative.

Based on the weekend document release, the Yahoo News article was presented to the surveillance court as an independent intelligence stream justifying the surveillance of Page.

FISA DOCUMENT RELEASE SHOWS FBI MAY HAVE USED 'CIRCULAR REPORTING' TO JUSTIFY SPYING ON TRUMP CAMP

But London court records show that contrary to the FBI's assessments that were presented to the FISC, ex-spy Christopher Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS -- the opposition research firm behind the dossier.

The lawmakers also advised the President they have requested the senior judge who oversees the FISA surveillance court “to conduct an investigation into DOJ's conduct in obtaining the FISA warrant and renewals.""

The Justice Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Fox News about the letter or whether the president is considering or has rejected the request. The FBI declined to comment.

Earlier this year, the House intelligence committee also called on Trump to declassify their FISA memo summarizing the warrant application for Page and subsequent renewals, which he did.

Democrats, who later released their own memo, called the declassification a danger to national security at the time, with the FBI issuing a rare public statement that the bureau had grave concerns about material omissions, they believed, impacted the memo’s accuracy.

Rosenstein also voiced reservations on the basis of endangering sources and methods.",politics

At least six people were killed, including two children, after a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle outside a district headquarters in Somalia's capital, authorities said Sunday.

Capt. Mohamed Hussein said the bomber tried to speed through a checkpoint but was stopped by security forces, prompting him to detonate the vehicle near the gate of Howlwadag district headquarters.

The three soldiers who stopped the truck were killed instantly and the three others killed were civilians, said the Mogadishu mayor's spokesman, Salah Hassan Omar.

Fourteen people, including six children, need intensive care, said the Aamin Ambulance service. Among the wounded was deputy district commissioner Ibrah Hassan Matan.

Many victims were students at a nearby Islamic school. Officials warned there could be more casualties as the blast brought down nearby buildings including a mosque.

""I saw bodies strewn on the ground after the explosion before the ambulances and the paramedics reached the scene and the whole scene was very ugly,"" witness Halima Mohamed said.

The attacker ""literally failed to achieve their goal of inflicting maximum casualties,"" police captain Hussein said, accusing the al-Qaida-linked extremist group al-Shabab of carrying out the attack.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion, which shattered a period of calm in seaside Mogadishu. The Somalia-based al-Shabab often targets the capital with bombings, including a truck bombing in October that left at least 512 people dead.

Somali troops are meant to take over the Horn of Africa nation's security in the coming years from an African Union force but concerns about their readiness remain high. The U.N. Security Council recently voted to delay the reduction of troops in the AU force from October to February and the target date to hand over security to Somali forces to December 2021.

"Cynthia Nixon has been frequently referenced in the press as trying to become New York’s first lesbian governor -- but the actress-turned-politician does not actually self-identify as a lesbian, instead considering herself as queer, according to campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt.

Speaking to the New York Daily News, Hitt noted that the frequent descriptions of Nixon as a lesbian were incorrect, but declined to discuss further why Nixon identifies as a queer rather than as a lesbian or as bisexual.

“It’s personal,” Hitt said of the choice.

Nixon, who rose to fame on HBO’s “Sex and the City,” and who is now challenging incumbent Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo ahead of the Sept. 13 Democratic primary, is married to LGBTQ advocate and political strategist Christine Marinoni. The couple has one child and Nixon also has two children with her ex-husband, Danny Mozes.

For decades, the term queer was used derisively to attack people who were not heterosexual, but in recent years the word has been ""reclaimed"" by many in the LGBTQ community. The term is now meant to include people who don’t necessarily feel they fall under any specific label and, in other cases, to highlight fluid gender identities.

""The term can represent a kind of freedom and acceptance which allows space for individuality and acknowledges that each person's sexuality and identity is distinct from every other,"" a pro-gay rights group, PFLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), says on its website.

Hitt told the New York Daily News that Nixon’s gender identity is not fluid, and the politician identifies solely as a woman.

LGBTQ rights are one of the benchmarks of Nixon’s gubernatorial campaign, as she has promised to push a pro-LGBTQ agenda in Albany if elected, including passing a law outlawing discrimination against those who are transgender.

While Nixon has won the support of some prominent groups within the community, Cuomo – who successfully pushed for legalizing same-sex marriage and signed an executive order that prohibits insurance companies from covering gay conversation therapy – also has the backing of many LGBTQ groups and leaders.

The Stonewall Democrats, the Empire State’s largest LGBTQ Democratic club, voiced its support for Cuomo in July.

“With the governor’s stances over the years [on gay marriage] and people from his staff have always asked questions, ‘How can we help, what can we do,’” club president Rod Townsend told the New York Post. “Our membership notices that.”

Nixon and Cuomo met last week for their only scheduled debate in a testy, hourlong exchange at Hofstra University that featured plenty of interruptions and insults. But neither candidate landed the political equivalent of a knockout blow likely to significantly alter the race.

Polls suggest Cuomo has a more than 30 percentage point lead over Nixon, who also trails substantially in fundraising.

The Democratic primary winner faces Republican Marc Molinaro, Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins and independent Stephanie Miner in November. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in New York by more than 2-1.

"Talks between the United States and Canada over the North American Free Trade Agreement broke up Friday without a deal, after a leak of off-record comments by President Trump roiled the high-wire negotiations.

Still, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement Friday that officials will continue to work with Canada’s foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, and others next week to strike a deal.

“The USTR team will meet with Minister Freeland and her colleagues Wednesday of next week,” Lighthizer said.

During a press availability Friday afternoon at the Canadian embassy in Washington, Freeland said, ""We have made good progress but there is still work to be done.""

Trump has been trying to negotiate a new NAFTA with both Mexico and Canada. The president announced Monday that he has secured a tentative deal with Mexico but said “we’ll see” if Canada can be part of the new agreement. The administration had set a deadline of Friday for a deal with Canada.

While the talks have not succeeded, the Trump administration on Friday sent a formal notification to Congress about its agreement with Mexico, saying Canada can join later if they reach a deal.

NAFTA TALKS ROCKED BY MEDIA LEAK OF OFF-RECORD TRUMP COMMENTS

“I have notified the Congress of my intention to enter into a trade agreement with Mexico -- and with Canada if it is willing, in a timely manner, to meet the high standards for free, fair, and reciprocal trade contained therein,” Trump said.

The talks were rocked Friday as The Toronto Star reported that it obtained comments from an off-the-record portion of an Oval Office interview between Trump and Bloomberg News. In those remarks, Trump said he isn’t making compromises with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, but isn’t going to say so publicly because “it’s going to be so insulting they’re not going to be able to make a deal.”

“Here’s the problem. If I say no, the answer’s no. If I say no, then you’re going to put that, and it’s going to be so insulting they’re not going to be able to make a deal ... I can’t kill these people,” he said of Trudeau’s government.

In another remark he did not want published, Trump said the deal would be “totally on our terms” and reportedly suggested he had tried to spook the Canadians with the threat of auto tariffs.

After the article was published, Trump slammed the media via Twitter for ""BLATANTLY"" violating the interview terms, while seeking to assure Canada.

""Wow, I made OFF THE RECORD COMMENTS to Bloomberg concerning Canada, and this powerful understanding was BLATANTLY VIOLATED. Oh well, just more dishonest reporting. I am used to it. At least Canada knows where I stand!"" he tweeted.

On the record, Trump had told Bloomberg that a deal was “close.""

""I think Canada’s going to make a deal at some point. It may be by Friday, or it may be within a period of time. But ultimately they have no choice,"" he said.

But then, according to The Star, he also reportedly said, “Off the record: totally on our terms. Totally.”

The comments have since made their way to Trudeau's government, causing problems for the talks.

The Star reported that they asked his administration about the remarks right before a critical meeting Friday. Further, the Star reported that Trudeau's team ""saw them as confirmation of its suspicions that Trump’s team has not been truly planning to compromise"" -- and raised the quotes to American negotiators at the beginning of Friday's meeting.

Asked for comment earlier Friday, the Canadian government referred to statements made by Trudeau, who said, ""We will only sign a deal if it is a good deal for Canada. Again, no deal is better than a bad deal for Canada and for Canadians and that’s exactly what we are remaining firm on.""

It's unclear how the Star even obtained the off-record comments. The article said they were obtained by a ""source,"" and Bloomberg's editor-in-chief did not dispute them.

A Bloomberg spokesman told Fox News: ""When we agree that something is off the record, we respect that.""

Daniel Dale, The Star reporter whose name was on the article, said that the Canadian side was “complaining to me about the Trump team showing no flexibility even before I asked them for comment this morning on the Trump quotes.”

“They see the quotes as confirmation of suspicions that the Trump team isn't working to make a win-win deal today,” he tweeted.

In August, Trump threatened Canada with auto tariffs if the U.S. and Canada can't forge a deal.

""Canada must wait,"" Trump tweeted. ""Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high. Will tax cars if we can't make a deal!""

Trump has been a critic of NAFTA for decades and during his presidential campaign described it as “the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere.”

"The White House said Wednesday that President Trump would consider whether to allow Russian prosecutors to interview onetime U.S. ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul and other Americans in connection with criminal claims against Bill Browder, a prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

On Wednesday, Sanders said there ""was some conversation"" between Trump and Putin at their Monday summit about Russia's request, ""but there wasn’t a commitment made on behalf of the United States and the president will work with his team and we’ll let you know if there’s an announcement on that front.""

""Work with his team to do what?"" McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia between 2012 and 2014, responded in an email to Fox News. ""The Trump administration needs to denounce categorically the moral equivalency between a legitimate indictment of Russian intelligence officers and a crazy, invented Russian conspiracy about American government officials assisting in an alleged money laundering scheme to help the [Hillary] Clinton campaign.""

When initially reached by phone, Browder told Fox News: ""I think the president doesn’t have jurisdiction over me because I’m a British citizen. He’d have to discuss that with [British Prime Minister] Theresa May and I don’t think she’d be too happy about turning me over to Putin.""

Hours later, Browder told Fox News' ""The Story"" that Sanders' statement was ""absolutely appalling and ridiculous.""

""The idea that the White House and Donald Trump would be considering handing these people over and me over to the Russians is just appalling,"" Browder told anchor Martha MacCallum. ""It's effectively treason to hand over patriotic people who’ve been trying to do the right thing, and they'd better come out quickly and walk that one back. Otherwise, this is truly a litmus test for the Trump administration.""

At a joint news conference in Helsinki, Finland, Putin offered to let Special Counsel Robert Mueller interview 12 Russian intelligence officials accused of hacking Democratic groups in 2016 if the U.S. would ""reciprocate."" The Russian leader suggested that Moscow's agents be allowed to question U.S. officers ""of interest"" to them ""so we can bring up Mr. Browder.""

Trump described Putin's proposal as ""an incredible offer"" during the news conference and told Fox News that Putin's idea was ""fascinating."" He later added that Mueller's prosecutors ""probably won't"" accept the offer, saying: ""The 13 angry Democrats? You think they’re going to want to go? I don’t think so.""

On Tuesday, news agencies linked to the Russian government reported that state prosecutors were seeking to interview McFaul and 10 other ""U.S. officials and intelligence agents"" in connection with their case against Browder. Russian prosecutors accused the financier of laundering $1.5 billion through offshore accounts and donating $400,000 of that sum to Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.

On Twitter, Browder said he had not donated any money to Clinton's campaign and called the prosecutor's claims ""total amateur hour."" Meanwhile, McFaul repeatedly called for the Trump administration to knock down the Russian request, which he described as ""outrageous"" and ""absolutely crazy.""

Browder has advocated for tougher sanctions against Putin's Russia on behalf of former business associate Sergei Magnitsky. Browder had hired Magnitsky to uncover details of a massive $230 million financial fraud in Russia involving corrupt Russian government officials. Magnitsky was imprisoned and died in Russian police custody in 2009. He was allegedly beaten to death.

At the State Department, spokesperson Heather Nauert described the allegations against Browder and the American officials as ""absolutely absurd.""

""We do not stand by those assertions that the Russian government makes,"" said Nauert, adding that ""the United States has rejected Russian allegations in this regard.""

""We continue to urge Russian authorities to work with the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue those in Russia who in fact perpetrated the fraudulent scheme that Russia refers to that targeted not only Mr. Browder and others, but also the Russian people as a whole.""

Browder told Fox News late Wednesday that Putin's account of the case against him ""is the same story that Natalia Veselnitskaya told in the Trump Tower meeting [with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort] in June of 2016.""

""This has been something that Putin has been sort of peddling through different mediums for a long time and it has now just reached the ears of the most powerful man in the free world, Donald Trump.""

"The State Department announced Wednesday that “a number of individuals” have been sent back to the United States from the American consulate in China after they suffered illnesses similar to those experienced by government personnel in Cuba.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said that a medical team was sent to Guangzhou, China, after the U.S. learned that one government employee “suffered a medical incident that was consistent with what American personnel in Havana, Cuba had experienced.”

She continued, “The medical screenings are ongoing for any personnel who have noted concerning symptoms or wanted baseline screening.”

US EMBASSY WORKERS IN CUBA FOUND TO HAVE BRAIN ABNORMALITIES, REPORT SAYS

In October, at least 24 Americans at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba complained of illnesses that the State Department called “health attacks.”

They reported hearing loud, grating noises before experiencing hearing loss, dizziness, headache, fatigue, cognitive issues and difficulty sleeping, officials said.

Cuba has maintained that it had no involvement in or knowledge of any such attacks.

The U.S. announced in March that it would be withdrawing 60 percent of its diplomats from Cuba permanently, citing the need to protect American personnel from the unexplained health attacks.

It remains unclear if there is a link between the illnesses experienced in both diplomatic offices.

"Protesters demanded Northern Ireland's feuding political parties get back to governing, as the region matched a world record Tuesday for the longest peacetime period without a government.

It has been 589 days since the Catholic-Protestant power-sharing administration collapsed in January 2017 over a botched green-energy project. The rift soon widened to broader cultural and political issues separating Northern Ireland's British unionists and Irish nationalists, and attempts to restore the government have stalled.

Belgium spent 589 days without an elected government between 2010 and 2011.

Protesters used the hashtag #wedeservebetter to call for the former governing parties, the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein, to restore the power-sharing government. Demonstrators planned to hold demonstrations in several cities on Tuesday evening.

Civil servants have run the government in Northern Ireland since the administration collapsed, with major spending and policy decisions deferred. The British government stepped in to approve Northern Ireland's budget, but has resisted pressure to take direct control from London.

The political crisis has left 1.8 million people without a government and threatens power-sharing, the key achievement of the 1998 peace accord that ended decades of violence and bloodshed in Northern Ireland.

The British government agreed there was an ""urgent need to resolve the current impasse."" It said Tuesday its priority was ""to secure a basis for political talks and re-establish a locally elected, democratically accountable devolved government at the earliest opportunity.""

But there was little sign of reconciliation from Northern Ireland's politicians. Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster said it was ""long past the time to get back into government,"" but claimed Sinn Fein was the problem.

The DUP marked Tuesday's milestone by unfurling a banner outside the Stormont government building calling on Sinn Fein to end its ""boycott"" of government.

Sinn Fein says the DUP is prolonging the stalemate by refusing to back legal protection for the Irish language and by blocking same-sex marriage, which is legal everywhere in the U.K. apart from Northern Ireland.

""Those rights issues will continue to have to be addressed, they are still here, they are still part of the reason why this institution collapsed. They are going to have to be addressed,"" said Sinn Fein politician Conor Murphy.",world
"An Aeromexico jet crashed after takeoff in the northern state of Durango, Mexico, on Tuesday.

No one was killed in the accident and all 103 people aboard Flight 2431 were found, Gov. José R. Aispuro said.

The governor added that 49 people had been hospitalized, noting that some passengers got out on their own, while other wandered back to the nearby airport.

""The most seriously injured is the pilot,"" Israel Solano Mejia, director of the Durango state civil defense office, told Foro TV. ""The majority of passengers left (the plane) under their own power.""

Aeromexico initially said 97 passengers and four crew members were aboard the plane, but the governor said there were actually 103 people on the plane and that two minors had not been included in the first tally.

The incident involved Flight 2431 aboard the Embraer 190 aircraft. Mejia said the plane ""made it off the ground, but fell nose-first.""

Aispuro said Tuesday that the airliner was hit by a wind gust as it left the runway just before it crashed.

According to FlightAware, the Aeromexico flight took off on time at 3:08 p.m. local time. It was headed to Mexico City, where it was scheduled to land at 4:38 p.m.

Officials and witnesses differ on whether the plane either fell shortly after takeover or ran off the runway without really gaining altitude. But they agree the plane was trying to take off during a storm.

Each of the pups has been named for a character from ""Gilligan's Island,"" the popular 1960s comedy series about a group of castaways stranded on an island, the CBC reported.

"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent out a dramatic, no-holds-barred fundraising email on Monday saying she is ""determined to avenge President Obama if it’s the last thing I do"" by preemptively opposing President Trump's Supreme Court nominee.

Pelosi, 78, is one of several top Democrats -- including Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.-- who already have announced that they oppose Trump's pick without knowing whom the president has selected. Schumer has said the Senate should not consider any Supreme Court nominees during an election year.

Meanwhile, Fox News has learned that several red-state Democrats, including three who voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch last year, will not be attending tonight's primetime rollout of the Supreme Court nominee in the White House.

In the fundraising email, Pelosi opened by acknowledging that she has been making persistent appeals to potential donors lately: ""I emailed on Saturday. I emailed on Sunday. Now I’m emailing you again today.""

She then outlines her plan to get back at Senate Republicans for their refusal to vote on Obama's 2016 Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. That vacant seat ultimately went to now-Justice Gorsuch after Trump's election. Pelosi, though, has no actual vote in the confirmation process, and seemingly uses the email to raise money for House Democratic candidates.

""I just learned that SECONDS after Trump’s announcement... Republicans will launch an unprecedented $1.4 MILLION ad blitz to support his nominee,"" Pelosi wrote. ""I’m worried this will eviscerate our chance to make Republicans pay for the Supreme Court seat they STOLE from President Obama.""

The email, with the subject line ""Trump nominee BACKFIRES,"" was sent by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and signed by Pelosi.

It goes on to promise that Pelosi will ""personally triple-match"" any gifts to her so-called ""Supreme Court fund"" prior to Trump's announcement.

""I’m determined to avenge President Obama if it’s the last thing I do."" - Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

TOP DEM SUGGESTS SACRIFICING SENATE SEATS TO STOP TRUMP NOMINEE

Pelosi's link to the Supreme Court fund takes prospective donors to a website apparently run by the DCCC. In large text, the website reads: ""Democrats 2018.""

Pelosi's heightened rhetoric was matched by other Democrats in the tense run-up to Trump's expected Monday night primetime announcement of his replacement for retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy.

The White House hit back earlier in the day after another top Democrat vowed to oppose Trump's judicial nominee sight-unseen.

In a series of tweets, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., called the nomination process ""corrupt.""

""I will oppose the nomination the President will make tonight because it represents a corrupt bargain with the far Right, big corporations, and Washington special interests,"" Casey tweeted. ""Any judge on this list is fruit of a corrupt process straight from the D.C. swamp.""

Casey, ostensibly a pro-life Democrat, has been supported by abortion rights groups because of his votes for Planned Parenthood and Obamacare. He has a 100-percent rating from pro-choice group NARAL.

DID ORRIN HATCH JUST DROP MAJOR CLUE ABOUT TRUMP'S SCOTUS PICK?

In response, White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah called Casey's decision predictable but regrettable.

""Unfortunate (though not surprising) that even before his or her qualifications can be evaluated, Sen. Casey is refusing to even consider the President’s #SCOTUS nominee,"" Shah wrote.

Shah also announced that former Arizona GOP Sen. John Kyl would be the so-called ""sherpa"" for Trump's nominee, meaning that he will help guide the nominee through Senate meetings and other trappings of the process.

Pennsylvania, which Casey represents, narrowly went for Trump in 2016. But Casey's seat is relatively secure -- unlike the seats of other red-state Democrats, such as West Virginia's Joe Manchin, North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp and Indiana's Joe Donnelly.

Manchin, Heitkamp, and Donnelly each were invited to the White House tonight for Trump's Supreme Court announcement, Fox News has confirmed. All three, who voted for Gorsuch's confirmation last year, declined the invitation.

""While I appreciate the invitation from the White House to attend this evening’s announcement, I declined so that I can meet first with the nominee in a setting where we can discuss his or her experience and perspectives,"" Donnelly said in a statement. ""In the coming days, I will be reviewing the record and qualifications of the president’s nominee.""

Additionally, Fox News has learned that another red-state Democrat, Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, will not attend the rollout tonight. Jones -- potentially a key vote in the upcoming nomination -- was not a senator during the Gorsuch hearings.

California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, also will not attend despite being invited, Fox News can confirm.

The embattled red-state senators likely must choose between alienating their constituents or trying to halt a conservative nominee who may ultimately prove unstoppable anyway because of the GOP's slim Senate majority.

Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham called the Supreme Court nomination a veritable ""nightmare"" for Democrats hanging onto their vulnerable seats in states that largely support Trump.

But over the weekend, a top Democratic senator suggested that stopping the nominee is more important than the upcoming midterm elections.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., acknowledged that so-called red-state Democrats may be tempted to vote for Trump's selection out of political necessity, but urged his colleagues Sunday to consider more than their political careers.

""Beyond the procedure, beyond the gamesmanship, it is a life-and-death important decision to be made by this court on so many issues,"" the Senate minority whip said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

"One of President Trump’s biggest campaign promises was his vow to build a wall along the country’s southernmost border.

Congress has yet to fund the wall, and Trump’s demands that Mexico pay for it have gone nowhere. However, the president has seemingly evolved on what he’s called the “big, beautiful wall,” as he has contended a physical structure might not be needed “where you have rivers and mountains and everything else protecting” the border.

Read on for a closer look at Trump’s proposed border wall by the numbers.

2015

Trump first proposed the border wall when he announced his presidential candidacy in June 2015. It was then that he made the controversial remarks about the people emigrating from Mexico.

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” Trump said on June 16, 2015. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems … They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.”

“I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me,” Trump said. “I’ll build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I’ll have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.”

1,954

The continental border between the U.S. and Mexico stretches for nearly 2,000 miles. The land border reaches across four states: Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas.

The entire border extends from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean.

18 billion

Trump unveiled his budget plan in February 2018 and included in it a $23 billion request for border security. Of that, $18 billion would be designated to building the border wall.

170,000

A Department of Homeland Security report estimated that 170,000 people successfully entered the U.S. illegally from the southern border in 2015. That number is significantly less than the 1.7 million people estimated to have entered in 2005.

5.6 million

There were approximately 5.6 million ""unauthorized immigrants"" from Mexico by 2016, according to data from the Pew Research Center. That number has decreased from 6.4 million in 2009.

4

Four companies were selected to build concrete prototypes of the border wall, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced in August 2017.

Those companies are: the Caddell Construction Company of Montgomery, Ala.; Fisher Sand and Gravel of Tempe, Ariz.; Texas Sterling Construction Company of Houston, Texas; and WG Yates and Sons Construction of Philadelphia, Miss.

The prototypes will be 30 feet tall and 30 feet wide and will cost up to $500,000 to make.

101

U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel ruled against an environmental challenge to the border wall on Feb. 27. In a 101-page ruling, Curiel wrote that Congress and the executive branch “share responsibilities in protecting the country from terrorists and contraband illegally entering at the borders.”

Curiel’s ruling allows the administration to issue waivers on environmental laws and begin to build sections of the border wall.

However, in a tweet, Trump said he will not approve sections of the wall in California to be built “until the whole Wall is approved.”

8

Trump visited California on March 13 to survey eight towering prototypes for the wall, among other things.

He said he prefers a concrete wall because it was the hardest to climb, but also said he wants it to be see-through.

""We have a lousy wall over here now, but at least it stops 90, 95 percent,"" Trump said. ""When we put up the real wall, we're going to stop 99 percent. Maybe more than that.""

"From protecting access to abortion in the U.S., to his relationship with a beleaguered judge accused of sexual misconduct, Brett Kavanaugh can expect a grueling confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week.

Kavanaugh, President Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court, will be questioned about his views on a bevy of legal issues, including executive power, reproductive rights, gun violence and privacy.

The White House assembled a team of attorneys from the counsel’s office, Kavanaugh’s roster of former clerks and other Republican lawyers to document his record and meticulously help the 53-year-old prepare for questions expected from senators.

Read on for a look at five topics senators could bring up during the confirmation hearing that begins on Sept. 4.

Abortion rights

Although he has not expressed outright opposition to abortion, liberals and women’s rights groups have already warned of the end of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, should Kavanaugh be confirmed. Trump has said he has not spoken with Kavanaugh about abortion.

At a rally in front of the Supreme Court in August, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said senators need “to stand up and vote ‘no’ against this judge [because] he is going to harm this country and he is going to harm women.”

In 2017, Kavanaugh issued a dissent in a case involving an undocumented immigrant who wished to be released from custody in order to have an abortion. While the court eventually allowed her to have the procedure, Kavanaugh said the majority opinion was “radically inconsistent with 40 years of Supreme Court precedent.”

KAVANAUGH'S STAUNCH GUN-RIGHTS DEFENSE AMONG HUNDREDS OF DECISIONS IN SPOTLIGHT

He argued if the government helped the 17-year-old obtain an abortion, then it ignores its ""permissible interest in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor and refraining from facilitating abortion.”

Rochelle Garza, an immigration attorney who represented the teenager, is expected to testify on behalf of Senate Democrats during Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing.

Presidential authority

Kavanaugh worked with Kenneth Starr in the 1990s, co-writing the independent counsel’s report laying out the legal framework supporting then-President Bill Clinton’s impeachment. He said Clinton should be impeached because he misled the public and lied to his staff, according to The New York Times.

But in 2009, citing his role with the investigation into Clinton, Kavanaugh expressed his opinion that presidents should not have to deal with criminal investigations or civil lawsuits while in office.

Writing for the Minnesota Law Review, Kavanaugh said, “I think we grossly underestimate how difficult the job [of U.S. president] is.” Because of that, he said he believes “[it's] vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible.”

TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT PICK NEEDS SENATE APPROVAL: A LOOK AT THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS

Ahead of his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh submitted a completed 110-page questionnaire in which he said neither Trump nor anyone else associated with him approached him about “any currently pending or specific case, legal issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any express or implied assurances concerning your position on such case, issue or question” before he was asked to be the nominee, Politico reported.

Relationship with Kozinski

Once upon a time, Kavanaugh was able to turn to Judge Alex Kozinski, of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, for advice. But Kozinski has since retired from the court after he was accused by several female former law clerks and colleagues of sexual misconduct, including inappropriate comments, touching and forced viewings of pornography.

Kozinski said in a statement through an attorney many of the allegations weren't true, though deeply regretted his ""unusual sense of humor caused offense or made anyone uncomfortable.""

""I have always tried to treat my male and female clerks the same,"" he said.

While no evidence thus far has surfaced that would suggest Kavanaugh had any knowledge of Kozinski’s alleged wrongdoings, Kavanaugh is sure to be asked about his relationship to the former judge.

KAVANAUGH SUPREME COURT HEARING WITNESSES INCLUDE FORMER LAW CLERKS, SCHOOL SHOOTING SURVIVOR: A FULL LIST

“Alex Kozinski’s relationship with Judge Kavanaugh is a legitimate area of inquiry, and I plan to question Judge Kavanaugh on this topic,” Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, told The Associated Press.

White House spokeswoman Kerri Kupec has said Kavanaugh “had never heard any allegations of sexual misconduct or sexual harassment by Judge Kozinski” prior to media reports.

Privacy rights

Kavanaugh has often supported giving the U.S. government wide berth in the name of national security – including when it comes to the secret collection of personal data from Americans. This support is expected to be a topic of consternation among Democrats ready to grill the judge.

Sens. Dick Durbin and Pat Leahy are among Democrats who want to see more records from Kavanaugh's White House days. Durbin, in particular, has said Kavanaugh “acknowledged that he was involved in conversations involving enemy combatants” during a private meeting with the senator.

But Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio maintained that Kavanaugh is “incredibly well-qualified.”

JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY ON THE SUPREME COURT: HIS LEGACY AND THE FUTURE OF HIS SEAT

“I think he’s in the mainstream with regard to these issues, and frankly, I don’t think it’s a difference with any meaning between where he is and where the court is currently,” Portman said.

And Kavanaugh has already earned the support of libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul. The Kentucky Republican said, after meeting with Kavanaugh, he will “carefully adhere to the Constitution and will take his job to protect individual liberty seriously.”

Gun control

Kavanaugh’s position on gun control is expected to come under scrutiny during his confirmation hearings – particularly as a Parkland school shooting survivor is slated to testify on behalf of Senate Democrats.

Among one of Kavanaugh’s decisions in the spotlight is a 2001 dissenting opinion he authored on a pivotal gun ban.

In Heller v. District of Columbia, the D.C. Circuit Court upheld the District’s ordinance banning most semi-automatic rifles. But in that case, Kavanaugh wrote the dissenting opinion, arguing the Supreme Court had already decided handguns – “the vast majority of which today are semi-automatic” – are constitutionally protected under the Second Amendment.

He said despite gun violence in the area, “our task is to apply the Constitution and the precedents of the Supreme Court, regardless of whether the result is one we agree with as a matter of first principles or policy.”

The Supreme Court eventually took the case and struck down the ordinance; it held that the Second Amendment protects the possession of semi-automatic weapons for purposes unrelated to militia use.

The National Rifle Association has applauded Kavanaugh’s nomination to the bench.

"Hillary Clinton, in an interview with a British newspaper this week, appeared to compare herself to wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill while responding to a question about being a polarizing figure.

“I’m sure they said that about Churchill between the wars, didn’t they?” she told The Guardian when asked if she should withdraw from public life to help heal divisions in the U.S., given her reputation.

The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee then immediately claimed she wasn't actually comparing herself to Churchill, before going on to elaborate on the analogy.

Churchill went into the political wilderness between the two World Wars and during that time was a key voice criticizing then-Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement toward Adolf Hitler. He would go on to become prime minister himself and help lead the Allies to victory in World War II.



The Guardian report notes that Clinton made the Churchill reference “a fraction too quickly for the line to sound spontaneous.”



Clinton continued: “I mean, I’m not comparing myself, but I’m just saying people said that, but he was right about Hitler, and a lot of people in England were wrong. And Churchill was a pain. He kept popping up all the time.”

Clinton indeed has remained a polarizing figure, with her popularity falling since the election, as she has stayed in the public eye with her book tour and media interviews.

She told the Guardian she is not going to “call it a day” anytime soon.



“It feels like a duty. It feels like patriotism, and it feels necessary. I’m not going anywhere,” she said.

Clinton also used the Guardian interview to comment on the separation of families at the border in the wake of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance policy” that ordered that all illegal border crossers be prosecuted. Trump has ordered the separations to be stopped, but critics are still fighting the prosecutions and other detentions.



Clinton said that she is worried that some of the minors may never be reunited, saying that that question is “keeping me up at night.”



“Absolutely I worry about that. I’m worried that some children will not be reunited,” she said.",politics
"Former Arizona senator Jon Kyl was tapped to replace Sen. John McCain, who recently lost his battle to an aggressive form of brain cancer.

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey announced the news Tuesday, writing on Twitter that he is “deeply grateful to Senator Kyl for agreeing to succeed his friend and colleague of so many years.”

Kyl will serve as a placeholder and is not expected to run in 2020 — the year voters will decide who will fill McCain’s seat for the following two years. After that, the seat will be open for a full six-year term.

McCain's widow, Cindy, tweeted: ""Jon Kyl is a dear friend of mine and John's. It's a great tribute to John that he is prepared to go back into public service to help the state of Arizona.""

ARIZONA PRIMARIES FOCUS ON EDUCATION, IMMIGRATION: RACES TO WATCH

Kyl was a longtime Republican senator in Arizona, serving from 1995 to 2012 before retiring from Congress in 2013. He left as the second highest-ranking Republican senator.

Kyl, a longtime friend and colleague of McCain, wrote in The Weekly Standard following McCain’s death that the former Vietnam war hero “faced his inevitable end with courage and grace.”

In light of the news, here are three things to know about Kyl.

He’s a practicing attorney

After retiring from Congress in 2013, Kyl, 76, joined the law firm Covington & Burling as part of its “expansion of its public policy and government affairs practice,” Politico reported that same year.

According to his biography on the firm’s website, Kyl “advises companies on domestic and international policies that influence U.S. and multinational businesses and assists corporate clients on tax, health care, defense, national security and intellectual property matters among others.”

The same year he joined the firm, he told Politico he received “several offers” but “had [his] eye on Covington from day one.”

""I think McCain would be very happy with the pick. Honors his legacy while putting some major horsepower for Arizona in the seat, at least for now."" - Doug Cole, long-time Republican consultant and former McCain aide

“I had a serious law practice, and with the experience I gained in Congress, I think I have acquired the knowledge and judgment to help clients that reflects my legal training and experience in Congress,” he told the publication.

Rather recently, in March, Kyl was one of the leading attorneys from the firm who helped scrap Broadcom Limited’s hostile takeover of Qualcomm, Inc. The firm secured the deal after Trump blocked the proposed acquisition, citing national security reasons, the firm said in a statement.

Republicans are hopeful that he’ll vote along party lines

Unlike McCain — who opposed a partial repeal of former President Obama’s health care law before he died, for example — Republicans are hopeful Kyl will be a “reliable partisan vote,” The Associated Press reported.

""I think McCain would be very happy with the pick. Honors his legacy while putting some major horsepower for Arizona in the seat, at least for now,"" Doug Cole, a longtime Republican consultant and former McCain aide, told The Associated Press.

He’s serving as Brett Kavanaugh’s “sherpa”

In July, the former senator agreed to serve as President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s “sherpa” during his confirmation process.

As “sherpa,” or escort, Kyl “will be tasked with shepherding Trump’s pick through the Senate, much in the same way former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte helped to pave a path for Justice Neil Gorsuch last year,” The National Law Journal previously reported.

This isn’t the first time Kyl has served in this role. The National Law Journal also reported the former senator, who has a “deep knowledge of the Senate Judiciary Committee,” previously served on the committee during “four of the last five Supreme Court justices’ confirmation hearings.”

In fact, The Arizona Republic reported Kyl also served as Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ sherpa ahead of his confirmation hearing.

"A federal judge in Florida this week ordered Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that commissioned the infamous anti-Trump dossier, to give a deposition in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against BuzzFeed News and the former British spy who compiled the dossier.

In a 16-page ruling filed Thursday, U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro rejected claims by Fusion that sitting for a deposition would ""require disclosure of confidential business relationships"" and ""implicate Fusion GPS' First Amendment rights."" Ungaro also wrote that Fusion must answer questions about what ex-MI6 spy Christopher Steele was told about the nature of his assignment to compile the dossier.

""There is no evidence in the record to suggest that such inquiry would be cumulative and Fusion GPS's conclusory claims of undue burden are plainly outweighed by the significant relevance of the proposed inquiry,"" Ungaro wrote.

Russian tech guru Aleksej Gubarev has filed civil claims in the U.S. and the U.K. against BuzzFeed and Steele. He claims his companies, Webzilla and XBT Holdings, were defamed by Steele after the BuzzFeed published the dossier on Jan. 10, 2017.

The dossier alleged that Gubarev's companies ""used botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct 'alerting operations' against the Democratic party leadership.""

The dossier drew worldwide headlines for its salacious, unverified allegations about then-President-elect Donald Trump. Though Gubarev's lawsuit does not directly involve Trump, it promises a harsh spotlight on the vetting processes of both Steele and BuzzFeed.

Gubarev's attorney, Evan Fray-Witzer, told Fox News in an email that Fusion GPS will have until Aug. 31 to sit for a deposition.

""After a year of doing everything they could think of to avoid being deposed, Fusion GPS will finally have to answer our questions,"" Fray-Witzer told Fox News. ""We knew that they had made a mistake when they asked for the case to be sent down to Florida. Judge Ungaro is very engaged in this case and she saw through Fusion’s objections.""

Josh Levy, an attorney for Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.

Last month, Steele gave a four-hour videotaped deposition in London in order to comply with a similar order by a British High Court judge.

Steele and his company, Orbis Business Intelligence, were hired by Simpson's U.S.-based Fusion to work on the dossier and promote its contents to journalists. Fusion received $1.8 million via the law firm Perkins Coie, which was paid by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.",politics
"U.S. military equipment and ammunition, sent to Syria as part of a failed Obama administration plan to find and arm moderate forces to defeat ISIS, were instead simply handed over to an Al Qaeda group, according to the man who said he himself brokered the deal.

“I communicated with Al Qaeda’s branch, Al Nusra, to protect and safely escort me and my soldiers for two hours from North Aleppo to West Aleppo,” Maj. Anas Ibrahim Obaid, better known on the battlefield as Abu Zayd, told Fox News from his home in the western Aleppo area. “In exchange, I gave them five pickup trucks and ammunition.”

Those trucks and ammo were issued to him by the United States in 2015, part of a $500 million Department of Defense effort to ""train and equip"" a new ""ideologically moderate"" force to battle ISIS. The program, one of at least two designed to funnel arms to so-called moderate Syrian rebels, proved to be a spectacular failure for the Obama administration.

Zayd, who said he defected from the Syrian Army to the opposition in 2012, described a program that was rife with inconsistencies and incompetencies.

He claimed the main prerequisite for inclusion in the program was proof of association with a group that had fought ISIS, the Islamic State. That was followed by a few basic questions, like, ""With which faction did you fight?"" and ""What do you think about ISIS?""

After undergoing training in Turkey, the first batch of 54 trained fighters crossed back to Syria in July 2015 – only to be almost instantly ambushed by Al Nusra militants. Several of the men were kidnapped, and their U.S.-issued weapons were stolen.

Zayd said he was part of a second group to be sent into Syria -- this time without proper firepower.

The U.S. trainers ""wanted us to go into Syria without weapons because of the ambush, and said we could get the weapons inside instead. This was crazy,” Zayd recalled. “We refused.”

The weapons issue was worked out, and the rebels eventually started their journey back to Syria on Sept. 19. But Turkish border guards found something else in their bags: Syrian regime flags, rather than the flags of the opposition group the fighters were being sent to support.

Zayd said fighters charged back to their base in Turkey, demanding answers. U.S trainers took responsibility for the “flag mistake,” Zayd said, and the following day the rebels continued back to Syria.

But morale was already a problem, Zayd said, and fighters who were being paid a $250 monthly salary by the Defense Department began defecting. His group of 72 shrank to just 25, he said.

Zayd said he, too, became quickly fed up with the program and planned to return to his hometown in western Aleppo to fight the Syrian regime.

But getting home entailed moving through Al Nusra territory. That's when he called the Al Qaeda-affiliated leaders and made the arrangement to hand over the five U.S-issued trucks and scores of ammunition, in exchange for free passage and an armed escort home.

“The Americans were so angry when they found out, they cut my salary,” Zayd said nonchalantly. “But this was our only option through their territory to get home without getting killed.”

Zayd said the Pentagon halted the troubled program about a month after his deal with Al Nusra. “I got many messages the Americans do not want to deal with me anymore. But they can’t get their weapons back,” he boasted.

Over Skype from his living room, Zayd showed off an assortment of M-16 and M-24 sniper rifles, as well as ammo, mortar rounds and machine guns. He claimed most in his arsenal were U.S.-issued, with more in a nearby warehouse.

Sources close to Zayd told Fox News his American-funded goods routinely surface on the black market, and constitute something of a lucrative business. Zayd today remains a commander for the Free Syrian Army.

A second Obama administration program, ""Timber Sycamore,"" was started by the CIA in late 2012 with the similar aim of arming rebels. This particular operation was active along the Turkish border to Syria's north, and a Jordanian crossing in the south, referred to as the “Southern Front.”

But Syrian opposition figures say this program was also compromised, with arms falling into the hands of ISIS or Al Nusra.

The program initially supplied light weapons. But as the Syrian civil war intensified, the U.S. strengthened its commitment by providing selected rebels with American “tune-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided” antitank missiles, better known as BGM-71 TOWs.

One opposition group backed by Washington in 2014 to use the TOWs was the FSA group Hazem Movement.

“We became optimistic we could overthrow the regime,” Asem Zidan, 27, formerly a media activist for the FSA’s Hazem, told Fox News. “And the TOW missiles helped us to prevent the regime pushing forward for some time ... but it wasn’t enough.”

Zidan said only 10 TOWs at a time were issued, which he said fell well short of what was required to defeat regime forces. And matters only worsened when Al Nusra started to attack and “steal their weapons.”

Another rebel fighter, Suheil Alhamoud, 30, who defected from the Syrian Army in March 2012 -- where he was a specialist in missiles – also expressed frustration over what he called insufficient efforts to help.

After a string of several successful attacks against ISIS forces, Alhamoud said that in late November 2014 he received a supply of malfunctioning TOWs, believed to have come from surplus Saudi stockpiles. But despite having a stated range of more than two miles, some missiles would travel no more than 150 feet.

“I suffered a lot because of that,” Alhamoud contended. “And so the regime and the terrorists advanced. We were told more TOWs would come, but it took weeks for them to arrive.”

Alhamoud also conceded that Al Nusra managed to steal a number of TOWs, many of which have since landed on the black market, fetching up to $30,000 apiece.

Ibrahim al-Jabawi, who defected from his position as vice president of Police in the Syrian province of Homs in 2012 to take on a role as the Amman-based spokesperson for the Southern Front, concurred that “some of the TOW rockets ended up with Al Nusra.”

In July 2017, citing its ineffectiveness and on recommendation from then-CIA director Mike Pompeo, President Trump ended the faltering Syrian rebel supply program. While the cost of the program and the amount of arms and aid provided remains mostly classified, it is estimated that more that $1 billion was spent on the effort.

The CIA declined to comment on this story. A spokesperson for the Defense Department acknowledged that they “clearly faced challenges” with the now-discontinued train-and-equip effort.",world
"California is one step closer to expanding Medicaid for illegal immigrants in the state, with legislation from both chambers of the legislature that could reach Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown’s desk.

The new legislation, introduced by Democratic State Assemblymember Dr. Joaquin Arambula, expands that program to cover undocumented young adults up to age 26.

“The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions,” the Assembly bill read. “The federal Medicaid program prohibits payment to a state for medical assistance furnished to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law.”

Arambula’s bill was initially slated to cover all undocumented adults, but was amended to expand coverage to just young adults under 26 years of age. That bill is expected to be considered in the California State Senate.

“This bill would extend eligibility for full-scope Medi-Cal benefits to individuals who are under 26 years of age and who are otherwise eligible for those benefits but for their immigration status,” the bill reads.

A spokesperson for Brown directed Fox News to Arambula’s office for comment.

On the other side of the Capitol, California state Sen. Ricardo Lara introduced similar legislation. This bill would cover undocumented minors up to the age of 19, and would expand the program to cover undocumented adults 65 years and older. Lara’s bill also was originally written to cover all undocumented adults, but was amended in Senate appropriations, according to a California state legislature source.

An aide in Arambula’s office told Fox News that the assemblymember’s bill was separate from Lara’s, but that both technically can pass and reach the governor’s desk.

“We are trying to address the fact that, whether you like it or not, our undocumented community needs the care, and we are paying for it anyway,” Lara told Politico.

A spokesperson for Lara did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

If the bills pass, California could become the first state in the nation to offer health insurance coverage to illegal immigrants, beyond the current policy.

The California Legislative Analyst’s Office told Modern Healthcare that offering full-cost healthcare coverage would cost the state $3 billon for the 2018-2019 year. When the legislation was introduced last year, the state was expected to spend $1 billion a year to provide healthcare to illegal immigrants.

“This is just more bad policy coming out of California. They make it more and more accommodating for illegal aliens and more and more middle class families are picking up and leaving California,” Federation for American Immigration Reform spokesman Ira Mehlman told Fox News.

“The best way to deal with illegal immigration is not to worry about or figure out how to pay for needs like healthcare, but to discourage people from breaking the law and bringing their kids here in the first place.”

Mehlman added: “California’s position seems to be that they’re going to continue to encourage people to come illegally and dream up new programs to encourage people, to the detriment of everyone else in California.",politics
"California State University's Fresno campus is investigating after one of their English professors tweeted she was ""happy"" former first lady Barbara Bush was dead just an hour after her passing was announced.

The author and professor, Randa Jarrar, tweeted a slew of comments about Bush, calling her ""a generous and smart and amazing racist who, along with her husband, raised a war criminal.""

OUTRAGE AS CALIFORNIA PROF CALLS BARBARA BUSH 'AMAZING RACIST' AND SAYS SHE'S HAPPY 'WITCH IS DEAD'

Bush, 92, died Tuesday night just days after her family announced her health was failing.

Amid the backlash to her tweets, Jarrar, who also said she ""can't wait for the rest of [the Bush] family to fall to their demise,"" said that she couldn't get fired from her job at Fresno State because of tenure.

“I work as a tenured professor. I make 100K a year doing that. I will never be fired. I will always have people wanting to hear what I have to say,"" she wrote on Twitter.

The university's provost, Lynnette Zelezny, referred to the professor's comments as ""disrepectful"" during a news conference Wednesday, and said the school is taking the situation ""very seriously.""

""We understand the concern from the community and we are taking this very seriously,"" Zelezny said, according to The Fresno Bee. ""To answer the technical question: Can she not be fired? The answer is no.""

Fresno State has reportedly not been in contact with Jarrar, who has been on a leave of absense during the spring semester.

BARBARA BUSH REMEMBERED BY POLITICIANS, LAWMAKERS AROUND THE WORLD: 'AN ADVOCATE OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY'

Following Jarrar's tweets Tuesday, the university's president, Joseph Castro, also distanced the school from the professor's controversial comments, saying they raise ""deep concerns"" and were made ""as a private citizen.""

In a statement, Castro extended the school's ""deepest condolences to the Bush family on the loss of our former First Lady, Barbara Bush.""

"Former Republican senator Jon Kyl was named Tuesday to succeed the late Sen. John McCain, with the announcement coming at the start of confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh -- which could be the new senator's first big vote.

Arizona GOP Gov. Doug Ducey announced the selection via Twitter, while saying during a subsequent news conference that Arizonans needed a person who would be able to ""hit the ground running.""

""I am deeply grateful to Senator Kyl for agreeing to succeed his friend and colleague of so many years. Every single day that Jon Kyl represents #Arizona in the U.S. Senate is a day our state is well-served,"" he tweeted.

Kyl, 76, may be a short-term pick. He only committed Tuesday to fill the Senate seat until early next year out of a ""sense of duty.""

""I haven't been able to get that assurance from Kyl yet, what I have gotten is a commitment to serve Arizona through at least this session of Congress,"" Ducey told reporters, adding that he hoped that Kyl ""serves longer.""

Kyl told reporters he did not want to commit for a longer period because when he left his Senate seat previously he had no intention of returning.

""In that spirit I am certainly willing to serve through the end of this session,"" he said.

Voters in 2020 will get to decide who fills the remainder of McCain's term through 2022. Then the seat will be up again for a full six-year term.

McCain's widow Cindy McCain had revealed the choice in an earlier tweet, saying, ""Jon Kyl is a dear friend of mine and John’s. It’s a great tribute to John that he is prepared to go back into public service to help the state of Arizona.""

Kyl was the GOP whip for a number of years, and also served as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s escort or “sherpa,” as the Senate sometimes calls it, taking Kavanaugh around to meet with senators.

He was absent at Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing on Tuesday, but Ducey told reporters that Kyl is ready to cast a vote after working with the White House for months on the Kavanaugh nomination.

The political stakes are high since Kyl could participate in the vote on whether to confirm Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, and will be rejoining the Senate at a time when Democrats are eager to take control of the chamber in this year's midterms.

A representative for Ducey told the Arizona Republic that if Kyl opted to step down at the end of the session, the Republican governor would have to appoint another replacement.

JOHN MCCAIN BURIED AT NAVAL ACADEMY NEXT TO LIFELONG FRIEND

Kyl retired in 2013 after becoming the No. 2 ranking Republican senator, and served alongside McCain during his 18 years in the Senate.

Filling McCain's seat marks a turning point in Arizona political history. That seat in particular has been held by two men who were heralded as giants of the Senate: McCain took the seat once held by Sen. Barry Goldwater after he had served in the House of Representatives.

Outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., called Kyl a ""great pick"" as McCain's replacement, and that it was Ducey's selection entirely.

“They worked together for eighteen years they served together so you know I think he’ll fit right in and he obviously shared Senator McCain’s view on most things and [is the] perfect, perfect guy to succeed him,"" Flake told Fox News.

McCain was buried on Sunday at the U.S. Naval Academy in a private ceremony, as per the wishes the Arizona Republican and 2008 presidential nominee who died Aug. 25 from brain cancer at age 81.

"Meghan McCain and President Barack Obama took apparent swipes at President Trump on Saturday in a eulogy for John McCain -- who sparred with Trump on a number of occasions before his death last week of brain cancer.

""The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great,' McCain's daughter said, in what appeared to be a reference to Trump's presidential campaign slogan: ""Make America Great Again.""

The remarks were made during a funeral service at Washington National Cathedral for the Arizona Republican, who died last week of brain cancer.

Obama's jabs were more subtle but still appeared to be directed at the current occupant of the White House. He derided those in politics who traffic in ""bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage.""

He also attacked ""a politics that pretends to be brave and tough but in fact is born of fear.""

""John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that,” he said.

It was Meghan McCain who had the most searing swipes at the president however. Notably she said that her father's passing represented the passing of ""American greatness. The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.""

Former President George W. Bush also paid tribute to McCain.

""John – as he was the first to tell you – was not a perfect man. But he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have yet conceived,"" he said. ""He was motivated by a vision of America carried ever forward, ever upward, on the strength of its principles.""

The funeral service notably did not feature President Trump, who had feuded with McCain, particularly during the presidential campaign. In 2015, after McCain had said Trump's platform had ""fired up the crazies,"" Trump had mocked McCain's imprisonment in the Vietnam War, saying: ""I like people that weren't captured."" Trump has also fumed about McCain's vote last year to kill off a bill to reform ObamaCare.

Both Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were in attendance. Trump, meanwhile, went to the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. He also tweeted about subjects including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Russian investigation.

A six-term senator and a Vietnam veteran who was held as a prisoner of war for more than five years, McCain pushed for bipartisanship on the Hill. He ran against Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. He clinched the nomination in 2008 but was defeated in the presidential election by Obama.

FAREWELL STATEMENT FROM JOHN MCCAIN

Other notable speakers included former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman.

""His death seems to have reminded the American people that these values are what makes us a great nation, not the tribal partisanship and personal attack politics that have recently characterized our life, "" Lieberman, who McCain considered for his vice-presidential nominee, said.

McCain’s pallbearers included actor Warren Beatty and Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Earlier Saturday, his casket traveled to the cathedral after stopping at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where McCain’s wife Cindy laid a wreath. Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly accompanied her.

On Friday colleagues, family and friends paid tribute to his service both in the military and the Congress as he lay in state underneath the Capitol rotunda.

JOHN MCCAIN HONORED AT US CAPITOL, LAWMAKERS PAY TRIBUTE TO 'GENERATIONAL LEADER'

With members of McCain’s family in attendance, Vice President Mike Pence said Americans “marveled at the iron will of John McCain” and praised him for holding fast “to his faith in America through six decades of service.”

“Generations of Americans will continue to marvel at the man who lies before us, the cocky, handsome naval aviator who barely scraped through school, and then fought for freedom in the skies; who witnessed to our highest values, even through terrible torture; and who became a generational leader in the United States Senate, where our nation airs its great debates,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said.

Tributes have poured in from both sides of the aisle for the Republican senator and 2008 presidential nominee. On Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden remembered McCain as a brother, and said the two were “cockeyed optimists” in a memorial service for McCain at a church in Phoenix.

Biden, a Democrat, declared that McCain’s “legacy is going to continue to inspire generations.”

McCain is to be buried Sunday at his alma mater, the U.S. Naval Academy, next to his best friend from the Class of 1958, Adm. Chuck Larson.

"The United Nations refugee agency on Friday pressed Greece to improve conditions at the crowded island camps where thousands of migrants are held as part of a European Union deal with Turkey.

The U.N. agency said in a statement that conditions in the camps, where nearly 20,000 people live, are ""squalid, inadequate and rapidly deteriorating.""

UNHCR also urged the Greek government to move more migrants from the eastern Aegean Sea islands to mainland Greece.

Tens of thousands of migrants illegally enter Greece every year from Turkey, hoping to move on to more prosperous European countries.

Under the EU-Turkey deal reached in 2016, they are supposed to be kept on the islands and returned eventually to Turkey. But in practice, most apply for asylum in Greece, while there is a steady flow to the mainland of people Greek authorities designate as members of vulnerable groups.

""UNHCR is particularly concerned about woefully inadequate sanitary facilities, fighting amongst frustrated communities, rising levels of sexual harassment and assaults and the increasing need for medical and psycho-social care,"" the agency statement said.

It said conditions were ""reaching boiling point"" at the Moria camp on Lesbos, where 7,000 people were living in accommodation designed for 2,000.

While, according to the UNHCR, more than 3,000 asylum seekers on the islands have been given authorization to move to the mainland, lack of accommodation facilities there are slowing the process.

Greece's interior ministry said 49 people reached the islands on Thursday, while 40 others were transferred to the mainland.

Migrants also cross from the land border with Turkey. On Friday, police said seven people were injured when a van carrying 24 migrants crashed on a highway near the border town of Alexandroupolis.

Also Friday, the coast guard said it stopped a yacht with 88 migrants and two suspected traffickers on board off the western island of Cephallonia. The vessel was believed to have been heading for Italy.",world
"Gov. Andrew Cuomo pardoned several illegal immigrants Monday in order to help them avoid deportation.

The New York Democrat, who is up for re-election this year, pardoned seven people who had minor criminal convictions, ranging from petty larceny to drug possession, his office said.

And with the pardons, Cuomo didn’t miss the opportunity to take a dig at the Trump administration and its “zero-tolerance” immigration policies that left thousands of minors separated from their families after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

“At a time when President Trump and the Federal government are waging a war on our immigrant communities, New York stands firm in our belief that our diversity is our greatest strength,” Cuomo said in a statement.

“While President Trump engages in policies that rip children out of the arms of their mothers and tries to ramp up the deportation of New Yorkers to advance his political agenda of hate and division, we will protect our immigrant communities,” Cuomo continued. “With the Statue of Liberty in our harbor, New York will always stand against the hate coming out of Washington and instead serve as a beacon of hope and opportunity for all.”

CUOMO CLAIMS HE’S ‘UNDOCUMENTED,’ CHALLENGES OFFICIALS TO DEPORT HIM

The separation of minors from their parents was swiftly and harshly criticized by many on both sides of the aisle. After the national outrage, Trump signed an executive order in June allowing families to remain together in detention. The administration is still working on reuniting those who have been separated; nearly 1,200 were reunited by this week.

According to the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency, a 2017 executive order from Trump expanded the agency’s focus to include removing immigrants who have been convicted or charged with a criminal offense, among other things.

Frank Barker, 43, was among those pardoned Monday, according to the governor’s office. He was convicted for criminal possession of stolen property and controlled substances and identity theft which stemmed from a drug addiction.

Also pardoned are: Jose Rafael Cruz, 53, who was convicted of a sale of a controlled substance; Ludames De La Cruz, 53, who was convicted for an attempted sale of a controlled substance; Elpidio Rodriguez, 57, who was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance and operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated; Tamar Samuda, 35, who was convicted nearly two decades ago for low-level assault and petit larceny; Marino Soto, 43, who was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance; and Carlos Suarez, 41, who was convicted for petit larceny.

CUOMO SIGNS REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS EXECUTIVE ORDER AHEAD OF TRUMP’S SCOTUS NOMINATION

Cuomo faces a primary challenger in Cynthia Nixon, an actress and progressive activist who has been credited with pushing the governor to the left in the race.

During the campaign, Nixon has called for the abolishment of ICE. Lauren Hitt, a spokeswoman for Nixon, told Newsday that while Cuomo’s pardoning was good, Nixon would do more to “end the deportation pipeline” by allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses.

Republican gubernatorial candidate Marc Molinaro’s campaign accused Cuomo of political grandstanding with the pardons.

“Everything Andrew Cuomo does is for his own political benefit, regardless of whether it’s right, wrong or dangerous to the public,” spokeswoman Katherine Delgado told Newsday. “In this case, it’s all about trying to out-liberal Cynthia Nixon for the September primary.”

Cuomo has pardoned 34 people since taking office, according to a news release.

"President Trump’s nominee for CIA director Gina Haspel on Wednesday defended her “moral compass” as she brushed back Democratic criticism of her handling of the post-9/11 detention and interrogation program -- while sharing gripping details about her credentials as a lifelong spy.

Haspel spoke at her confirmation hearing to replace now-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the agency's helm, and sought to head off criticism about her role in the interrogation of terror suspects. While GOP lawmakers and bipartisan voices from the intelligence community have strongly backed her bid, Democrats have threatened to stall her nomination over the Bush-era programs.

But under repeated questioning from Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee who were critical of that phase in her career, Haspel did not hesitate to remind them of the important role played by the intelligence community after the 9/11 attacks.

“After 9/11 … I stepped up. I was not on the sidelines, I was on the frontlines in the Cold War and I was on the frontlines in the fight against Al Qaeda,” she said in response to grilling from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a possible 2020 presidential candidate, also repeatedly pressed her to give a yes or no answer as to whether the prior interrogation program was immoral, and scolded her when she wouldn't: ""You also, in this hearing, have a responsibility to answer the questions being asked of you.""

But Haspel pledged early on the hearing that under her leadership, post-9/11-era interrogation would not be resumed.

“I have views on this issue, and I want to be clear. Having served in that tumultuous time, I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership on my watch CIA will not restart such a detention and interrogation program,” she said.

Haspel, currently the deputy CIA director, was chief of a base at a black-site prison in Thailand in 2002, where controversial interrogation techniques were used on detainees -- including waterboarding.

Senate Democrats have questioned her fitness to run the agency due to their objections to interrogation techniques. They have also complained that the CIA has failed to declassify enough information about her career, leaving the public in the dark about what sort of CIA director she may be. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has also said he will not vote for her confirmation.

At the hearing, Haspel said she was confident she would not allow the CIA to engage in illegal or immoral activity, even if it came from a presidential order.

“My moral compass is strong, I would not allow CIA to undertake activity that I thought was immoral even if it was technically legal -- I would absolutely not permit it.”

But some Democrats challenged her answers, particularly what Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., described as “legalistic” responses -- but Haspel refused to criticize actions by colleagues.

“I’m not going to sit here with the benefit of hindsight and judge the very good people who made hard decisions who were running the agency in very extraordinary circumstances at the time,” she said.

It did little to stop the criticism, however. “Where was that moral compass at the time?” Heinrich asked.

Haspel was also grilled about her role in the 2005 destruction of over 92 interrogation tapes. She testified that they were destroyed on the order of her supervisor at the time Jose Rodriguez and that she was not on the tapes, though she told senators she was an advocate for destroying the tapes to protect the identity of CIA agents.

In her opening remarks, the Kentucky-born Haspel described herself as a ""typical middle-class American -- one with a strong sense of right and wrong and one who loves this country.""

""I know CIA like the back of my hand. I know them, I know the threats we face, and I know what we need to be successful in our mission,"" she said. If confirmed, Haspel would be the first woman to lead the agency and said she had seen an ""outpouring of support from young women at CIA who consider it a good sign for their own prospects.""

She also offered dramatic and rare insight into her career as a spy, including her recollections of 9/11 as well as shadowy meetings with foreign contacts.

""I recall my first foreign agent meeting was on a dark, moonless night with an agent I’d never met before,"" she said. ""When I picked him up, he passed me the intelligence and I passed him extra money for the men he led. It was the beginning of an adventure I had only dreamed of.""

She also said she excelled in ""finding and acquiring secret information that I obtained in brush passes, dead drops, or in meetings in dusty back allies of third world capitals.""

Despite Democratic objections, Haspel has won strong support from the intelligence community and bipartisan former officials including from the Obama administration.

At the beginning of the hearing, Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., called her “a natural fit” for the role, and warned her opponents on the panel of turning the hearing into a ""trial about a long-shuttered program.""

“Those who have issued with programs or operations conducted years ago should address those concerns and questions to former presidents, former directors and former attorneys general,” he said.

During the hearing, a number of protesters interrupted Haspel's testimony and were removed from the committee room, yelling “no more torture” and “say no to Gina.” A number of “Code Pink” protesters remained in attendance throughout.

The tough questioning, meanwhile, has spurred accusations that Haspel is being held to a different standard than past nominees. In his 2013 hearing, former CIA director John Brennan, who supports Haspel, was asked about the same interrogation program and said he “did not take steps to stop the CIA's use of those techniques.”

Some outlets have accused Haspel of taking part in the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah, an alleged Al Qaeda terrorist. News site ProPublica, originator of the allegations, has since retracted the article, saying Haspel arrived to the base after the interrogation of Zubaydah ended.

But Leon Panetta, former CIA director and secretary of defense, said in a quote issued by the White House: “I’m glad it’s Gina because frankly she is someone who really knows the CIA inside out.”

She has also found significant support from Republicans, some of whom have made full-throated endorsements of her nomination.

“Haspel’s opponents have tried to use a small sliver of her career against her by arguing, essentially, that she was just too tough on Al Qaeda for this country to bear,” Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said in an op-ed for FoxNews.com. “But I’d argue that her willingness to serve in what was a highly stressful post only enhances the case for her confirmation.”

Fox News is told that the full committee likely won’t vote on her confirmation until next week. Haspel was reportedly preparing for the tough hearing by practicing her answers at mock confirmation hearings with former intelligence officials.

With the absence of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and the lack of support from Paul, it means that there is a maximum of 49 GOP votes for Haspel -- meaning that for her to be confirmed, some moderate Democrats would need to back her.

A senior Senate Democratic source indicated that Haspel would win support of several Democrats, and that it was unclear if the Democratic leadership would whip against Haspel.

Haspel's is the latest in a series of tough Trump-era confirmation fights. Pompeo was confirmed only after a contentious vote, while nominee for VA secretary, Dr. Ronnie Jackson, withdrew from consideration after allegations over his conduct as White House doctor.

"A Florida Circuit judge ruled Friday that that the state’s second-most populous county violated state and federal laws by destroying ballots from a 2016 Democratic primary race which Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz won.

Circuit Judge Raag Singhal decided that the records were wrongly destroyed because the laws require elections offices to keep the ballots in federal elections for 22 months. Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes destroyed the ballots just after 12 months, the Sun-Sentinel reported.

The judge also noted that because the ballots were subject to a lawsuit, only a court order should have allowed their destruction.

Snipes “has not presented any evidence refuting that the public records sought were destroyed while this case was pending before this court,” Singhal said.

Gov. Rick Scott’s administration announced shortly after the ruling that Florida’s Department of State will send election experts to the Broward elections office in the next election to “to ensure that all laws are followed.”

Snipes’ predecessor was fired from the elections office by former Gov. Jeb Bush and the Florida Senate after failing to ensure a smooth election process in the 2002 Democratic gubernatorial primary, according to Politico.

The lawsuit was brought by Tim Canova, the defeated Democratic primary candidate who sued the elections office after seeking to check for voting irregularities. He lost the primary race by nearly 7,000 votes to Wasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee.

Canova, who will be challenging the congresswoman again this year as an Independent, sought the paper ballots in March 2017, but was forced to sue three months later after he said Snipes failed to comply with the request and wanted to charge $72,000 to sort and produce the records, Politico reported.

Snipes testified that the push to destroy the ballots, which she did in September, was a “mistake,” adding that the boxes were mislabeled. She said “nothing on my part that was intentional.”

But the judge dismissed the argument, saying “Defendant's lack of intent to destroy evidence while this case was pending is irrelevant.”

An attorney for Snipes, Burnadette Norris-Weeks, said she will appeal the decision because the elections office never declined to provide the ballots to Canova, only objected to unreasonable demands.

“It was a mistake [destroying the original ballots], but the ballots were preserved,” Norris-Weeks told the Sun-Sentinel. “They were scanned shortly after the election.”

Canova is now pushing for Snipes to lose her job.

“I think dismissal is an appropriate remedy,” Canova told the newspaper.",politics

Noble words, and they used to mean something. But a disparity of justice is at the heart of our current crisis of faith in institutions. Americans aren’t outraged that the Federal Bureau of Investigation felt obliged to investigate allegations leveled at campaigns, or that a special counsel is looking at Russian electoral interference. They are instead furious that Lady Justice seems to have it in for only one side.

The country has watched the FBI treat one presidential campaign with kid gloves, the other with informants, warrants and eavesdropping. They’ve seen the Justice Department resist all efforts at accountability, even as it fails to hold its own accountable. And don’t get them started on the one-sided media.

And they are now witnessing unequal treatment in special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe. Yes, the former FBI director deserves credit for smoking out the Russian trolls who interfered in 2016. And one can argue he is obliged to pursue any evidence of criminal acts, even those unrelated to Russia. But what cannot be justified is the one-sided nature of his probe.

The controversy sparked calls by many Republicans for Democrats to vigorously denounce Farrakhan's remarks. Others who quickly condemned Farrakhan's remarks also asked pointed questions on why much of the media was either slow to report the story, or have chosen to ignore it entirely.

The Republican Jewish Coalition on Tuesday called on the seven CBC members to resign. The coalition’s director, Matt Brooks, told Fox News the Democratic leaders with ties to Farrakhan have been quick to denounce President Donald Trump and the GOP for remarks or actions that they view as bigoted, but overlook blatant racism and anti-Semitism when it comes to Farrakhan.

“There’s clearly a double standard,” Brooks said, then amended that to say “No, there’s a double double-standard. Not only do you get the progressive left wing and more centrist Democrats who aren’t shy about criticizing President Trump or branding the Republican Party as white nationalists or neo-Nazis, but when it comes to condemning Louis Farrakhan, they’re silent.”

The members called on to resign were the subject of a story in The Daily Caller, which reported a review of videos, photographs and other documents revealed the lawmakers have had ties to Farrakhan. They are Reps. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, Maxine Waters of California, Danny Davis of Illinois, Al Green of Texas, Barbara Lee of California, Andre Carson of Indiana, and Gregory Meeks of New York.

On Thursday, Meeks tweeted “Farrakhan's anti-Semitic messages are upsetting & unacceptable. I always condemn hate speech of any kind. Also upsetting that right-wing blogs suggest otherwise & try making this a black vs. Jewish community issue. Still waiting for those blogs to condemn Trump's racist remarks.”

Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who is not among those with ties to Farrakhan, took to Twitter to condemn the Nation of Islam leader and to say that he must be rejected, not courted.

""This is unacceptable in a progressive coalition or any political coalition,"" Schatz tweeted. ""Anti-Semitism has no place in American society. We must reject this, left right and center.""

Besides Meeks, Ellison has also condemned Farrakhan for his divisive and hostile rhetoric. Davis denounced anti-Semitism, but also praised Farrakhan, according to the Daily Caller.

In a statement on the Republican Jewish Coalition’s website calling for them to step down, Brooks wrote: ""Anti-Semitism is unacceptable. Farrakhan is the moral equivalent of a leader of the KKK. If it was discovered that members of Congress had met with the leader of the KKK, they would need to resign. In this case, for meeting with, and embracing, Louis Farrakhan, nothing short of resignation is acceptable from these seven Democrats.”

Earlier this week, a spokesman for Ellison, who is the deputy director of the Democratic National Committee, told Fox News: “Rep. Ellison has repeatedly disavowed anti-Semitism and bigotry, since his first campaign for Congress in 2006.”

The spokesman referred Fox News to a 12-year-old statement Ellison made when he came under fire for ties to Farrakhan, in which he said he erroneously dismissed concerns the Nation of Islam leader was anti-Semitic, and said he never shared “their hateful views” of “Jews, gays, or any other group.”

Recently, Ellison again was in the spotlight after the Wall Street Journal reported that he had attended a meeting in 2013 with Muslim leaders where Farrakhan was present. Ellison, who was the first Muslim elected to Congress, said he did not know who would be there and that his decision to go “was not an endorsement of the political views of other attendees.”

Davis, the Illinois congressman, said in a February interview with the Daily Caller that Farrakhan is an “outstanding human being” and said he sees the minister on a regular basis. Days later, Davis’s office released a statement denouncing anti-Semitism as being “antithetical to everything I believe and everything that I work for on a daily basis.”

Reactions to the call for resignations has varied, even among groups sharing similar views on many important matters.

In Jewishpress.com, writer David Israel argued that while Brooks was right to denounce Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism, he should not call for the resignation of lawmakers who have been pro-Israel, and are crucial congressional allies to Jews.

“Their Jewish voters and their Jewish colleagues in the Democratic party are entitled to an explanation about those Farrakhan meetings,” Israel wrote in Jewishpress.com, “but in politics, meeting a man, disturbing and loathsome as he may be, is not the same as endorsing his views. Pro-Israel Democrats have had enough trouble finding allies within the Black Caucus in Congress to face the Palestinian and BDS threats, to name just two.”

BDS refers to the Palestinian-led boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign that says Israel is responsible for violations of Palestinian rights and international law.

But Brooks rejected the contention lawmakers should be given a pass for “breaking bread with Farrakhan” because of other ways they can be useful to constituents.

“These [lawmakers] are leaders of the Democratic Party,” Brooks said. “If that’s enough for [David Israel], then why isn’t there the same standard when they criticize Donald Trump and other Republicans are who friends of Israel?”

“None of these Democrats went into those meetings with Farrakhan not knowing who he was,” Brooks said. “At some point they made the decision that they were going to go ahead and meet with him.”",politics
"Relentless monsoon floods in the southern Indian state of Kerala have left around 800,000 people displaced and nearly 10,000 others stranded, according to reports.

The death toll has risen to more than 350 from the floods and landslides, Reuters reported, citing information from the chief minister of the southwestern state.

The disaster represents the worst flooding in a century in Kerala, officials said.

Some 4,000 relief camps across the state sheltered the hundreds of thousands displaced.

Officials also pleaded for more help as the stranded people waited to be rescued by Monday.

""Please ask (Indian Prime Minister Narendra) Modi to give us helicopters, give us helicopters. ... Please, please!"" state legislator Saji Cherian said on a Kerala-based TV news channel, the Indian Express newspaper reported.

Authorities said they were being inundated with calls for assistance, local media reported.

""We are receiving multiple repetitive rescue requests,"" the office of the state's top official, Pinarayi Vijayan, said in a tweet.

At least two trains carrying about 400,000 gallons of water were moving to the flooded areas from the neighboring states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, Indian railway official Milind Deouskar said, according to the Press Trust of India news agency.

Rainfall in some areas were well over double that of a typical monsoon season, officials said.

The disaster drew attention in the United States from U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat.

“I’m horrified to see the loss of life and broader destruction caused by the continuing floods in Kerala. With more than a quarter of a million people displaced and hundreds dead, the human cost of this continuing tragedy is nearly unimaginable."" - Raja Krishnamoorthi, Congressman from Illinois

“I’m horrified to see the loss of life and broader destruction caused by the continuing floods in Kerala,"" the congressman said in a statement, according to the Indian Express.

""With more than a quarter of a million people displaced and hundreds dead, the human cost of this continuing tragedy is nearly unimaginable,"" he continued, ""and it is felt far beyond Kerala by countless families across the whole of India, here in the Chicago area, and throughout the world.""

The downpours that started Aug. 8 have triggered floods and landslides and caused homes and bridges to collapse across Kerala, a picturesque state known for its quiet tropical backwaters and beautiful beaches.

Initial storm damage estimates were nearly $2.8 billion, Vijayan said.

Prime Minister Modi inspected the flooded landscape from a helicopter and met Saturday with the state's top officials, promising more than $70 million in aid.

At least 36 more people were missing, according to Kerala's disaster management office.

Official said some people have also died in relief camps, Reuters reported.

“My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Kerala and their loved ones,” Krishnamoorthi said.

Officials also estimated that more than 6,200 miles of roads have been damaged.

More than 1,000 people have died in seven Indian states since the start of this year's monsoon season, including more than 300 in Kerala.

"President Trump on Saturday called on Democrats to end a “horrible law” that he says separates children from their parents when they cross the border -- and also accused them of “protecting MS-13 thugs.”

“Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there [sic] parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.” he tweeted.

Trump made the remarks amid a pushback from Democrats and activists at a “zero tolerance” policy enforced by the Justice Department. That policy refers all illegal border crossings for prosecution, including illegal immigrants with children.

Those parents are housed at adult detention centers, and consequently their children are separated from them, registered as “unaccompanied minors” and handed to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Trump has blamed Democrats for the separation of children from their parents before. Last week he told Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that the breaking up of families occurred because of “bad laws that the Democrats gave us.”

The Associated Press reported that he appeared to be referring to a 2008 law to combat child trafficking -- a bipartisan law authored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., but signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush.

While the law says nothing about separating families, it does say that children travelling alone from countries other than Mexico and Canada must be released in the “least restrictive setting” -- namely a family or shelter.

The Justice Department’s zero-tolerance policy, designed to deter prospective illegal immigrants, means that illegal immigrants are no longer released with their children into the U.S. and consequently that their children are separated from them.

“If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” Sessions said earlier this month. “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you, as required by law.”

SESSIONS SAYS ALL ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED; CHILDREN MAY BE SEPARATED FROM PARENTS

But Trump called on Democratic lawmakers to end the practice, apparently as part of a deal that includes the ending of so-called “catch and release” whereby illegal immigrants are released into America while they wait for their court hearing. He also said that the diversity lottery visa and so-called chain migration -- where immigrants can sponsor family members for visas -- must end.

“Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL!” he tweeted.

He also returned to accusing Democrats of “protecting” MS-13 gang members. He has said repeatedly that their opposition to strong border policies, as well as the promotion of “sanctuary policies” in states like California and New York, mean criminal gang members get released back into communities.

“Democrats are protecting MS-13 thugs,” he tweeted.

Trump was criticized by Democrats for describing MS-13 members as “animals.” This week he accused Democrats of “trying to defend” them, noting that he was criticized for his remarks by Democratic leaders Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY.

"Government forces in Afghanistan managed to free 149 people-- including women and children--who were abducted by the Taliban just hours earlier in the province of Kunduz.

Nasrat Rahimi, deputy spokesman for the Interior Ministry, says the insurgents still hold 21 others hostage following their ambush of a convoy of buses traveling in the Khan Abad district on Monday.

Mohammad Yusouf Ayubi, the head of the provincial council in Kunduz province, said the insurgents stopped the buses near Khan Abad district.

Ayubi believes the Taliban were looking for government employees or members of the security forces.

The attack occured despite President Ashraf Ghani's call for a cease-fire with the Taliban during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.

In a message released on the occasion of Eid al-Adha -- and without pointing to any cease-fire -- the Taliban leader said on Saturday that the insurgents remain committed to ""Islamic goals,"" the sovereignty of Afghanistan and ending the war.

Abdul Rahman Aqtash, police chief in neighboring Takhar province, says the passengers were fram Badakhshan and Takhar provinces and were traveling to the capital, Kabul.

There was no comment from the Taliban but the area of the incident is under Taliban control.

""So far, there is no news on the fate of the passengers, but tribal elders and local officials are trying to negotiate with the Taliban,"" Ayubi added.

"The manager of a popular restaurant in Vancouver, Canada, was fired after he told a customer to remove his “Make America Great Again” cap or he would refuse to serve him.

Darin Hodge, the former manager of the Teahouse in Stanley Park, told Global News he stood by his decision to ask the man to take off the cap saying the hat represented “racism, bigotry, Islamophobia, misogyny, white supremacy, (and) homophobia.”

“As a person with a strong moral backbone, I had to take a stand against this guest’s choice of headwear while in my former place of work. Absolutely no regrets,” he said in a written statement to Global News.

RUSSIAN TALKS WITH REBELS OVER SOUTH SYRIA COLLAPSE

The hats were made popular during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.

Eva Gates, of the Sequoia Group which owns the Stanley Park Tea House, confirmed to Global News that the incident happened on Tuesday.

“A gentleman came in wearing a hat that was a ‘Make America Great Again’ hat, and our manager went up to the gentleman and asked him to take off his hat, that he wouldn’t serve him with that hat on,” she said.

“And the gentleman said that he had a right to wear that hat. And [the manager] refused to serve him if he wouldn’t take off his hat, and so the customer had to leave,” she continued.

The company called Hodge a “good person with a big heart and a right to his personal beliefs,” but he was terminated for “violating the company’s philosophy of tolerance.”

The staff told CBC News that Hodge was employed with the restaurant for about 18 months.

“Her actions say far more about her than about me,” she tweeted. “I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so.”",world
"As the European Union decries America's restoration of Iran sanctions, the Islamic regime is rewarding Europe’s support by ramping up its terror operation on the continent -- allegedly plotting attacks against Iranian dissidents there and politicians who back them.

The Trump administration restored sanctions on the rogue regime this week, a consequence of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Obama-era Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). That move provoked a strong response from European leaders, who said they “deeply regret” the U.S. decision.

TRUMP REINSTATES IRAN SANCTIONS, SLAMS 'HORRIBLE' NUCLEAR DEAL



“The lifting of nuclear-related sanctions is an essential part of the deal,” E.U. High Representative Federica Mogherini, along with French, German and British foreign ministers, said in a joint statement, vowing to “protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran.”

But the regime, while facing significant unrest at home over corruption and mismanagement that has led to water shortages and food price hikes, allegedly has been exporting terror to Europe.

IRAN'S WIDESPREAD AND GROWING PROTESTS PUSH CITIZENS TO BRINK

Last month, an Iranian diplomat based in Vienna was one of four arrested for an alleged plot to bomb an annual gathering of Iranian dissident groups in Paris, which Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani attended.



German prosecutors allege that Assadollah Assadi was a member of the “Ministry of Intelligence and Security,” (MOIS) tasked with combating observation groups inside and outside of Iran. He is charged with activity as a foreign agent and conspiracy to commit murder. Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has called the allegations a ploy.



The Wall Street Journal reported that Dutch authorities expelled two Iranian diplomats in July linked to the assassination of one Iranian dissident who was murdered in the Hague in November.



There are also concerns about the regime’s presence in Albania, where dissidents told Fox News the Iranian embassy is staffing up and has sent top intelligence operatives. Albania is significant as it was where more than 2,000 Iranian dissidents belonging to People’s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) were relocated from Iraq in 2016.

The National Council of Resistance in Iran (NCRI) said that the regime wanted to murder them in Iraq, and the failure to do so marked a “major setback” for the regime.



Former Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko revealed to Fox News that he has been told by U.S. officials that he needs to increase his security after intelligence of a threat against him.

While he said Iran’s strategy in the region is “unprecedented,” he also told Fox News, “I am not afraid.”

A senior U.S. counterterrorism official confirmed to Fox News that Albanian authorities arrested two Iranian operatives on terror charges earlier this year.



“Iran has a long history over the last 39 years of conducting and planning assassinations and terrorist actions against opponents of the Iranian regime, including a series of assassinations and attack plots in recent years in European countries,” the official said.



U.S. officials have not been shy about calling out the terror plots. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a speech last month, pointed to the Paris attempt as proof of the regime’s intentions.



“This tells you everything you need to know about the regime: At the same time they’re trying to convince Europe to stay in the nuclear deal, they’re covertly plotting terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe,” he said.



Mohammad Mohaddessin, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), said in a statement to Fox News that there is no doubt that the plots are coming from the regime’s leadership.

“The Iranian regime’s foiled plots in Albania and in Paris were similar to the operations that ISIS carried out in terms of targeting big crowds and inflicting damage to a large number of people at once,” he told Fox News in a statement.

“These plots were decided and planned at one body, namely the Supreme National Security Council. These plots were approved by Ali Khamenei, the regime’s supreme leader, and were relegated to the MOIS to be carried out.”



The alleged terror threats are likely only to increase the pressure on the E.U. to abandon its opposition to sanctions and get on board with U.S. efforts to pressure Iran into either reform or regime change. This week, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley accused the bloc of “playing politics” on the issue.



“The E.U. can do what they want but you can’t condone the practices that are coming out of Iran, so the E.U. will have a decision to make,” Haley told Fox News on Wednesday.

"In cities thousands of miles apart, people from all walks of life are braving record heat to express their final feelings of R-E-S-P-E-C-T for two American icons – the great singer and musician Aretha Franklin and the great patriot and war hero Sen. John McCain.

At first glance, these two had little in common: a black woman who came from the Deep South and lost her mother before she turned 10; and a white man who was the son and grandson of Navy admirals.

Franklin was the daughter of a poor preacher. Despite becoming a mother at age 12, she used her God-given talents as a singer to reach the rarified status of music royalty. McCain endured unspeakable torture at the hands of a vicious enemy in North Vietnam, only to rise to the highest levels of government service, nearly becoming president of the United States.

Their paths to greatness were very different, but their stories are uniquely American. Both were motivated by the desire to give something to society and to America.

Franklin joyfully sang praises of the Lord in church as a girl and later brought audiences to their feet with stirring renditions of some of the most enduring soul songs in American history. Her song “Respect” – with the chorus R-E-S-P-E-C-T – was one of her biggest hits.

McCain went on after his release from North Vietnamese captivity as a prisoner of war to serve in the House and Senate as a leading advocate of policies that would keep our country strong and prosperous.

Both achieved the means to retire to very comfortable private lives, yet neither chose to. Until practically their last breaths, one stayed on stage sharing her gift of bringing people to tears of joy through song, and the other fought vigorously for the principles in which he so passionately believed.

Both touched the lives of millions, most of whom neither ever met. That’s why both will be eulogized by former presidents.

That people are lining up and waiting for hours to have just a moment to honor these two extraordinary individuals speaks well not only of them, but of us as a society. It says that we value talent, the celebration of life, courage, candor and sacrifice.

Some people come to honor Aretha Franklin and Sen. McCain because they actually had a relationship with them. Others feel like they did, or just admired what this great woman and great man contributed.

Some even brought or will bring their children for a teaching moment to point to an individual who did something great, and hopefully draw attention to the fact that limitless possibilities remain the promise of America.

At a time when people on both sides of the aisle are saying some pretty tough things, it is a nice respite to see what is happening in Phoenix and Detroit.

Yet it is a sad irony that both of these great Americans were felled by the same insidious disease: cancer. As much progress as has been made in beating many types of cancer, the fact remains that glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer are still among the most deadly and most vexing.

Rather than renaming a building or street to memorialize these two celebrated Americans, wouldn’t a more fitting tribute be the redoubling of our efforts – including through increased government funding – to finally beat the cancers that ended their lives?

It’s not that two are mutually exclusive, of course, but we should think beyond mere symbolic gestures and actually do something concrete to honor Franklin and McCain. Does anyone doubt that’s what they would want?

As America says goodbye to two individuals whose impact will last for generations, it is worth noting that in our country, anyone from anywhere can overcome any adversity and reach the top of his or her profession. In America, success is not reserved for the privileged few.

We wish Aretha Franklin and John McCain could have been with us longer, but we should all be grateful for their presence in this world and all they accomplished to make it a better place.",politics
"Japanese government officials said Monday that they were trying to ensure the safety of a Japanese tourist whom North Korea said it had expelled after detaining him on unspecified charges.

The official Korean Central News Agency said late Sunday that Japanese tourist Tomoyuki Sugimoto had been ""kept under control"" for questioning about ""his crime,"" without specifying what he had been accused of.

In a two-sentence report, the news agency said the authorities decided to ""to leniently condone him"" and expel him on the principle of humanitarianism.

Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that Japan's government was doing its ""utmost,"" but refused to give further details, citing the sensitivity of the issue.

Japan's government confirmed about two weeks ago that it was looking into reports that one of its citizens was being held in North Korea, but has not identified the person by name.

Japan's Kyodo News agency, citing a government source, said the person was believed to be a videographer in his 30s and may have been suspected of shooting video of a military facility while on a group tour to Nampo, a port city in western North Korea.

The government had sought his release through the North Korean Embassy in Beijing, Kyodo said. Japan does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea.

North Korea has also arrested other foreign nationals. Three Korean-Americans accused of anti-state activities and detained for more than a year were released and returned home in May with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when the two sides were preparing for the June summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. American college student Otto Warmbier, who was arrested by North Korean authorities in January 2016 after being accused of stealing a propaganda poster and sentenced to 15 years in prison, died in June 2017, days after he was repatriated to the U.S. with severe brain damage.

Their arrests were widely seen as politically motivated and had compounded the dire state of relations over North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

If the Japanese man's release is confirmed, his repatriation will have come quicker than some of earlier cases. A Japanese correspondent for the Nikkei newspaper was detained in North Korea for more than two years after being taken into custody on spying charges in Pyongyang in December 1999. His release was seen as an attempt by North Korea to get Japan to make concessions ahead of their planned normalization talks.

Japan and North Korea have also had disputes over abductions of Japanese citizens decades ago. Japan says North Korea abducted at least 17 Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s to train agents in Japanese language and culture to spy on South Korea. Pyongyang has acknowledged abducting only 13 of them and said eight of them had died. Five others allowed by the North to visit Japan in 2002 stayed.

"Across the country, far-left progressives and democratic socialists suffered decisive electoral defeats in Tuesday's primaries, despite high-profile barnstorming efforts by left-leaning leaders like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.



The routs were a sign not only that Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders may lack the star power necessary to bolster candidates, but also that national enthusiasm for socialism is generally weak as the U.S. economy posts strong unemployment numbers and sustained growth.

Earlier this month, former President Barack Obama pointedly declined to endorse Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist candidate in New York's 14th Congressional District, in a snub that underscored the challenges facing progressives campaigning to the left of the Democratic Party establishment in hopes of taking their views mainstream.

For Sanders, who vied for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2016 presidential race and may run again in 2020, the defeats Tuesday were a continuation of his recent losing streak. Over the past two years, several candidates he has backed in several important races -- including in gubernatorial primaries in Virginia and Ohio, and in several House races in Iowa and New Jersey -- have come up short.

Ocasio-Cortez, who unseated longtime establishment Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in a shocking June primary win, tweeted an acknowledgement of the rough day on Wednesday.

""Wins in the short-term are important milemarkers and necessary to building power,"" she wrote. ""But you can’t be afraid of loss. Fear keeps people from accomplishing great things.""

Such losses were plentiful for Ocasio-Cortez this week. Abdul El-Sayed, an avowed populist who was vying to be Michigan's first Muslim governor, finished nearly 20 percentage points behind establishment Democrat Gretchen Whitmer in Tuesday's primary.

DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE SNAPS AT REPORTER FOR ASKING ABOUT SOCIALISM: 'YOU F--KING KIDDING ME'?

Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez had aggressively trumpeted El-Sayed, who had advocated a $15 minimum wage, universal health care and free college tuition for families making under $150,000 annually. At a rally in Detroit this week, Sanders -- who defied expectations by winning the Michigan primary against Hillary Clinton in 2016 -- called El-Sayed's platform ""very bold.""

And Fayrouz Saad, who was angling Tuesday night to become the first Muslim woman elected to Congress, finished in a distant fourth place in Michigan's 11th Congressional District primary, despite support on the stump from Ocasio-Cortez.

In Missouri, Rep. Lacy Clay soundly defeated Cori Bush, who was also supported by both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez.

Ocasio-Cortez had spent a day in July in St. Louis campaigning on Bush's behalf, and called her ""one of the most inspiring people I've ever met in my life.""

Before the vote, Bush, 42, had sounded a note of optimism despite polls showing Clay to be the clear favorite: ""I actually feel like we have the momentum. I believe that we have what we need to be successful.""

And in Kansas, former Sanders staffer Brent Welder narrowly lost to Sharice Davids in the race for the Republican-held 3rd Congressional District, which Clinton carried in 2016. Democratic socialists had hoped a Welder win would prove their broad appeal to urban voters.

OCASIO-CORTEZ SHUNS WEST COAST ELITES IN WEST COAST TOUR

James Thompson, another Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez candidate, won his primary for Kansas' 4th Congressional District, but he is widely expected to lose in November against Republican Rep. Ron Estes. The race will be a rematch of the 2017 special election betwene Estes and Thompson in the largely Republican district.

Meanwhile, in Washington State, 30-year-old Sarah Smith billed herself as running on the ""same slate as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,"" and she was recruited by the same group that had backed the Bronx democratic socialist.

But Smith's challenge to longtime Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith in Tuesday's 9th Congressional District primary appeared unsuccessful as votes rolled in -- and the incumbent suggested that demographics were a major reason why his challenger could not replicate Ocasio-Cortez's success.

“Have you been to Queens, N.Y.?” Smith said in an interview with The Seattle Times before the vote, noting that Ocasio-Cortez is a Latina running in a strongly Hispanic district. “Queens is not SeaTac or Seattle, I am not Joe Crowley, and Sarah Smith is not Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Other than that, the comparison’s perfect.”

However, there was a bright spot for Ocasio-Cortez in the heavily gerrymandered, hyper-Democratic 13th Congressional District in Michigan, where Rashida Tlaib won the nod to replace retiring Rep. John Conyers. He announced his retirement amid sexual harassment allegations.

Tlaib will effectively run unopposed in November's general election, making it all but certain that she'll become the first Muslim woman elected to Congress.

She is also poised to become the second card-carrying member of the Democratic Socialists of America in Congress.",politics
"A group of 11 House Republicans introduced five articles of impeachment against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Wednesday evening.

The impeachment articles accuse Rosenstein of intentionally withholding documents and information from Congress, failure to comply with congressional subpoenas and abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

It was not immediately clear whether the House of Representatives would consider the resolution before lawmakers begin the August recess Thursday afternoon. The House will reconvene Sept. 4.

The resolution states it will be ""referred to the Committee,"" meaning the Judiciary Committee, for further review. That language suggests the full House will not immediately consider the articles of impeachment.

The articles were introduced by Reps. Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio, the chairman and a prominent member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.

In an exclusive interview on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" on Wednesday night, Meadows said it would be possible to effect a so-called ""privileged"" resolution on impeaching Rosenstein as early as Thursday morning, which would require a vote within two days -- although the impending House recess would likely delay that vote unless it were held quickly.

Both Meadows and Jordan told host Laura Ingraham the effort was long overdue.

""For nine months, we've asked for documents, and that's all we want,"" Meadows said. ""Not only have subpoenas been ignored, but information has been hidden, efforts have been stonewalled.""

""We've caught the Department of Justice hiding information, redacting information that they should not have redacted,"" Jordan charged, adding that Rosenstein had attempted to intimidate House staffers with subpoenas.

""We're tired of the Justice Department giving us the finger."" - Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan

""We're tired of the Justice Department giving us the finger,"" Jordan added. ""The American people are sick of it.""

Jordan said he had not spoken to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., about the impeachment articles, but said that ""The American people are with us -- that's what matters.""

But Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted that the articles ""were filed in bad faith and show [the] extraordinary lengths to which House Republicans will go to protect [President] Trump.""

And Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said the move was ""partisan nonsense.""

Schiff, joined by New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler and Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, also issued a joint statement calling the impeachment articles a futile ""direct attack on the Special Counsel’s investigation—full stop.""

In one article of impeachment, Rosenstein is accused of improperly signing off on the FISA surveillance warrant application against ex-Trump aide Carter Page.

DOJ RELEASES FISA DOCS THAT FORMED BASIS FOR CARTER PAGE SURVEILLANCE

The application heavily relied on the infamous Steele Dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the DNC and contained unverified, salacious allegations against Trump.

""Under Mr. Rosenstein’s supervision, the Department of Justice and FBI intentionally obfuscated the fact the dossier was originally a political opposition research document before the FISC [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court],"" the articles of impeachment state.

They continue: ""As Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Rosenstein has failed in his responsibility for the proper authorization of searches under FISA, and his conduct related to the surveillance of American citizens working on the Trump campaign has permanently undermined both public and congressional confidence in significant counterintelligence program processes.""

The documents also charge that Rosenstein has an impermissible conflict of interest.

“His conduct in authorizing the FISA surveillance at issue in the joint congressional investigation makes him a fact witness central to the ongoing investigation of potential FISA abuse,” the articles state. “Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein’s failure to recuse himself in light of this inherent conflict of interest and failure to recommend the appointment of a second Special Counsel constitute dereliction of duty.""

Rosenstein named Special Counsel Robert Mueller to lead the Trump-Russia probe after Rosenstein’s boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, recused himself from the investigation because of Sessions’ own role in the Trump campaign.

WATCH: ROSENSTEIN, FBI DIRECTOR GRILLED BY HOUSE REPUBLICANS

He has since clashed with House Republicans for months over requests for Department of Justice documents. GOP leaders grilled Rosenstein at a hearing in June for what they called his inadequate transparency.

In recent weeks, calls by top Republicans to remove Rosenstein grew louder. A simple majority of the House would suffice to impeach Rosenstein, but a two-thirds vote of the Senate would be required to remove him.

The move came about two hours after GOP lawmakers met with Justice Department officials who have been working to provide documents to several congressional committees about decisions made during the 2016 presidential campaign. The department has provided lawmakers with more than 800,000 documents, but Meadows said after the meeting that there was still ""frustration"" with how Justice has handled the oversight requests.

It was not immediately clear whether the Republicans' move would affect the DOJ's document production to the House, which GOP leaders have been more pleased with in recent weeks.

House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said after the meeting that he was pleased with the department's efforts and wouldn't support Rosenstein's impeachment. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also said he is satisfied with progress on the document production.

"President Trump and his legal allies fired back Wednesday at his former attorney Michael Cohen after the leak of a taped conversation in which the two appear to discuss the possibility of buying the rights to a Playboy model’s story claiming an affair with Trump.

“What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad!” Trump tweeted.

The president was referring to how the tape cut out immediately after the discussion in question. Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, claimed to Fox News that the rest of the recording would have been “exculpatory from the point of view of the president.”

The release of the tape amounted to a stunning release of evidence, seized as part of the FBI raid on Cohen earlier this year. It forced Trump’s legal team to scramble to counter suggestions that Trump was well aware of talks to buy the rights to model Karen McDougal’s story, despite claims to the contrary.

Giuliani, speaking with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, host of “The Ingraham Angle,” maintained Tuesday that Trump did not know about the proposed transaction before the conversation.

“There’s no indication of any crime being committed on this tape,” he said.

Alan Dershowitz, Harvard law professor emeritus, also told “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday morning the controversy amounts to a “big deal about nothing.”

“The end result is no payments were made, no cash was given,” he said. “There’s no crime here. There’s no impeachable offense here.”

Dershowitz also slammed Cohen, saying he’s “not as loyal to the president as he once was” and “shouldn’t have recorded this.”

Cohen for weeks has put distance between himself and Trump amid a federal investigation surrounding, among other things, a separate payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about a separate alleged sexual encounter with Trump. Cohen recently told ABC his family has his “first loyalty.”

The tape was provided to CNN Tuesday by Cohen's attorney and longtime Clinton confidant Lanny Davis. The recording, made before the 2016 election, has them discussing a possible payment to buy the story of former Playboy model McDougal.

Trump’s legal team says the transaction never occurred.

On the recording, Cohen tells Trump: ""I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David,"" a possible reference to David Pecker, Trump's friend and president of the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc. The conversation came weeks after the parent company reached a $150,000 deal to pay McDougal for her story of a 2006 affair, which it never published, a tabloid practice known as ""catch and kill.""

Cohen then starts to say: ""When it comes time for the financing,"" at which point Trump cuts him off and says, ""What financing?""

What comes next is garbled and ultimately unclear. Cohen says they’ll “have to pay” something, and Trump can be heard saying “pay with cash” – after which Cohen repeatedly says “no, no, no.”

A transcript provided by the Trump legal team, though, asserts that Trump said: “Don’t pay with cash . . . check.”

Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday they listened numerous times to the tape and determined the then-candidate told Cohen, “Don’t pay with cash.”

Giuliani, speaking with Laura Ingraham, admitted that the audio was muffled, but said the rest of the recording -- had it not stopped -- would have been “exculpatory.” Dershowitz and Guiliani both said Trump wanted to make sure any such transaction had a record.

CNN on Tuesday played the secretly recorded audiotape from two months before the 2016 presidential election.

Davis told CNN that Trump’s lawyers “fear” Cohen because he “has the truth” about Trump. He questioned claims that Trump wasn’t talking about “cash.”

“Cohen has been disparaged. Cohen has been insulted and called all sorts of things by people around Donald Trump,” he said.

Trump denies the alleged affair ever happened and his campaign had said he knew nothing about the payment.

U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, posted on Twitter that the Cohen tape shows that Giuliani was ""untruthful"" when he said Trump didn't know about the payments. He said the move was ""campaign motivated"" and ""regardless of cash or check, whole point of phony corp. was to hide campaign expenditure.""

"WASHINGTON -- Many in the intelligence community have been quietly dismayed by the hyperbolic partisan behavior of former CIA director John Brennan since Donald Trump took office. But by revoking Brennan's security clearance, President Trump has managed to turn Brennan from an embarrassment into a martyr.

The response to Trump's action has been like the scene in the 1960 movie ""Spartacus"" when a Roman general announces to a group of rebel slaves that they will be spared the punishment of crucifixion -- but only if they turn in Spartacus, the leader of the revolt. One by one, the slaves stand up and shout, ""I am Spartacus.""

As former CIA director Michael Hayden has pointed out, a similar scene is playing out today in the intelligence community. The first to yell ""I am Spartacus"" was retired Adm. William H. McRaven, former head of U.S. Joint Special Operations Command, who declared in a Post op-ed, ""I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency.""

Then 12 former CIA directors, CIA deputy directors and directors of national intelligence declared in a joint letter that they, too, were Spartacus: ""You don't have to agree with what John Brennan says (and, again, not all of us do) to agree with his right to say it, subject to his obligation to protect classified information."" The number of signatories is now at 15.

They were soon joined by 60 former CIA officers, who signed a letter of their own and released it Friday evening declaring they were Spartacus. ""Our signatures below do not necessarily mean that we concur with the opinions expressed by former Director Brennan or the way in which he expressed them,"" they wrote, but ""the country will be weakened if there is a political litmus test applied before seasoned experts are allowed to share their views."" By Tuesday, the number of signatories had grown to 177 and included former senior officials from the State, Defense and Justice departments as well as the National Security Council and even NASA.

Note the pains the writers of both letters took to distance themselves from both the substance and style of Brennan's attacks on Trump. Brennan's conduct has been deeply controversial in intelligence circles -- and with good reason. After the Justice Department fired former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe (whom the inspector general determined had inappropriately authorized the disclosure of sensitive information and then misled investigators), Brennan lashed out at Trump, declaring on Twitter, ""When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history."" Brennan has also warned Republican members of Congress that ""Legislators who try to protect [Trump] will face November reckoning.""

But, most egregious of all, Brennan accused Trump of treason, tweeting that Trump's performance at his Helsinki news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin ""rises to & exceeds the threshold of 'high crimes & misdemeanors'"" and ""was nothing short of treasonous."" This was both outrageous and absurd. A news conference, however embarrassing, is not an impeachable offense. On Sunday, an incredulous Chuck Todd told Brennan on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" ""You are the former CIA director accusing the sitting President of the United States ... of treason. ... That's a monumental accusation."" Brennan stood by his ridiculous accusation.

Even some former officials deeply concerned by Trump's policies and behavior have been taken aback by the barrage of partisan invective. James R. Clapper Jr., who worked for President Barack Obama alongside Brennan as director of national intelligence, recently complained, ""John and his rhetoric have become an issue in and of itself."" Retired Adm. Mike Mullen, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Obama, said Brennan's partisan criticism of Trump ""has put him in a political place which actually does more damage for the intelligence community."" He's right. Brennan's actions have harmed the intelligence community, which prides itself on staying above the partisan fray, and have fed the narrative of a ""deep state"" seeking to undermine Trump.

But revoking Brennan's security clearance has not hurt Brennan. To the contrary, Trump has rescued Brennan from his own partisan hackery and given him an even greater platform from which to spew his bile. Indeed, the president admitted as much on Friday, saying, ""If anything, I'm giving him a bigger voice.""

Yes, Mr. President, you are -- and that is a big mistake.",politics
"The only incomplete 9/11 memorial site in the country gets its final major component this year. The Tower of Voices, the final part of the Flight 93 National Memorial, is making its debut Sept. 9 in Shanksville, Pa., the National Park Service says.

The Tower, standing 93 feet tall to represent United Airlines Flight 93, will have 40 wind chimes to represent each of the 40 passengers and crew members killed in the plane's highjacking, National Park Service's Chief of Interpretation and Education MaryJane Hartman told Fox News.

""40 is a very significant number,"" Hartman said, adding that 40-degree angles are seen throughout the structure. She noted that the number 40 also represents Flight 93’s angle of impact, as well as the degree of the branches on the hemlock trees that were destroyed by the plane.

Lorraine Bay was a senior flight attendant on that United Airlines flight, and for families like Bay’s, this memorial will serve as a reminder of the lives lost.

""She was the cool older sister that I never had,"" Ed Root, Bay's cousin, told Fox News.

""Wishing you lasting success in all of your endeavors. Love, Lorraine,"" Root read aloud from a note his cousin gave him. He said he always looked forward to family gatherings with her.

""Christmas Eves were always a highlight of the year,"" he remembers. ""Thanksgivings were always a highlight of the year.""

On 9/11, there was only one word to describe what he felt when a voice on the other end of the phone gave him the news.

""Shock,"" Root said.

Over the past several years Root got to know the other families whose loved ones had also died in the crash.

""The nicest people we should have never had to meet,"" Root said, adding that this was a phrase they had heard throughout the years of grieving.

The National Park Service says the planning and funding of the Tower of Voices has been a years-long process.

""It’s been a very long haul,"" Hartman said. ""It's been nearly 17 years to get this memorial completed.""

Before the first piece of the Tower was placed on the ground, one construction coordinator said 9,000 planning hours had gone into the project.

""You're only going to get one shot at doing this and everybody wants it to be right,"" Guy Fiore told Fox News.

For Rot, the dedication of the Tower will be a bittersweet moment.

""I think whenever I hear those chimes or see those chimes, I’ll hear Lorraine's voice,"" he said.

""It is the only wind chime structure of its kind that we know of in the world,"" Hartman said, adding that the chimes' sounds will each be unique to represent each of the 40. ""There is that little bit of discord...to represent the struggle and the fight that occurred on Flight 93.""

The dedication of the Tower of Voices will be held at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania on Sept. 9.",world
"Dozens of gang members, some of whom belonged to the notorious MS-13, were shielded from deportation and released due to ""sanctuary"" policies last year, according to newly released stats from the Department of Homeland Security.

The revelation could jolt the escalating ""sanctuary"" debate, especially in California where many of those gang members were located.

""Two-thirds of the releases occurred in California, which has had a strict sanctuary policy in effect since January 2014,"" the Center for Immigration Studies said in a post on the data, pointing to ""obvious public safety problems.""

Gang members released due to 'sanctuary' policies, by state From Oct. 1, 2016 to June 19, 2017: Arizona: 1 California: 89 Illinois: 3 Louisiana: 2 Maryland: 13 Minnesota: 1 New Jersey: 2 New Mexico: 2 New York: 4 Oregon: 2 Rhode Island: 1 Texas: 11 Washington: 11 Data from Department of Homeland Security

DHS officials provided a breakdown of gang members that were released in fiscal 2017, in response to questions posed in June by the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing on the rise of MS-13.

From October 2016 to June 2017, DHS says, sanctuary jurisdictions refused to honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers on 142 suspected gang members -- where ICE officials ask authorities to detain criminal illegal immigrants so ICE can take custody and deport them.

In the answers, the officials added that the numbers may be on the conservative side as jurisdictions that do not allow officials into jails make it more challenging to identify gang members.

""Because ICE often determines gang affiliation through interviews, ICE cannot speculate about the number of times it was denied access to an alien in the custody of state or local authorities who may have had such an affiliation,"" the answers read.



Fifteen of those released were suspected members of MS-13, a gang started in the 1980s by Central American immigrants and known for its gruesome crimes. The gang's presence across the country has been an escalating political issue.



“Violence is a central tenet of MS-13, as evidenced by its core motto -- “mata, viola, controla,” translated as, ‘kill, rape, control,’ the DOJ said in a 2016 release.

WHAT IS MS-13, THE VIOLENT GANG TRUMP VOWED TO TARGET?

The majority (89) of suspected gang members released were in California -- whose state leaders are locked in a high-profile battle with the Trump administration, and even some of its own cities, over the state’s sanctuary policies. The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state last month, claiming that the policies prevent federal authorities from enforcing immigration laws.



On Tuesday, San Diego County became the latest local jurisdiction to back the lawsuit, claiming it limits police cooperation with federal agents. San Diego County is the largest county so far to back the suit, and its move comes after Orange County has also supported the administration.



California Gov. Jerry Brown said Tuesday that President Trump’s stance against illegal immigration is “just an inflammatory football that very low-life politicians like to exploit.”

SAN DIEGO VOTES TO JOIN TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S LAWSUIT AGAINST CALIFORNIA'S SANCTUARY CITY LAW

If Trump “wants to round them up like some totalitarian government and ship them out, say that,” Brown said. “But he doesn’t say that because the American people would repudiate him and his party.”

Trump has repeatedly hailed the pushback against Brown and on Wednesday tweeted that there was a “revolution” in the state against sanctuary policies, which he called “ridiculous, crime infested & breeding concept.”

ICE figures show a surge in arrests related to MS-13. In fiscal 2017, there were 796 arrests of MS-13 members, compared with 432 in fiscal 2016 and 322 in fiscal 2015. More broadly, ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) said that 5,396 gang members were removed in fiscal 2017, compared with 2,057 in fiscal 2016.

DHS is also calling for tougher border security measures to combat MS-13.

In the questions posed to DHS officials, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, asked officials whether a border wall would stem the violence from MS-13, to which the officials said it would, calling it a “cornerstone” in preventing criminals from entering the country.



“The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) believes further securing our border will impact the medium- and long-term health of MS-13 and the level of violence it perpetrates,” the response said. “As many current MS-13 gang members are illegal border entrants, DHS believes increasing border security will discourage the arrival of both current gang members and potential recruits.”



Additionally, officials said that MS-13 members regularly exploit border vulnerabilities and that U.S. Border Patrol agents arrest MS-13 members trying to enter the country “on a near-daily basis.”

"The U.S. economy will stay on the upswing during the Trump administration despite the warnings of critics who have a ""vested interest in seeing us fail,"" Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told ""Fox News Sunday.""

Mulvaney specifically credited the White House's efforts to eliminate regulations, as well as the GOP-led Congress' massive tax bill, which was passed in 2017. Key provisions of the legislation took effect earlier this year.

""The things we’ve done on the deregulatory agenda, the things we’ve done on taxes, are not a sugar high,"" Mulvaney said. ""It’s not a one-time sort of 'pop' to the system. It’s fundamentally changing the way we create wealth in this country.""

Mulvaney continued: ""We do think it’s sustainable in the long-term. In fact, I think we’re already starting to see some folks project that we’re gonna have maybe again at least three percent [gross domestic product growth], maybe four percent growth again this quarter.""

GDP SHOWS BOOMING 4.1 PERCENT GROWTH AS TRUMP TOUTS 'AMAZING' NUMBERS

In July, a highly anticipated Commerce Department report showed the U.S. economy grew by 4.1 percent from April through June, marking the fastest quarterly economic expansion in nearly four years.

The growth was the largest since the economy's roughly 5-percent surge in the third quarter of 2014, which was the sharpest economic expansion since the third quarter of 2003.



Mulvaney rejected the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assessments that GDP growth will slow. Analysts have cautioned that some of the GDP growth reported by the Commerce Department could be attributed to a surge in soybean and other exports, as international buyers purchased the goods ahead of the expected implementation of bruising retaliatory tariffs.

""Keep in mind -- all of the folks who are now saying it’s just a short-term sugar high, it’s just a blip, it’s not sustainable, including the CBO, are the same people who said it was impossible to get to three percent in the first place,"" Mulvaney told Fox News' Chris Wallace. ""They have a vested interest in seeing us fail.

""All signs are good that we’re gonna actually get some spending bills passed before the end of the fiscal year,"" he added.

Mulvaney also suggested that President Trump had canceled his planned military parade in Washington, D.C. for reasons unrelated to funding.

""If the parade had been cancelled purely for fiscal reasons, I imagine I would have been in the room when that decision was made,"" he said. ""And I wasn’t, so my guess is there were other contributing factors.""

Mulvaney added that D.C. is a heavily liberal area, and suggested it would not be unreasonable to assume officials there would stand in Trump's way.

Trump, for his part, has laid the blame squarely at the feet of D.C. politicians.

""When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. Never let someone hold you up!"" Trump tweeted.

"Just when we thought it was too good to be true that Democrats were still touting House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California as the face of their party, they’ve come back with an even greater gift for Republicans – democratic socialist congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, running as a Democrat for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives from New York City.

Over the last several weeks we've seen a dramatic increase in discussion of socialism and what it actually means, sparked mostly by the Democrats onboarding of the 28-year-old Ocasio-Cortez after her surprise primary victory that made her a House candidate.

Many conservatives get angry at the sight of Ocasio-Cortez on TV news programs. I welcome her – and the Republican Party should as well. We must appreciate the opportunity to contrast our free-market platform with the socialist ideas of a former bartender who has said she believes that ""unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs.""

It’s a no-brainer that every Republican should welcome a debate with this disciple of democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, with her many radical positions.

I was a physician in rural Kansas for almost 30 years before I was elected to Congress in 2016. So personally, I believe the most practical way we can crush the rise of democratic socialists is to tear apart their most popular proposal: Medicare for all.

There is no such thing as “Medicare for all.” That phrase in and of itself is a complete and total scam.

Medicare only exists because a free-market health-care system allows it to exist. Medicare can only function within a relatively open market system that still inspires America's best and brightest to become doctors, nurses, and health-care innovators.

If you want to see what “Medicare for all” looks like, look no further than the last 25 years of the Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. I would encourage socialists like Ocasio-Cortez to ask a veteran dependent on the VA what he or she thinks of their government-run health care – but Ocasio-Cortez won't do that.

It is no secret that despite the strides President Trump and this Congress have made, there is still much work to be done for our vets when it comes to offering them quality health care.

No pundit, politician or health-care professional can deny that due entirely to the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and government-mandated electronic medical records, more physicians and nurses are quitting or opting for early retirement than ever before.

What it all comes down to is control versus choice. The Democrats (socialists) fundamentally believe that Washington knows what’s best for you and your family – better than you do. In contrast, the Republican Party still strongly believes that when given choices in the marketplace of products, ideas and health care, the individual knows what’s best for his or her family.

Socialized medicine means agencies would have the power to decide which doctor you take your children to, or what hospital should treat your aging parents and relatives. A vote for these socialist Democrats means rationing health-care services, waiting months to see a primary care physician, and waiting two to three years for joint replacement or a basic heart catheterization.

There will be a government-coded formula for deciding which patients – if any – will be treated for Stage 4 cancer, dialysis or an organ transplant. Socialists and the modern Democratic Party know that as soon as they control your health-care, they control you.

The key to the Democratic (socialist) success is that they need you to be convinced that you need them. Just don't ask them how they're going to pay the $3 trillion per year price tag.

At its core, socialism is a pseudo-religious belief that big-government central planning can take what it wants and give what it wants. It is that very same reason why socialism always ends up dying by the same sword – tyranny.

Once socialism fails, there is nowhere else for the individual to turn. Because of the inevitable failure of socialism, the only people that prosper under its tyranny are the apparatchiks who control the central government. They always live well, while everyone else’s families descend into horrific poverty.

For example, Google ""Venezuela"" – where some people in what was once a wealthy country eat out of dumpsters. Or research why China and Vietnam abandoned their failed “five-year plans"" of government-controlled economies and turned to free enterprise incentives so that they could feed their people.

Countries quickly learned that in the measly five acres their farmers were permitted to grow corps for sale at free-enterprise-based “farmers markets,” they produced more food than 100 acres they farmed for the state.

History is littered with the tattered remains of the socialist dogma of Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez and now the Democratic Party’s midterm platform.

Ocasio-Cortez and the socialists in Congress like to fly the banner of open borders and immigration. Well, I don't know a single immigrant in Kansas who dreamed of coming to the United States chasing the beaming light of socialism. I’ll be damned if I turn my country and my grandchildren’s future over to socialism.

Defeating the Democrats and their socialist poster candidates will remain our priority this fall, and we will succeed. In the meantime, Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are welcome back to my home state of Kansas anytime; they spend money in the state and get votes for the Republican Party.",politics

Sweden is holding a general election Sunday, the first since the country took in a record number of migrants from the Middle East and Africa in 2015 on top of the hundreds of thousands admitted before.

While the borders are now largely closed, a backlash against the earlier open-door policies is set to give historic gains to the Sweden Democrats, an anti-immigrant party with neo-Nazi roots. The center-left government is expected to take a battering.

The rising prospects of a far-right, euroskeptic party is turning this election into one of Sweden's most crucial political events in years. A look at the key issues and players in the election:

IMMIGRATION: A KEY ISSUE

Sweden, the largest of the Scandinavian countries with 10 million people, has been welcoming and generous to migrants and refugees for decades. Many Swedes have long cherished humanitarian values as a centerpiece of the national identity.

But after Sweden took in 163,000 migrants in 2015 alone — the largest number per capita of anywhere in Europe — Prime Minister Stefan Lofven conceded it could no longer cope with the influx. Though border controls have been tightened, many Swedes feel shaken by a rising sense of insecurity fueled by reports of rapes, car burnings and gang violence in migrant neighborhoods. Some also express anxiety that Sweden is losing its cultural heritage.

""A lot of people are fed up with the immigration that we have, because it's too many people. But you don't want to say it openly if you don't know who is listening,"" said Marianne Froberg, a 72-year-old who supports the center-right Moderates. That longstanding taboo, however, is now disappearing.

The vote is being watched internationally to see how well the once-fringe Sweden Democrats do amid a populist surge in Europe. In Germany, Austria and Italy — countries that have received large shares of migrants — populist, anti-migrant parties have made strong electoral gains since 2015.

Among those painting Sweden as a symbol of failing multiculturalism is U.S. President Donald Trump, who has cited the country as an example of how large-scale migration brings violent crime and insecurity. Swedes are divided over that view.

___

OTHER ISSUES

Sweden's economy is strong, and unemployment has gone down to around 6 percent. Health care, education and climate change are among issues at stake — but even those are sometimes viewed through the filter of migration. Voters are complaining that waits are increasing at clinics and hospitals, with some blaming that on the many newcomers. Sweden's liberal abortion law has also become an issue because the Sweden Democrats have proposed to lower the legal limit for abortions from the current 18 weeks to 12, sparking fears by some that it would erode women's rights.

___

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The main contenders are the center-left Social Democrats, who have dominated Swedish political life for a century and are credited with building Sweden's welfare state. They are led by 61-year-old Lofven, the prime minister, who is governing in a coalition with the Green Party.

The Social Democrats have easily won 40 percent of the votes in the past, but this time polls are showing their support at around 25 percent. That would be their worst result ever.

The center-right Moderates, led by Ulf Kristersson, 54, have long been the country's second major political force. Kristersson became party leader last year and has been in parliament since 2014. Over the past four years the Moderates were the largest of four members of the opposition bloc, the Alliance.

___

THE CHALLENGERS

As those two traditionally dominant parties weaken, the key beneficiary is expected to be Jimmie Akesson, 39, who has led the Sweden Democrats since 2005 and helped reform what was once a white supremacist party.

Akesson has imposed a zero-tolerance policy on open expressions of racism and xenophobia by party members, and some have been expelled for expressing pro-Nazi views. He has also changed the old party symbol, a flaming torch, into a friendly blue and yellow flower.

Akesson, a former leader of the party's youth branch, was elected to parliament in 2010.

Support for the Sweden Democrats has swollen to around 20 percent — up from the 13 percent it won in 2014. While 20 percent would not be enough for the party to lead a government, a strong show of support will give the party greater power to pressure the next administration.

Other smaller parties in the running include the Green Party and the Liberals, part of the center-right Alliance.

___

THE VOTE

Swedes will elect lawmakers to four-year terms in the 349-seat parliament as well as to local offices in cities and municipalities on Sunday. Polls will open at 8 a.m. local time (0600 GMT) and close at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT), though some Swedes have already taken part in early voting that began Aug. 22. Some 7.5 million registered voters will choose from almost 6,300 candidates countrywide.

A party must pass a 4-percent threshold to enter parliament. With several parties in the running, it's highly unlikely that any single party will get a majority, or 175 seats, and it could take weeks or even months of coalition talks before a government is formed.

Olsen reported from Copenhagen, Denmark.",world
"Some Democrats have joined the call to abolish the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency – especially under President Trump’s administration.

ICE was created through the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in 2001. According to its website, ICE “was granted a unique combination of civil and criminal authorities to better protect national security and public safety in answer to the tragic events on 9/11.”

Housed within DHS, ICE is in charge of executing hundreds of federal immigration statutes.

As more Democrats push back on the Trump administration’s immigration policies – including the “zero-tolerance” policy for illegal immigrants that resulted in thousands of children being separated from their families until the president signed an executive order –some are seemingly warming up to the idea that ICE should be eradicated or completely redone.

While some Democrats see calling on ICE to end could be a winning way to rally the party’s base in the 2020 presidential primaries, others have waffled on the idea or been unsupportive completely.

Trump suggested that Democrats who continue to push for abolishing ICE will “get beaten so badly” in the 2018 midterm elections in an interview with Fox News.

“You know ICE, these are the guys that go in and take MS-13, and they take them out because they’re much tougher than MS-13, like by a factor of 10,” Trump said. “You get rid of ICE, you’re going to have a country that you’re going to be afraid to walk out of your house.”

From lawmakers to congressional candidates, read on for a look at some Democrats who have begun to call for the abolition of ICE.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, New York

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, seen as a potential 2020 contender, told CNN in late June that she believes ICE should be abolished. The New York Democrat said ICE has “become a deportation force” and said we “should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont

In a series of tweets, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said “it is time to do what Americans overwhelmingly want: abolish the cruel, dysfunctional immigration system we have today and pass comprehensive immigration reform.”

ICE and other agencies would need to be restructured, Sanders continued.

“Congress must do what the American people want. Let us create a humane and rational immigration system,” Sanders said.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts

Speaking at a rally in Boston on June 30, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., slammed Trump’s immigration policies, saying he “seems to think that the only way to have immigration rule is to rip parents from their family ... treat rape victims and refugees like terrorists and to put children in cages,” according to Real Clear Politics.

“The president’s deeply immoral actions have made it obvious we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our morality and that works,” Warren said.

Rep. Earl Blumenauer, Oregon

While comparing ICE to broken phone app or computer program, Rep. Earl Blumenauer said of ICE to “shut it down” in a June 24 blog post. He noted that he voted against the creation of the agency in 2002.

TOP DEMOCRATIC SENATOR BUCKS CALLS TO ABOLISH ICE: ‘WE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO NEED IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT’

“We should abolish ICE and start over, focusing on our priorities to protect our families and our borders in a humane and thoughtful fashion,” Blumenauer said. “Now is the time for immigration reform that ensures people are treated with compassion and respect. Not only because it is the moral thing to do, but it’s better policy and will cost less.”

“To regain the trust of the American people, it’s time we abolish ICE,” he added.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat, New York

Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., was one of three lawmakers who introduced legislation that would abolish the federal immigration agency.

“We are pushing to bring an end to ICE as the agency has strayed too far from its original mission, intent and purpose,” Espaillat said in a statement. “In the era of President Trump, ICE has been granted an unlimited range to terrorize Latino communities around the country, regardless of citizenship or status.

“We are witnessing a human rights crisis, and our bill would bring forward a new model and dismantle ICE once and for all,” he said.

The Democrats who brought the bill forth – which included Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Pramila Jayapal of Washington – ultimately said they would not vote for it, accusing House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, of creating a “political stunt.”

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, Washington

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., told Democracy Now she would “love to see ICE go.”

And in an interview with The Hill, Jayapal said she supports calls “to take a rogue agency and completely get rid of it and start over,” adding that “nobody’s saying, ‘Don’t have the functions that are necessary for the enforcement of immigration laws.’”

“We need to set up a commission that looks at the alternatives to ICE and really starts to understand how do we have these functions in a way that is accountable, transparent and humane,” she said.

Rep. Jim McGovern, Massachusetts

On his re-election campaign website, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., says “it’s time to abolish ICE.”

“We need to start a fresh conversation. If there are elements that work, we can maintain and strengthen those aspects. Otherwise, we need to thoroughly re-evaluate and re-think immigration enforcement,” he said.

Rep. Mark Pocan, Wisconsin

Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., has done more than just call for eradicating ICE; he’s written legislation that would do just that.

WHAT TRUMP’S ‘ZERO-TOLERANCE’ IMMIGRATION POLICY MEANS FOR CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM FAMILIES AT BORDER

“Unfortunately, the president has created this situation where ICE isn’t doing what it was created to do. It’s being used used as his own personal police force, and in those actions it’s actually making us less safe because the critical functions of ICE can no longer happen when the president has them going after people in churches and workplaces,” Pocan told Fox News. “It’s just been made a mess.”

Rep. Nydia Velazquez, New York

Rep. Nydia Velazquez, who represents New York’s 7th congressional district, said getting rid of ICE would be “an important step.”

“ICE is being used to terrorize immigrant communities and carry out President Trump’s immoral ‘zero-tolerance’ policy,” Velazquez said in a statement. “Moreover, the agency’s almost myopic focus on harassing and targeting immigrants distracts from priorities most Americans actually share – like cracking down on transnational criminals and sex traffickers.”

“At this point, modest reforms at the margins of the agency are insufficient. The time has come to abolish ICE,” she continued.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, echoed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – a young congressional candidate who stunned the political world when she beat longtime incumbent Rep. Joe Crawley in New York’s Democratic primary – in calling for the eradication of ICE. He said while every nation needs a “sensible, transparent immigration regulation” agency, ICE is not that for the U.S.

“ICE’s time has come and gone. It is broken,” de Blasio told WNYC in an interview. “ICE has been sent on a very negative, divisive mission, and it cannot function the way it is. So I think that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is right. We should abolish ICE. We should create something better, something different.”

Gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon, New York

Former “Sex and the City” star Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, has called ICE a “terrorist organization” in calling for it to be dissolved.

“ICE has strayed so far away from its mission. It is supposed to be here to keep Americans safe, but what has turned into, frankly, is a terrorist organization of its own that is terrorizing people who are coming into this country,” Nixon said during an event at a Manhattan church.

‘ABOLISH ICE’ GOES MAINSTREAM AS GILLIBRAND, DE BLASIO BACK CALLS

Previously, she told “The View” that ICE should be abolished because it has “strayed so far from the interests of the American people and the interests of humanity.” She said it wouldn’t need to be replaced with anything else.

Already in the primary, Nixon has been credited with pushing Cuomo to the left on some issues. Cuomo has said he doesn’t support abolishing ICE.

Congressional candidate Randy Bryce, Wisconsin

A Democrat running for outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan’s congressional seat in Wisconsin, Randy Bryce called for the abolishment of ICE.

Bryce accused ICE of having “grown power hungry, sucking up more and more federal resources and directing them towards the deportation of children and families, who are otherwise completely law-abiding,” on his campaign website.

WOMAN ESCORTED DOWN AFTER SCALING STATUE OF LIBERTY FOLLOWING ANTI-ICE PROTESTS

“Accordingly, Randy believes that ICE should be abolished, and Congress should explore which existing agency could best house immigration and customs enforcement, so that only those who pose a true threat to our country’s security face deportation,” his website said.

Congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York

Abolishing ICE is part of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s platform as she runs for Congress in New York. Ocasio-Cortez, who is only 28, beat the incumbent Rep. Joseph Crowley in New York’s Democratic primary in June.

“As overseen by the Trump administration, ICE operates with virtually no accountability, ripping apart families and holding our friends and neighbors indefinitely in inhumane detention centers scattered across the United States,” Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign website states. “Alex believes that if we are to uphold civic justice, we must abolish ICE and see to it that our undocumented neighbors are treated with the dignity and respect owed to all people, regardless of citizenship status.”

According to the liberal Mother Jones magazine, Ocasio-Cortez was one of the first congressional candidates in 2018 who called for the eradication of ICE.

"The landscape of presidential nominee coverage is littered with examples of picks who withered under political and media scrutiny, like Harriet Miers under George W. Bush or Tom Daschle under Barack Obama.

Yet a string of would-be media hits on President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, have fizzled on impact -- doing little to dent his image and, in some cases, backfiring on the news outlets that published them.

This includes articles 'exposing' how he spent big bucks on baseball games and, most recently, a detailed New Yorker analysis of his college sports reporting three decades ago -- which quotes one academic, somehow, asserting that Kavanaugh's college basketball articles show he would endorse ""unlimited Presidential power"" under Trump.

To conservatives, the stories speak to a still-struggling effort to ""smear"" an otherwise qualified nominee.

“Going forward, this sad smear campaign sets a troubling precedent for future nominees regardless of who the president is,” conservative strategist Chris Barron said.

The New York Times added to the list when it published a recent story on how internal emails show Kavanaugh ""helped the [Bush] administration’s effort to win Senate confirmation for one of Mr. Bush’s most disputed judicial nominees,"" despite testifying in 2006 that nominee Charles W. Pickering Sr. ""was not one of the judicial nominees that I was primarily handling.""

The piece reflected Democratic questions of whether Kavanaugh had misled the Senate.

However, National Review's David French contacted Pickering, who said the Times did not try to contact him before its report and, further, he didn't remember interacting with Kavanaugh even once during his confirmation fight.

He said in a statement: “While I worked with attorneys in the White House Counsel’s office, I cannot recall a single interaction with Brett Kavanaugh about my judicial nomination. I do not even remember knowing his name at the time. His 2006 testimony is accurate.”

The Daily Wire published a story mocking the Times for the report, writing sarcastically that “they really” got Kavanaugh this time.

“Combine this with his purchase of baseball tickets and love of beer and they might just take this guy down,” the column said.

This was a reference to some other recent hits on Kavanaugh that left barely a scuff.

Last month, The Washington Post was mocked for a report that Kavanaugh racked up credit card debt on Washington Nationals baseball tickets -- even though he paid off the bill. The paper homed in on Kavanaugh incurring “tens of thousands of dollars of credit card debt buying baseball tickets over the past decade” and waited until the fourth paragraph to mention that he paid the bill.

ProPublica then took things a step further last week, soliciting readers to help figure out who attended the games with a headline, “Did You Go to a Washington Nationals Game With Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh?” The bizarre post has the subhead, “Trump’s pick is a baseball fan who racked up considerable debt buying season tickets. Help us figure out who went with the nominated judge.”

“Hope, it seems, springs eternal in a newsroom with a political agenda,” National Review’s Thomas Jipping wrote in reaction to the ProPublica’s piece.

NewsBusters Managing Editor Curtis Houck told Fox News that ProPublica’s piece “should go in the dictionary under what a ‘fishing expedition’ looks like.”

Then there's The New Yorker's newly published deep dive on college sports articles Kavanaugh wrote for the Yale Daily News in the mid-1980s -- searching for clues ""to how he might rule on critical issues.”

The article asks, ""Could there be hints of potential Supreme Court rulings under headlines like ‘Elis Trounce Jaspers’ and ‘Hoopsters Head West?’"" The prestigious magazine brought in “experts,” including a veteran Sports Illustrated writer and a professors from Northwestern, Harvard and Yale to explain that his sports articles from three decades ago could foreshadow his position on Supreme Court decisions.

One example was that every college hoops player was described as either “blazing or ice-cold,” which the Sports Illustrated writer said could indicate “a kind of good-evil, hot-cold, Manichean world view.”

“His tendency to approach his stories from the angles set forth by the coach indicates that he doesn’t want to buck authority figures … It would make sense if he supported unlimited Presidential power,” Northwestern’s J. A. Adande also told the magazine.

Further, Harvard Law professor and Obama mentor Laurence Tribe seized on a Kavanaugh description of how a single basketball player can “completely dominate a game.”

Tribe opined in the piece: “Kavanaugh’s seeming fascination with single-player domination might be a muscular view of executive power.”

The Washington Post in July also published a feature on the “elite” world of Kavanaugh. In addition to tales of attending an expensive prep school and living in a nice house, the story noted that Kavanaugh’s neighborhood bartender knew a “a middle-aged guy named Brett who likes to pop in for a Budweiser and a burger” and didn’t have any idea he was a judge.

RedState’s Sarah Rumpf wrote, “Sounds like a very humble, down-to-earth guy,” and suggested the Post’s headline should have been something along the lines of, “SCOTUS nominee so humble he didn’t even tell his favorite bartender he was a lawyer.”

Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing is set to begin after Labor Day.

Democrats are searching through his files for lines of attacks and are sure to dig into his years with the Bush White House, which is how the Pickering controversy arose.

But White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah told the Times that the Democrats were making “increasingly desperate and baseless attacks” when asked about Kavanaugh’s role in Pickering’s nomination. “He met with various lawyers at the White House, but he doesn’t remember meeting or interacting with Kavanaugh even once.”

Kavanaugh's years working for independent counsel Ken Starr are also under the microscope. In the latest article on that era, the Post ran a piece Monday titled, “Brett Kavanaugh memo detailed explicit questions for Clinton.”

The story focused on a 20-year-old memo in which Kavanaugh reportedly opposed giving then-President Bill Clinton a “break” in the Monica Lewinsky investigation. At the time, Kavanaugh reportedly came up with questions for Clinton including, “If Monica Lewinsky says that you inserted a cigar into her vagina while you were in the Oval Office area, would she be lying?”

It's unclear whether this report will damage Kavanaugh either, other than to provide critics fodder to paint the nominee as having a dirty mind or going out of his way to expose a sitting Democratic president for misconduct.",politics
"This Memorial Day weekend, Americans are enjoying the warm weather, cookouts and all sorts of outdoor recreational opportunities as we spend time with family and friends.

Statistics compiled by WalletHub tell us that 60 percent of Americans are eating at barbecues, beer sales will be higher than any day except the Fourth of July, 41.5 million people are traveling, and about 41 percent of us are taking advantage of Memorial Day sales.

Oh, and by the way, more than 200,000 American flags have been placed on graves in a large cemetery facing our nation’s capital, the heart of a holiday that honors the more than 1.3 million Americans who have died in our nation’s wars.

I live in Arlington, Virginia. Many know it as a highly urbanized suburb of Washington – home to federal government workers, lobbyists, defense contractors and a host of other members of the Washington infrastructure.

Yet Arlington County’s dense housing has a major open space, just like New York City’s Manhattan. However unlike Central Park’s use as a place for recreation, Arlington’s open space is Arlington National Cemetery, where the graves of over 400,000 service members, veterans and their relatives are buried in eternal remembrance.

I recently had the chance to stroll again through America’s “most sacred place.” With the rolling hills dotted by seemingly innumerable graves, my heart grew heavy as I walked among them.

The graves hold members of the military who served from the Civil War to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Every rank from the lowest to the highest is represented. Some of those buried in Arlington died young, on active duty. Some died old, decades after leaving the military.

The religious symbols inscribed on the gravestones included the Latin Cross, Star of David, Star and Crescent and more. Some have no religious symbols. The names represent people with origins from all over the planet, reminding us why it is often said that the U.S. military is the world’s most diverse organization.

What all these graves have in common, however, is the reason why those buried there were interned for perpetuity on land previously owned by both the Washington and Lee families before becoming a cemetery in the 1860s. These men and women took an oath to the Constitution and served our country and each other with honor, dignity and courage.

As our nation celebrates Memorial Day on a beautiful weekend, we should take the opportunity as well to reflect on the sacrifice of the members of our armed forces who gave their lives so we can enjoy freedom and prosperity in the greatest human experiment ever known.

We should also take time to reflect on what we can do for those currently serving, the veterans who have returned home, and the future soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines of our republic.

There are worrying signs of the increasing civilian-military divide in America.

Despite the military being by far the most respected institution in our country, recent polling has shown that fewer Americans are serving in the military compared to past generations, and far fewer Americans now even know anyone who has served in the military.

According to Pew Research, in 2016 veterans accounted for only about 7 percent of U.S. adults. In comparison, in 1980 they were 18 percent.

Even among our nation’s leaders a stark change has happened. In 1953 – just eight years after World War II ended – 74 percent of members of the U.S. Senate and 62 percent of members of the House of Representatives were veterans. But last year, only 20 percent of senators and 19 percent of House members were veterans.

Fewer veterans in Congress means there are fewer members who understand from first-hand experience the difficulties that veterans face – both in dealing with the Department of Veterans Affairs on their health-care needs and with other issues connected to their service.

Many of us are familiar with the Department of Veteran Affairs’ scandal, in which veterans were found to not be given their health-care appointments on time and with perhaps as many as 307,000 veterans dying while they awaited health-care appointments, according to a government investigation.

There also is the complex and elusive problem of post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), which affects as many as 31 percent of Vietnam veterans, 11 percent of Afghanistan veterans, and 20 percent of Iraq War veterans. It also is a contributing factor to veteran homelessness and elevated veteran suicide rates, estimated at up to 22 a day.

Even those veterans who return from service with their minds and bodies intact face struggles ranging from a skills gap to civilians not understanding their experience.

This Memorial Day weekend is undoubtedly a joyful time for many millions of Americans across this great nation of ours. However, it is more than worth a moment of our time to reflect on all that has been given so that we can enjoy our entire way of life, as well as what we can do to help those currently alive and serving or who have served.

This is the very least we can do, and it is up to us to now provide that helping hand and warm embrace in return for their sacrifices.",politics

In a city once called the Saudi Arabia of Venezuela for its vast oil wealth, residents of Maracaibo now line up to buy spoiled meat as refrigerators fail amid nine months of rolling power outages that recently got worse.

Some people fall ill eating the rotten beef, but at bargain prices, it's the only way they can afford protein as the country's crisis hits bottom.

""It smells a little foul, but you rinse it with a little vinegar and lemon,"" said Yeudis Luna, a father of three young boys buying darkened cuts at a butcher shop in Venezuela's second largest city.

Venezuelans are enduring the worst economic downfall in the oil-rich country's history. Basic services like running water and electricity have become luxuries.

Socialist President Nicolas Maduro blames the strife on an economic war waged by the United States and other capitalist powers. The governor of Maracaibo's Zulia state, Omar Prieto, recently said the rampant blackouts were being repaired, but relief has yet to come.

The sprawling port city of Maracaibo on the banks of a vast lake once served as a hub of Venezuela's oil production, producing roughly half of the nation's crude that was shipped around the world.

A bridge over Lake Maracaibo stands as a reminder of better times. The eight-kilometer (five-mile) long structure built five decades ago once glowed at night with thousands of lights, linking the city with the rest of Venezuela. Maracaibo was clean and bustling with international restaurants.

Today, the bridge's lights no longer shine and broken down oil platforms span the lake with downwind shores soaked in oil. The once-posh shopping centers have fallen into ruin and the international businesses have packed up and left.

For the last nine months Maracaibo's residents have endured rolling blackouts. Things turned dire Aug. 10 when a fire destroyed a main powerline supplying the city of 1.5 million people.

Refrigeration units fell idle and meat began turning. At least four butcher shops have been selling spoiled meat in Las Pulgas, Maracaibo's central market.

Butcher Johel Prieto said the outage turned an entire side of beef rotten. He ground up much of it and mixed it with a fresh, red meat in an attempt to mask the spoilage.

A pungent tray of the ground meat and other graying cuts on display one day at his counter collected flies — and a steady flow of customers. Some feed it to their dogs, said Prieto, yet others cook it for their families.

""Of course they eat the meat — thanks to Maduro,"" Prieto said. ""The food of the poor is rotten food.""

Across the way in another stall, a butcher — shirtless and smoking a cigarette — offers up trays of blackened cuts.

""People are buying it,"" said Jose Aguirre who was unloading spoiled chicken.

Luna, a 55-year-old parking lot watchman, took a kilogram of cuts home knowing they were bad, but doing what he could to make the meat edible.

His wife last year left for Colombia, abandoning him and their boys aged 6, 9 and 10. He said she couldn't stand the hunger anymore. He hasn't heard from her since.

Preparing the meat, Luna says he first rinsed it with water and then let it soak overnight in vinegar. He squeezed two lemons and let it simmer with a tomato and a half-onion.

Luna and his boys ate it.

""I was afraid that they would get sick because they are small,"" he said. ""But only the little one got diarrhea and threw up.""",world
"From former presidents to professional athletes, those honoring the late Sen. John McCain this week transcend political parties and professions.

McCain was 81 when he died on August 25 following a year-long struggle with brain cancer. He had served in the U.S. Senate since 1987; before that, he served his country in the Navy during the Vietnam War, becoming a prisoner of war for several years.

In a farewell message released after his death, McCain encouraged the country not to “despair of our present difficulties but believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here.”

“Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history,” McCain said.

Read on for a look at who is expected to attend and speak during services for McCain in Arizona and Washington, D.C.

Presidents

Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush are expected to deliver remarks during a Saturday service for McCain in Washington, D.C.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, who said he will miss his friend McCain dearly after his death, will deliver a tribute during the Thursday service in Arizona. Vice President Mike Pence will participate in a Friday service in Washington, D.C.

EVERYTHING TO KNOW ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN’S FUNERAL

Former Vice President Dan Quayle will also attend the Arizona service.

President Trump is not expected to attend any of the services. And former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who served as McCain’s running mate in 2008, was reportedly not invited either.

Lawmakers

A bevy of lawmakers – both Republicans and Democrats – will attend a Thursday memorial service for McCain in Arizona, including fellow Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake.

Others, include: Lamar Alexander, John Barrasso, Michael Bennet, John Boozman, Bill Cassidy, Chris Coons, Bob Corker, John Cornyn, Steve Daines, Kirsten Gillibrand, Heidi Heitkamp, Mazie Hirono, John Hoeven, Joe Manchin, Jeff Merkley, Patty Murray, Jack Reed, Jim Risch, Ben Sasse, Jon Tester, John Thune, Roger Wicker and Todd Young.

JOHN MCCAIN’S POLITICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS

In D.C., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan are expected to deliver remarks in honor of McCain. Along with McConnell, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will present a Senate wreath in McCain’s memory.

Sen. Lindsey Graham and former Sen. Kelly Ayotte will give readings during a service at the National Cathedral Saturday. Former Sen. Joseph Lieberman will also give remarks.

Athletes

Larry Fitzgerald Jr., a venerable wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, is set to give a tribute to McCain at a memorial service in Arizona. He told ESPN he was “taken aback” when he was asked by Cindy McCain to say a few words during the service.

“It’s truly one of the greatest honors of my life to be able to talk about somebody who served his country so passionately and had been so dedicated to policies of this nation,” Fitzgerald said.

Former Arizona Coyotes player Shane Doan and Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder Luis Gonzalez will serve as pallbearers at the funeral, Fox News previously reported.

McCain was an avid supporter of Arizona sports teams and often seen at sporting events. He even worked to keep the Arizona Coyotes in the area after the former team owner filed for bankruptcy. The Coyotes honored McCain with a bobblehead at a military appreciation night in 2011 and the senator dropped the ceremonial first puck before the game against the Montreal Canadiens.

Pallbearers

The pallbearers for McCain’s service in Arizona are: Freeport-McMoRan Inc. CEO Richard Adkerson, Swift Transportation Vice President David Berry, Betts Real Estate Advisors President Steven Betts, political advisor Charles Black, Pinnacle West and Arizona Public Service President Don Brandt, Hensley Beverage Company CEO Robert Delgado, Dr. Oliver Harper, Explorador Capital Management partner Joseph Harper, Judge Diane Humetewa, former World Shipping Council President Chris Koch, Scottsdale Community Bank Chairman George Weisz and Capital Research Global Investors Director Greg Wendt.

A LOOK AT JOHN MCCAIN’S MILITARY CAREER

Retired MLB player Luis Gonzalez and retired NHL player Shane Doan will also serve as pallbearers.

For the National Cathedral service in Washington, D.C., the pallbearers will be: former Vice President Joe Biden, actor Warren Beatty, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Defense Secretary William Cohen, former Sen. Gary Hart, businessman Stephen Dart, former McCain presidential campaign manager Richard Davis, fundraiser Carla Eudy, former Sen. Russ Feingold, former Sen. Phil Gramm, Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, former Gov. Tom Ridge, former McCain chief of staff Mark Salter, FedEx founder Fred Smith and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse.

"Mayor de Blasio is a such a big believer in the free press that he let two bodyguards physically remove a credentialed Post reporter who had the temerity to ask him a question in public on Sunday.

The unusual muzzling unfolded at the start of the annual Dominican Day Parade in Manhattan, where the reporter sought de Blasio’s reaction to The Post’s front page story about his administration’s many meetings with lobbyists.

It also came after Hizzoner appeared on national TV Sunday to proclaim, “I believe in a free, strong media with diverse views — I’ll defend it with all I’ve got.”

Just two hours later, after de Blasio cut a ribbon to kick off the parade and was posing for photos near West 37th Street and Sixth Avenue, the reporter asked him to comment on the “CITY FOR SALE” Page One story.

Instead of answering or even declining to answer the question, the mayor watched as two members of his NYPD security detail approached the reporter — who was wearing a police-issued press pass around his neck — with one grabbing his shoulder and leading him away from the mayor.

“Kevin, you have to leave. You can’t be here,” the plainclothes cop said.

Both bodyguards then escorted the reporter about a half-block away, where a member of the NYPD’s public-information office, Officer Brian Magoolaghan, told him, “Come on, Kevin. No stunts today.”

City Hall had previously declined to discuss records that showed officials held 136 meetings with lobbyists during just three months earlier this year.

The incident was reminiscent of one last month when the White House barred a CNN reporter from a Rose Garden event for shouting “inappropriate” questions at President Trump in the Oval Office earlier in the day.

De Blasio’s press secretary referred questions about the incident at the parade to the NYPD, which said in an email: “The Department takes appropriate and necessary measures to protect dignitaries, including the Mayor of the City of New York.”

"Most Americans are sick and tired of the leaky, slow-motion drama that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s so-called “Russia collusion” investigation has become.

Mueller has mounted an all-out effort, funded by your tax dollars, to find something – anything – that he can use to accuse President Trump of illegal conduct. The goal is clear: getting the president either convicted on criminal charges (if such a thing is even possible for a president) or impeached and removed from office.

This may be as close to a coup as we’ve ever come in the United States. Unhappy with the 2016 election results – attributable to Americans who Hillary Clinton called a “basket of deplorables” – President Trump’s opponents are now arrayed against him and want him out of the Oval Office.

The precedent being set by these post-election machinations is constitutionally damaging, and genuinely deplorable. Investigations of future presidents by their political opponents, as a means to force them from office, may become the norm.

Tying up any president – Democrat or Republican – in investigation after investigation after unwieldy, God-forsaken investigation would make it almost impossible for someone to effectively carry out the demanding job.

U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis hammered the point home Friday, addressing prosecutors working for Mueller at a hearing in Virginia on financial fraud charges against former Trump presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort.

""You don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud,"" Ellis told the prosecutors. “You really care about getting information that Mr. Manafort can give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump and lead to his prosecution or impeachment or whatever.”

Then the judge opened up the throttle. ""We don't want anyone in this country with unfettered power,” he said, and “it's unlikely you're going to persuade me the special prosecutor has power to do anything he or she wants,"" since ""the American people feel pretty strongly that no one has unfettered power.""

Right he is! Already, the special counsel’s anti-Trump crusade has imposed incalculable costs on our country – creating distrust and disunity, unnecessary stress, emotional and mental fatigue, millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and rolling ill-will.

Let’s remember one thing: The American people elected Donald Trump because we wanted him to tackle the nation’s serious problems – not be forced to devote endless time to an investigation that’s more debacle than disclosure, waste than haste, and increasingly arrogant.

Whatever the original intent, the Mueller investigation has begun to consume people, eroding bonds that make us one. That is why it has to wrap up.

Now, on top of everything else, we face a constitutional crisis, as the Department of Justice challenges long-established congressional oversight authority.

To what end? To preserve a clutch of second-tier convictions? For that, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is gambling America’s institutional trust and longstanding inter-branch relationships.

Members of Congress recently requested documents from Rosenstein, including the full “scope memo” explaining exactly what the Mueller probe was assigned to investigate. That’s a reasonable request, since there’s a great deal of confusion surrounding the Mueller investigation’s scope, duration, motives, authorities, personnel and selective focus.

Congress wants to understand – as do many Americans – whether Mueller’s wide-ranging investigation has gone beyond its scope, and when the investigation nightmare will end.

But Rosenstein refused to produce the scope memo without redactions, arguing that it pertains to an ongoing criminal investigation. This is a weak excuse, given the flood of recent leaks about the Mueller probe.

Congress’ constitutional oversight authority is supported by six express constitutional clauses and 18 separate laws – as well as Congress’s historic power to subpoena, grant immunity, take testimony, hold executive officers in contempt, and impeach.

So Rosenstein is on shaky ground in telling Congress that it has no right to see what it needs to exercise oversight.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who is chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said earlier this week: ""Valid investigative requests from Congress have been slow-walked, stonewalled, and impeded at each step of the way under his (Rosenstein’s) watch."" That should not happen.

In response to Rosenstein’s refusal to produce key documents, some House members have prepared articles of impeachment against him as a last resort. They want accountability. They are right to want it.

Maybe Rosenstein just wants to be left alone – or to give Mueller more time for rummaging around for something on the president. Perhaps Rosenstein is allied with forces that want to avoid further congressional scrutiny.

Either way, Rosenstein said Tuesday: ""I can tell you there are people who have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time and I think they should understand by now: The Department of Justice is not going to be extorted.""

Extorted? By members of Congress? Men and women elected by the American people to seek truth and assure accountability? What a curious, inapt and constitutionally disparaging reference by Rosenstein – a man trained in careful use of words like “extorted.”

Aiming to put himself in the right, Rosenstein added: ""We’re going to do what is required by the rule of law and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job.""

Someone needs to slow this train down, or turn the burner back to simmer. No personal threats are contained in congressional insistence that executive branch officials comply with constitutional oversight. That is what the law requires. Refusing to comply doesn’t uphold the law – it ignores the law.

In fact, the Justice Department has often been forced to disgorge documents to Congress that compromise cases. Whether Rosenstein likes it or not, that is the law. He is not exempt from legitimate congressional oversight, which can at times impinge on individual cases.

Constitutional oversight is paramount. In a head-to-head battle over what is produced, Congress always wins. Absent executive privilege, the deputy attorney general cannot bar Congress from the documents it seeks.

I was a principal counsel in the Waco investigation by Congress in 1995, which examined a disastrous siege by federal law enforcement officers against members of an armed religious cult in Waco, Texas. Some 86 people died – including four federal agents.

The committee I served compelled the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; Immigration and Naturalization Service; and Justice Department to provide us with hundreds of thousands of documents that later resulted in criminal referrals.

Like today, tricks were played by political actors at the Justice Department. Our committee was stiff-armed, slow-rolled and flayed in the media. Documents were over-redacted, under-produced, and dumped on the eve of hearings, hiding critical things in a massive pile of nothing important.

But we got them. Such shameless legal games, in that day, distressed average Americans. They still do. These antics do a disservice to the pursuit of truth, disaffect regular people, and create unnecessary suspicion and distrust around institutions that work on trust.

Complying with lawful congressional oversight is central to upholding rule of law in a democracy. Obstructing Congress should not be a policy for any department, especially not the Justice Department.

No wonder that President Trump tweeted, in response to Rosenstein’s obstruction: “A Rigged System - They don’t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal ‘justice?’ At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!”

President Trump would be within his rights to “get involved.” Ironically, presidents have been criticized in the past for not providing information to Congress. But no modern president has been harangued by the opposition party for saying a department should provide Congress with material sought pursuant to constitutional oversight.

Here’s the bottom line: Rosenstein has a responsibility – indeed, a duty – to give Congress the full “scope memo” explaining what Mueller is investigating and other information Congress needs to carry out its oversight responsibilities. America has a right to know.

And Mueller and his team have a responsibility to wrap up their investigation, so President Trump and his administration can get on with the important work he was elected to do.

To borrow a phrase from failed Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont: “Enough is enough!”

At a certain point, words run out, and action is required.",politics
"New York City Housing Authority officials suspended two employees tied to alleged on-the-clock sex parties at a Bronx housing project, sources tell The Post.

The two have been sent home without pay for 30 days as the embattled authority investigates charges that employees at the Throggs Neck Houses boozed and got busy in the NYCHA complex.

It’s the strongest punishment the authority can levy before the investigation is complete, sources added.

Word of the suspensions comes just hours after The Post exposed that officials at the authority had not yet taken any disciplinary action against the employees allegedly involved.

The Housing Authority first found out about the salacious allegations in May and immediately began investigating, the sources said.

The Department of Investigation also got wind of the accusations early this month and forwarded them to NYCHA officials on Aug. 15. NYCHA officials say they have kept DOI apprised of their investigation.

"A man accused of trying to assassinate British Prime Minister Theresa May in a failed terrorist plot was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison.

Naa’imur Zakariyah Rahman, 21, from north London, was convicted last month of planning to bomb the entry gates to the prime minister’s residence at 10 Downing Street and then attack May with a knife or gun when she emerged.

He was arrested in November after collecting a backpack he believed was stuffed with explosives. He thought he was getting the explosives from ISIS adherents, according to officials, but had actually been talking to undercover police.

“I want to do a suicide bomb on parliament,” Rahman reportedly told the undercover cop, Sky News reported. “I want to attempt to kill Theresa May.”

“[God willing] will be very big if I’m successful. I can’t get [martyrdom] if I get caught,” he reportedly told the cop.

Police said they began investigating Rahman when he was arrested on suspicion of sending indecent images to underage girls in August last year. They said there was concern about potentially extremist views after examining his cellphone, Sky News reported.

Rahman’s uncle – who had travelled to Syria and was killed in a drone attack last June – reportedly was the one who encouraged him to take action against May.

Judge Charles Haddon-Cave sentenced Rahman Friday to life with no chance of parole for 30 years. The judge said Rahman was ""a very dangerous individual"" and it was hard to predict whether he would ever be de-radicalized.

Rahman's alleged accomplice, Mohammed Aqib Imran, who is accused of trying to join the Islamic State group but was not charged in the assassination plot, has pleaded not guilty.

"FBI and Justice Department officials on Thursday will brief the bipartisan group of lawmakers known as the ""Gang of 8"" on classified documents related to the special counsel's Russia investigation -- after they meet with two key House Republican lawmakers, Fox News has learned.

The first meeting at Justice Department headquarters is scheduled to take place at noon and will include White House Chief of Staff John Kelly; Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein; FBI Director Christopher Wray; Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats; House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif.; and House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.

The second meeting, scheduled for 2 p.m., will include Kelly, Rosenstein, Wray, Coats, Gowdy, Republican and Democratic leaders from both the House and Senate, and the top lawmakers from their intelligence panels.

Both House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told Fox News they plan to attend the second meeting. Warner is vice chairman of the Senate intelligence panel.

The announcement of a second meeting came after criticism from Democrats who said the briefing should have been given to the ""Gang of 8"" -- as opposed to just Nunes and Gowdy.

Nunes, an ardent Trump supporter, has been demanding information on an FBI source in the Russia investigation. The president himself took up the cause over the weekend, demanding on Twitter that the Justice Department investigate whether the FBI infiltrated his presidential campaign. Late Sunday, the DOJ asked its watchdog to investigate whether there was inappropriate surveillance.

""If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action,"" Rosenstein said in a statement announcing the move.

In initially announcing the Nunes-Gowdy meeting Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said no Democrats had been invited because they had not requested the information.

White House spokesman Raj Shah initially told Fox News that a separate meeting between the ""Gang of 8"" and Justice Department, law enforcement and intelligence officials would take place after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess.

However, Shah said in an updated statement late Wednesday that the White House was ""working"" to schedule a ""Gang of 8"" briefing before the recess.

In another twist, three Republican senators -- Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; and John Cornyn of Texas -- sent a letter to Rosenstein and Kelly Tuesday expressing interest in attending the meeting.

""I want to find out what's going on,"" Graham said Wednesday. "" ... I don't think we've ever had a circumstance like this where during the campaign the FBI felt like they had to apparently, I don't know whether it’s true or not, have a confidential informant engage in a campaign so somebody needs to figure out if you do this again, how you do it or if you do it all.""

For his part, Gowdy told Fox News Wednesday that ""I don't care who comes"" to the meeting.

""The only thing I'd ask, if you show up, show up with an open mind and closed lips,"" Gowdy told Fox News' ""The Daily Briefing."" ""In other words don't leak like a sieve when we get through with the meeting ... But it's not my meeting and I don't publish the invite list.""

"At least one additional government ""informant"" attempted to infiltrate the Trump campaign under President Barack Obama, former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo revealed exclusively on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" Monday night.

""Let me tell you something that I know for a fact,"" Caputo told host Laura Ingraham. ""This informant, this person that they tried to plant into the campaign -- and even into the administration, if you believe Axios -- he's not the only person who came at the campaign. And the FBI is not the only Obama agency who came at the campaign.

""I know because they came at me,"" Caputo added. ""And I'm looking for clearance from my attorney to reveal this to the public. This is just the beginning.""

Axios has reported that the suspected FBI informant in the Trump campaign was recommended for a senior post in the Trump administration.

""When we finally find out the truth about this, Director Clapper and the rest of them will be wearing some orange suits,"" Caputo told Ingraham, referring to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

""This is just the beginning."" - Former Trump aide Michael Caputo

The ""informant"" approached several Trump campaign officials in 2016, including Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, according to multiple reports.

The New York Times reported that the ""informant"" approached Papadopoulos with an offer of money to write an academic paper about energy in the eastern Mediterranean region. Over drinks one evening at a high-end London hotel, he asked Papadopoulos if he knew anything about Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election, the paper reported.

According to The Times, Papadopoulos replied he had no insight into the Russian campaign, despite being told months earlier that the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of her emails.

Trump said Sunday he’d formally seek a Department of Justice probe into whether government agents surveilled the campaign for political purposes, and whether any such demands came from the Obama administration.

""Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president,"" Trump tweeted Friday. ""It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a 'hot' Fake News story. If true - all time biggest political scandal!""

The DOJ soon afterward assigned its internal watchdog to review those claims.

Trump also met Monday afternoon with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray. Out of that meeting, the White House announced that top DOJ officials would meet with congressional leaders about classified information they’d been seeking in connection with the Russia case.",politics

"Incumbent Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer conceded to his opponent, Secretary of State Kris Kobach, in the state’s Republican primary Tuesday night, one week after the extremely narrow vote.

The latest vote tally put Kobach, whom President Trump had endorsed, just 345 votes over Colyer out of more than 311,000 initially counted.

Kobach took to Twitter to thank the governor for his endorsement and his “gracious call” to concede.

The close race called for a lengthy county-by-county review of provisional ballots and resulted in both candidates’ challenging each other's legal interpretations, sending observers to monitor the vote count and raising the specter of lawsuits.

Colyer also questioned whether Kobach — the top election official in Kansas as secretary of state — was advising counties not to count some mail-in ballots, including those with missing or unreadable postmarks.

Kobach removed himself from election-related duties on Aug. 10 until the primary outcome was resolved, but Colyer argued that Kobach still had a conflict of interest because his top deputy took over Kobach's responsibilities.

Kobach rejected Colyer's criticisms, saying his ""unrestrained rhetoric has the potential to undermine the public's confidence in the election process.""

Trump endorsed Kobach in a tweet the day before the primary: ""Kris Kobach, a strong and early supporter of mine, is running for Governor of the Great State of Kansas. He is a fantastic guy who loves his State and our Country - he will be a GREAT Governor and has my full & total Endorsement! Strong on Crime, Border & Military.""

Kobach is expected to face Democrat Laura Kelly and independent candidate Greg Orman in the November general election in the decidedly conservative state.

Colyer is a 58-year-old plastic surgeon from suburban Kansas City. He served as lieutenant governor for seven years and took over as governor in January after Sam Brownback resigned to become ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom.

"New York Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez portrays herself as ""a normal, working person,"" but one of her positions may have helped 150 people lose their jobs.

After enduring mockery for declaring Sunday that a walk in a national park was an example of democratic socialism, Ocasio-Cortez lamented Monday the shutting down of an iconic New York coffee shop that closed mostly due to a higher minimum wage – which Ocasio-Cortez supported.

“The restaurant I used to work at is closing its doors. I swung by today to say hi one last time, and kid around with friends like old times,” the congressional candidate reminisced on Twitter. “I’m a normal, working person who chose to run for office, because I believe we can have a better future.”

The Coffee Shop in Union Square, which became especially famous after regularly appearing on HBO’s “Sex and the City,” will close down this fall after nearly 28 years in business. Co-owner and President Charles Milite announced the decision to shut the doors to its 150 employees last month.

But unlike what Ocasio-Cortez wants you to believe about the closing down, it wasn’t the result of greedy capitalists trying to squeeze the workers, but rather government regulations that forced the company to go bust.

“The times have changed in our industry,” Milite told the New York Post last month. “The rents are very high and now the minimum wage is going up and we have a huge number of employees.”

SOCIALIST CANDIDATE OCASIO-CORTEZ ONCE SAW HERSELF AS SMITHIAN CAPITALIST, VIEWEED FAMINISM AS ‘RELIC’

Ocasio-Cortez, who rose to prominence after defeating top Democrat Joe Crowley in the party’s primary election in June, has campaigned on the issue of minimum wage, arguing for a $15 federal minimum wage, up from $7.25, insisting that it won’t have any negative consequences for businesses.

During her appearance on “The Daily Show” with Trevor Noah, Ocasio-Cortez was pressed whether her suggestion of $15 minimum wage wouldn’t tank the economy. She cited the example of Seattle, which voted four years ago to gradually increase the hourly minimum to $15 over several years.

Yet Seattle is a troubling case, as research from the University of Washington's School of Public Policy and Governance found that the higher minimum wage led to significant job declines and actually left the poorest worst off in the city, the Washington Post reported.

The study estimated that low-wage jobs in the city dropped by 9 percent since 2016 and “hourly wages in such jobs increased by around 3 percent.” As a result, the study said, the city’s average worker lost $125 a month thanks to the minimum wage hike.",politics
"A Republican lawmaker is demanding some answers from the FBI after he says the bureau admitted to working with the controversial Southern Poverty Law Center.



In a letter obtained by Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., says the FBI has “admitted to working with the SPLC,” in a development he describes as “surprising and worrisome.”



“This is surprising and worrisome, as the SPLC is known to use its platform in order to denigrate and disparage certain groups by labeling them ‘hate groups,’” he said.



He said that groups such as the Christian Family Research Council (FRC) have been labeled a hate group, while members of “Antifa” -- a broad collaboration of left-leaning, anti-fascist activists -- have not been given such a label. He added that Floyd Corkins, who shot an FRC employee, later said he targeted the group as the SPLC had labeled it an antigay group.



“The SPLC’s conflation of mainstream political advocacy groups with legitimate hate groups and domestic terror groups is absurd, frequently indiscriminate and dangerous,” he said.



While details on the alleged relationship were not clear, “Tucker Carlson Tonight” reported that the FBI had described the group as “a well-known, established and credible” organization in 2009, and that the agency has briefed the FBI on alleged domestic terror threats in the U.S.



Gaetz’s letter requests more information on the FBI’s alleged ties to the group, including how much weight the FBI gives to SPLC designations of “hate groups” and what information, if any, the bureau provides to the group.

The FBI confirmed to “Tucker Carlson Tonight” in June that it “continues to have a relationship with the SPLC.”

This week, when pressed on that relationship, the FBI had this to say: “For many years, the FBI has engaged with various organizations, both formally and informally. Such outreach is a critical component of the FBI’s mission, and we welcome information from these organizations on any possible violations of civil rights, hate crimes or other potential crimes or threats. We do, however, evaluate our relationships with these groups as necessary to ensure the appropriateness of any interaction.”

A Department of Justice spokesman said that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had ordered that any such relationships be re-evaluated.



""The attorney general has directed the FBI to re-evaluate their relationships with groups like this to ensure the FBI does not partner with any group that discriminates,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.

The center recently apologized and issued a $3.3 million settlement to Maajid Nawaz and his organization, the Quilliam Foundation, for including them in a list of “anti-Muslim extremists.”



“Although we may have our differences with some of the positions that Mr. Nawaz and Quilliam have taken, we recognize that they have made important contributions to efforts to promote pluralism and that they are most certainly not anti-Muslim extremists,” the group said in a statement.

"The surge of Central Americans crossing into the U.S. claiming asylum is no secret around the world. Just a snapshot of those caught entering on any given day is stunning – Nigeria, Romania, Nepal – in addition to the hundreds of Mexicans, Guatemalans and Hondurans.

But one of the fastest-growing groups of illegal immigrants come not from the barrios of South America or the slums of Africa, but mega-sized cities in India – 8,000 miles away from the tiny town of El Centro, California, where a handful of Indian nationals are illegally entering the U.S. every day, officials say.

""It's a common misconception that we just arrest Mexicans - that couldn't be further from the truth,"" said El Centro agent Justin Casterhone. ""We arrest people from all over the world.""

Unable to obtain H1b visas, which are given to highly skilled workers, because of a crackdown on the visas by the Trump administration, and because of a fear that Sikhs are coming under attack by fundamentalist groups in their country, Indians are heading to the U.S. -- illegally -- in droves.

In 2015, agents caught six immigrants from India trying to cross into the U.S. from Mexico. So far this fiscal year, the figure is already at more than 3,400.

The U.S.-Mexican border is divided into nine sectors. The smallest is El Centro, a tiny 70-mile stretch just west of the Arizona-California border. That area has become a conduit for those from India fleeing their country.

""Communication is very, very hard,"" said Casterhone, who like most border agents speaks fluent Spanish, but no Punjabi, the native language. ""When trying to communicate, we are gonna have to get the interpreter to get the entire story.""

Agents said they arrest roughly five to 10 Indian nationals a day, with most young men claiming asylum as victims of political or religious persecution. Women, who often belong to a lower class in India's stratified caste system, claim abuse or fear of retribution from families in a higher social class.

""When someone marries beneath their caste, or above their caste, the parents generally get really angry about it and can subject the couple to honor killing,"" said immigration attorney Judith Wood, who has represented and won a number of asylum claims on behalf of Indian nationals.""

Unlike those coming from Central America, who generally flee poverty and seek protection from gangs, most Indians claim persecution based on politics, social group and religion.

“People who are untouchables, the lowest caste, are basically not allowed to participate fully in society,"" Wood said. ""Among members of the Sikh religion, there's a high incidence of torture.""

Most Central Americans pay an $8,000 smuggling fee to cross through Mexico to the U.S. For Indians, it is considerably more.

El Centro Apprehensions 2008-2018 2008 Mexicans 40,159 Indians 0 2009 Mexicans 32,602 Indians 6 2010 Mexicans 31,704 Indians 11 2011 Mexicans 29,474 Indians 9 2012 Mexicans 22,511 Indians 9 2013 Mexicans 15,141 Indians 13 2014 Mexicans 12,511 Indians 32 2015 Mexicans 11,320 Indians 6 2016 Mexicans 14,361 Indians 1,455 2017 Mexicans 12,821 Indians 2,028 2018 Mexicans 15,885 Indians 3,408

""Some of these organizations are charging Indian nationals up to $25,000 dollars to get smuggled into the U.S.,"" said El Centro Sector Chief Gloria Chavez. ""These traffickers, they are winning on this. Law enforcement is not.""

Chavez said Indians generally fly to Qatar then Ecuador, then travel on foot or by bus through the jungles of Colombia and Panama, through Central America and Mexico to El Centro. Most know to travel without any documents verifying their identity.

""Many use their lack of identification to claim to be one person in Mexico and another one in the United States,"" she said. ""In Mexico, they claim to be an adult because unaccompanied minors under 18 are arrested. In the U.S., the opposite is true. Here, they claim to be juveniles so they must be released.""

Asylum seekers without a criminal history in the U.S. are typically released. The Indian nationals usually head to the local Sikh Temple for a meal, change of clothes and a bus ticket. From there they will go live with relatives until an immigration judge can hear their case – typically a year or two later.

""They have the right to migrate wherever they want to go,"" Chavez said. ""But there is a legal way and an illegal way. We want them to do it the legal way.""",world
"Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who was removed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation after sending several anti-Trump text messages during the 2016 presidential election, will voluntarily appear before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.

Reports emerged over the weekend that Strzok was willing to testify before Congress without an immunity deal, and that he would not invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.

Despite his purported willingness, the agent was subpoenaed Sunday to appear on Capitol Hill Wednesday at 10 a.m. because he would not agree to a specific date.

Fox News learned Tuesday that the subpoena was no longer valid because Strzok voluntarily agree to appear for a closed-door interview.

Sources on the Hill told Fox News that the force of a subpoena was not necessary and that the committee plans to bring Strzok back in the near future for public testimony, something the president said was necessary.

President Trump took to Twitter Monday night to blast Strzok, arguing that the hearing should be televised.

“The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI & DOJ should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency,” the president tweeted.

Strzok was removed from Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections after it was revealed that he'd sent several anti-Trump text messages to former FBI colleague and lover Lisa Page during the presidential campaign.

A report last month by the Justice Department's inspector general detailed texts between the pair.

In a text from Strzok to Page dated Aug. 15, 2016, the pair discussed “an insurance policy” in the event that Trump went on to win the presidential election.

“I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office – that there’s no way he gets elected – but I’m afraid we can’t take the risk. It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40,” the text read.

Page also text Strzok that month saying that Trump was ""not ever going to become president, right? Right?!""

""No. No he won't. We'll stop it,"" Strzok responded.

"U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., remained mute about her 2020 ambitions Thursday during a town hall meeting in her home state, but attacked the Trump administration’s immigration policies as “immoral” and said she supports a ban on “weapons of war.”

“This administration, as far as I’m concerned, has put a target on California’s back and we’re going to need to fight this,” Harris told a crowd of more than 1,000 people in the San Fernando Valley, many of whom were young students, the Los Angeles Daily News reported.

“This administration, as far as I’m concerned, has put a target on California’s back and we’re going to need to fight this.” - U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

She criticized the administration's zero-tolerance policy on illegal immigration, which has led to at least 1,300 children being separated from parents who attempted to cross the border illegally.

“It’s immoral,” she said. “And let’s be clear, government should be in the business of keeping families together, not tearing them apart.”

Harris received praise from progressives after her heated confrontation with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen last month, in which she took the Trump administration official to task over the issue.

But Nielsen denied the administration is intentionally splitting the families, explaining to Harris that parents who attempted to enter the country illegally may lose their children if they face charges or jail time, as according to the existing U.S. laws that precede the election of Trump.

Harris, California's junior U.S. senator, isn’t facing re-election this year, but her town hall was held just days before Tuesday’s primary election in the state -- which Democrats hope will help solidify their domination in California and eventually flip seats in the U.S. Congress.

But holding a town hall while not facing an election merely fueled speculation that Harris may run for president in 2020. Rather than dismiss the rumors about it, Harris told reporters that she had “no announcements to make.”

During the event, Harris outlined some of her policy wishes, including banning “weapons of war” and introducing mandatory background checks.

“It’s a false choice to suggest you either support the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away,” she told the audience. “That is ridiculous.”

Harris wrapped up her appearance by saying that although Trump poses challenges to people, she doesn’t believe the country is divided.

“I reject that premise. I do not believe we are divided. I believe that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, and I know that to be true,” she said.

“Under Sadiq Khan, we have seen crime skyrocket to unprecedented levels. People in London don't feel safe and they aren't safe, 81 murders this year alone! Khan Out,” a message on the crowdfunding page read.

More than 80 suspected murders have occurred in the city this year, Sky News reported.

The balloon’s design poked fun at Khan’s decision to ban an advertisement showing a woman wearing a yellow bikini with the message reading, “Are you beach body ready?”

""In light of the Donald Trump 'Baby Trump' balloon being allowed to fly over London during his visit to the UK, let's get a 'baby Khan' one and see if free speech applies to all,” a message on the website stated.

"President Trump likened the growing U.S. economy to a “fine-tuned machine” and again took aim at China over its unfair trading practices Tuesday night at a dinner with prominent business leaders at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.

Trump praised the 4.1 percent economic growth last quarter, attributing it to stronger hiring and tax reform under his administration.

“More Americans are now employed than any time in the recorded history of our country … manufacturing and employment are growing at the fastest rate in more than 30 years and it's going to get even faster,” he said to Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and FedEx CEO Fred Smith, among other business leaders in attendance.

Trump said in addition to cutting regulations, he also “signed the biggest tax cut and reform in the history of our country.”

The president also spoke to the rising tensions between the U.S. and China over its trading practices.

“We’re in a little bit of a fight with China right now,” he said. “They have not treated us fairly for many decades which is the president’s fault. I take responsibility for my time and I couldn’t let that happen.”

TRUMP ASKS TRADE REP TO CONSIDER BOOSTING TARIFFS ON CHINESE IMPORTS FROM 10 PERCENT TO 25

The administration previously imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 6 over similar concerns that Beijing was stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology. China responded by slapping its own penalties on U.S. goods.

"Two of Sen. John McCain’s closest friends on Sunday defended his daughter’s apparent swipes at President Trump during her eulogy at the late Arizona senator’s funeral.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman both argued that Meghan McCain was grieving when making the eulogy for her father and that – just like the late senator himself – his daughter does not back down when criticized.

“If you say something bad about Meghan’s father, you will know it,” Graham said during an appearance Sunday morning on “Fox News Sunday.” “It’s okay because she is grieving.”

Lieberman, who was once tapped to be on McCain’s presidential ticket despite being an Independent who caucused with the Democrats, said that Meghan's father would have been proud of her “direct” manner of speaking and added that she did a “magnificent” job.

“By the nature of his life, she is called on to make a very public, global statement,” Lieberman said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “She did it magnificently, the way her dad would want.”

Meghan McCain’s eulogy, which included quotes from her father’s favorite book, “For Whom the Bell Tolls” by Ernest Hemingway, and homages to his military service, took aim at the catchphrase made famous by Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign as well as the president’s multiple draft deferments that exempted him from serving in Vietnam.

“We gather to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice, those that live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served,” McCain said.

She added: “The America of John McCain is generous and welcoming and bold. She's resourceful, confident, secure. She meets her responsibilities. She speaks quietly because she's strong. America does not boast because she has no need to. The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.”

McCain’s words continue a long-running feud between her father and the president that began during the presidential campaign.

In 2015, after McCain had said Trump's platform had ""fired up the crazies,"" Trump had mocked McCain's imprisonment in the Vietnam War, saying: ""I like people that weren't captured."" Trump has also fumed about McCain's vote last year to kill off a bill to reform ObamaCare.

Saturday’s funeral service notably did not feature President Trump, but Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were in attendance as was Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. The two Cabinet-level officials accompanied McCain’s wife, Cindy, to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where she laid a wreath.

Trump did not make any public statement on Saturday regarding McCain’s comments, instead spending the day at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia. Throughout the day, the president tweeted gripes about trade talks with Canada and the Justice Department, before making a veiled comeback to McCain’s eulogy.

“MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump tweeted around 7 p.m. ET.

"New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and other Democrats reportedly considered staging a mass walkout during the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, but feared such move would only give ammunition to Republicans.

Politico, citing unnamed sources, reported that during a Labor Day conference call, Democratic senators debated whether to walk out in protest of the Republican opposition to the release of millions of pages of missing Kavanaugh documents.

But the party’s top lawmakers ultimately decided against such a course of action, in part fearing the backlash from a made-for-TV moment that would only help the Republican Party, and impede any chances to stop the nomination of Kavanaugh, the report said.

The consideration of such a drastic move revealed a split between the party’s more liberal wing, who wish to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh by all means necessary, and more senior Democrats, who believe the nomination should be defeated only by following rules and norms.

The Democrats ultimately come to a compromise – a disruptive and chaotic hearing, Politico reported.

Younger Democrats, such as California Sen. Kamala Harris, hijacked Tuesday’s hearing almost as soon as it started and urged the committee to delay the hearing amid protests by liberal activists, some of whom were arrested.

Harris received praise for her defiance of the chamber’s norms. “This was a big step forward, and Kamala Harris showed real leadership by going first in interrupting the hearing. Now we need other Democrats who aren't on the committee to speak up and oppose this nominee, too,” Brian Fallon, director of Demand Justice, an anti-Kavanaugh group, told the outlet.

By not staging a walkout, however, Democrats also allowed themselves to become part of the process and grill Kavanaugh in the upcoming hearings, hoping to mobilize opposition to his candidacy.

“If I thought that there was a way that we could stop the hearings from proceeding, I would participate in that. But the hearings are going to proceed. And therefore, we are there to do our job,” Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, told Politico.

“We considered a lot of different options yesterday. This was the agreed approach,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin. “It really singles this hearing out as something unusual.”

The obstructionist tactics, which will surely boost some lawmakers’ reputations among the increasingly liberal base, may still backfire when it comes to the confirmation of Kavanaugh.

Democrats ultimately need to convince moderate Republicans to vote against Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of the swing votes that could stop the nomination, dismissed Tuesday’s protests as “a lot of drama,” according to the outlet.

Still, Democrats haven’t ruled out a boycott or walkout of Kavanaugh hearings, Politico reported. A group of combative Democrats reportedly met in the office of Durbin to talk about future strategy concerning the Supreme Court nomination.",politics
"Iran's supreme leader has casted doubt on saving the international nuclear deal after U.S. withdrawal earlier this year, saying Wednesday that the government should stop pinning its hopes on Europe to keep the accord alive.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Iran could abandon the nuclear agreement if it does not serve the ""national interests"" of the country, Reuters reported.

“The nuclear deal is a means, not the goal, and if we come to this conclusion that it does not serve our national interests, we can abandon it,” Khamenei was quoted as saying by his official website.

Khamenei added that even as officials from European countries work to salvage the deal after the exit by the U.S., Tehran should “give up hope” for the deal to be saved.

“There is no problem with negotiations and keeping contact with the Europeans, but you should give up hope on them over economic issues or the nuclear deal,"" he was quoted as saying.

The comments came a day after Iranian lawmakers ordered President Hassan Rouhani to answer for his role in the faltering economy amid growing political divisions in the country. Rouhani claimed that newly reimposed U.S. sanctions after Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal would only serve to unify the country.

“I want to assure the Iranian nation that we will not allow the U.S. plot against the Islamic Republic to succeed,” he told parliament. “We will not let this bunch of anti-Iranians in the White House be able to plot against us.”

IRAN'S PRESIDENT VOWS TO OVERCOME 'ANTI-IRANIANS' IN WHITE HOUSE, AS LAWMAKERS ISSUE PUBLIC REBUKE

Lawmakers, however, were not satisfied with the president's answer and voted four separate times to say they were unconvinced of his answers about Iran's recession, its cratering currency, unemployment and smuggling, according to the Associated Press. Iranian lawmakers have already fired Rouhani's labor and finance ministers this month amid the economic crisis.

But Khamenei insisted the political tumult was a sign of the strength of Iran's democracy, Agence France-Presse reported. The supreme leader called the tough questioning of Rouhani ""a glorious show of the power of the Islamic republic and the self-confidence of officials.""

IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: WHAT IS IT?

The supreme leader had set out a series of conditions in May for European powers if they wanted to keep Iran, according to Reuters, which included steps by European banks to safeguard trade with Tehran and guarantee Iranian oil sales. He told Rouhani and his cabinet to work ""day and night"" in an efforts to fix the faltering economy.

During his meeting with Rouhani and his cabinet on Wednesday, the supreme leader also reiterated that Iran would not engage with negotiations with President Trumps's administration over a potential new deal, despite an offer from the president for unconditional talks.

""(The Americans) want to say they can bring anyone, even the Islamic republic, to the negotiating table,"" Khamenei said, according to AFP. ""But as I have previously said in detail, no negotiations with them will take place.""

In recent days, rhetoric from Iran has increased as a top Iranian Navy general said the country has taken full control of the Strait of Hormuz and Persian Gulf.

IRAN CLAIMS IT CONTROLS STRAIT OF HORMUZ, PROMPTING POMPEO DENIAL

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded Monday night, saying: ""The Islamic Republic of Iran does not control the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait is an international waterway. The United States will continue to work with our partners to ensure freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in international waterways.""

Military officials echoed similar statements on Tuesday at a briefing with reporters at the Pentagon.

"Human remains discovered in Aruba, where Natalee Holloway vanished 12 years ago, are those of a female of Eastern European descent, tests showed.

The remains will be tested further to determine if they are those of Holloway and the results were expected within the next two weeks, the Daily Mail reported.

Holloway, 18, a straight-A student from Mountain Brook, Ala., disappeared from the island while celebrating her high school graduation.

The Daily Mail said her family had Eastern European heritage.

The discovery of the remains that may be those of Holloway was to be revealed in the docu-series “The Disappearance of Natalee Holloway.” The Oxygen series follows Holloway’s father, Dave, and private investigator T.J. Ward in their quest to find Natalee on the tropical island.

COULD THE HUMAN REMAINS FOUND IN ARUBA BE NATALEE HOLLOWAY? EXPERTS WEIGH IN

“We did an 18-month undercover investigation with an informant who was friends with an individual who had personal knowledge from Joran van der Sloot,” Dave Holloway told NBC's ""Today"" show last week.

Joran van der Sloot, a Dutch national, has long been considered a suspect in the case.

“And had information that took us to a spot where remains were found. And we took those remains and had those remains tested. And they just returned last week they are human remains,” Holloway said.

The Daily Mail reported that Holloway’s mother, Beth, gave a saliva sample to help with the testing.

""So far all the indicators are that these bone fragments are the human remains of a young female, consistent with someone of eastern European descent,” an unidentified source told the Daily Mail.

“It will be agonizing if Dave and Beth are told this is their daughter, but after 12 years of searching for answers it will be a huge deal for them - it might finally bring them closure,' the source continued.

NATALEE HOLLOWAY’S FINAL HOURS: NEW CLUES SURFACE IN TEEN’S DISAPPEARANCE

During their investigation, Holloway and Ward have discovered that Natalee was apparently last seen outside a bar before her disappearance with Van der Sloot, whom she met while on her trip. Holloway and Ward discovered the information through an informant named Gabriel who was roommates with John Ludwick, Van der Sloot’s best friend.

Gabriel said Van der Sloot tried to kiss Natalee after her drink was spiked with the date rape drug GHB but the teen started to foam at the mouth. Natalee choked to death on her vomit and Van der Sloot panicked and allegedly put her body in a burlap sack and buried her in an Aruban park, using a cactus plant to cover his tracks.

Van der Sloot allegedly confessed to his friend in confidence.

“They lived together for several months and during those months, Joran shared a lot of information with him that is not public knowledge. … And that’s one of the reasons we pursued this,” David Holloway said.

Van der Sloot is currently in a Peruvian prison serving a 28-year sentence for killing business student Stephany Flores just five years after Natalee vanished.

Gabriel also said that Van der Sloot was assisted by his father, Paulus, a judge in Aruba, in disposing of Natalee’s body, according to the Daily Mail.

Aruba Public Prosecutor Dorean Kardol disputed Holloway’s claims that human remains were found on the island.

“During an investigation by police in an area indicated by Mr. Holloway, we found remains, but they were found to be from animals,” Kardol said.

"North Korea showcased its latest weaponry and best goose-stepping soldiers Sunday as the reclusive nation marked its 70th anniversary with a military parade at a time when it is under international pressure to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.

Tens of thousands of North Koreans waved colored plastic bouquets in Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Square and held them up to spell out words and slogans as tanks and artillery rolled by.

No long-range missiles were on display, with the parade instead focusing on economic development. North Korea traditionally uses holidays to showcase its military arsenal and new technology.

The procession also celebrated civilian groups such as nurses, students and construction workers in an effort to emphasize the country’s economy.

The focus on the military and civilian sectors was not new to celebrations of North Korea’s founding.

In 2008 and 2013, the Korean People’s Army was not featured, only the civil defense units, officially called “Worker Peasant Red Guards.”

Kim Yong Nam, head of North Korea's parliament, set the relatively softer tone for the event with an opening speech that emphasized the economic goals of the regime, not its nuclear might. He called on the military to be ready to work to help build the economy.

Guests at the parade included the head of the Chinese parliament and high-level delegations from countries that have friendly ties with the North. North Korean leader Kim Jung-Un attended but did not address the crowd.

Afterward, he met with Chinese special envoy, Li Zhanshu, who is also the third-ranking member in China's ruling Communist Party. The two held up their joined hands to symbolize the countries' traditionally close ties, though the absence of Chinese President Xi Jinping could indicate Beijing still has some reservations about Kim's initiatives.

North Korea holds military parades almost every year and held one just before the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February.

This year’s parade wasn’t televised but the state media apparatus filmed it – even using drones with cameras.

Earlier in the day, North Korea media reported Kim visited the mausoleum where his grandfather, the country’s founder, and his father lie in state, Reuters reported.

The parade comes at a sensitive time in the region.

Washington wants North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program while Kim wants security concessions and a formal agreement ending the Korean War.

Kim will meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in the coming weeks to discuss a path toward denuclearization.

This year’s celebration also marks a return of North Korea’s Mass Games, which involve tens of thousands of people dancing in unison in a display of national unity.

"President Trump announced Monday he ordered the American flag to fly at half-staff through this coming Sunday to honor the late Sen. John McCain.

""Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain’s service to our country and, in his honor, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment,"" said Trump, who added that Vice President Mike Pence would make remarks at Friday's ceremony honoring McCain at the U.S. Capitol.

McCain will lie in state at the Capitol on Friday, officials have said. A memorial service will be held at the National Cathedral in Washington the following day before McCain is laid to rest at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Md., on Sunday.

Trump said White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Adviser John Bolton would represent the administration at the services.

The president made his first public comment on McCain's death Monday night at a dinner with evangelical leaders at the White House.

""Our hearts and prayers are going to the family of Sen. John McCain,"" Trump said. ""We appreciate everything McCain has done for our country.""

Trump's initial statement was made public moments after the White House flag was returned to half-staff Monday afternoon following complaints from two of America's most prominent veterans' groups.

The White House flags had been lowered Sunday, the day after the Arizona Republican succumbed to brain cancer at the age of 81. However, they were back to full height on Monday, breaking with tradition.

In a statement directed to Trump, American Legion National Commander Denise Rohan wrote: ""On the behalf of The American Legion's two million wartime veterans, I strongly urge you to make an appropriate presidential proclamation noting Senator McCain's death and legacy of service to our nation, and that our nation's flag be half-staffed through his interment.""

VFW spokesman Joe Davis said in a statement the organization had ""asked the White House if the honor of lowering the flag to half-staff could be extended through Senator McCain's interment.""

Aides to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. R-Ky., and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., previously requested the Defense Department keep flags at government buildings lowered until the sunset after McCain is buried. McCain served in the chamber for six terms, most recently as chairman of the Armed Services Committee.

U.S. Flag Code states that flags be lowered ""on the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress.""

McCain was a frequent critic of Trump on everything from his leadership style to his Russia policy. Trump questioned the decorated Navy pilot's Vietnam heroism and chafed at McCain's vote to stop the president's proposed ""ObamaCare"" repeal.

After Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts died in 2009, President Barack Obama ordered flags at the White House flown at half-staff for five days.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

EDITOR’S NOTE: A previous version of this report stated that under “standard procedure,” the U.S. flag remains at half-staff until after a senator’s burial. U.S. Code states that the flag shall be flown at half-staff “on the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress,” including U.S. senators.",politics

"President Trump threw his unabashed support behind Tiger Woods on Sunday, a week after the golfer opened up about respecting the office -- regardless of any agreements or disagreements with the president.

“Tiger Woods showed great class in the way he answered the question about the Office of the Presidency and me,” Trump tweeted. “Now they say the so-called ‘left’ is angry at him. So sad, but the ‘center & right’ loves Tiger, Kanye, George Foreman, Jim Brown & so many other greats, even more.......”

Woods was responding to a question last week about Trump’s policies, his feuds with NBA and NFL players and whether the golfer had anything to say to people who “find it interesting” that he maintains a rather personal relationship with the president.

“He's the president of the United States. You have to respect the office. No matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office,” Woods said during a news conference just after the final round of the PGA Northern Trust tournament.

One reporter asked Woods, “At times, especially 2018, I think a lot of people, especially immigrants, are threatened by him and his policy — what do you say to people who might find it interesting that you have a friendly relationship with him?”

“Well, I’ve known Donald for a number of years,” Woods responded. “We've played golf together. We've had dinner together. I've known him pre-presidency and obviously during his presidency.”

Woods’ comments drew strong criticism from many in sports world.

ESPN’s “First Take” co-host Max Kellerman blasted Woods’ remarks, saying it was a “thoughtless statement dressed up as a thoughtful statement.”

He continued, “And it either holds in contempt the intelligence of people who hear it or else it’s just a stupid thing to say. … To say you must have respect for the office — Tiger, be clear. Are you saying that the office, therefore, confers respect onto its present temporary occupant? No. Having respect for the office means principally, in my view, is the office holder should have respect for the office.”

The other names cited in Trump's tweet all have praised the president in recent months. Kanye West, in a tweetstorm heard 'round the world, wrote last April: “You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.”

Foreman, a boxing legend, called Trump “a good president” last year. He said that around the time of his boxing heyday, “We were patriotic. The greatest day of my life was when I put on the colors, representing the United States.”

Brown, an NFL star enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, said last month: “I should be criticizing Trump on every level because he does certain things that call for criticism, but when I look at television I see all these announcers become experts and they’re pointing the fingers and they’re not doing a doggone thing but pointing their fingers, I find myself really pulling for the president.”

Trump followed up his Woods tweet by writing: “The fact is that African/American unemployment is now the lowest in the history of our country. Same with Asian, Hispanic and almost every other group. The Democrats have been all talk and no action. My Administration has already produced like no other, and everyone sees it!”

"A friendly yet ""lonely"" deer wandering around a lake in Canada became a viral star after a photo online showed the animal snuggling up to a firefighter.

Jan Giesbrecht was near Burns Lake in British Columbia on Wednesday, transporting firefighters to and from a fire camp in the area, when she spotted the peculiar encounter.

Giesbrecht told Canada's Global News outlet that the deer was on the Francois Lake Ferry, seemingly looking for friends among the humans.

""He wanders around visiting people,"" she said, adding that the deer often was spotted in the area. ""He seems lonely and wants attention.""

Another photo showed the deer sneaking a peek inside Giesbrecht's bus after the animal saw firefighters climbing aboard, and even later followed the bus as Giesbrecht drove around.

A witness told the CBC that the deer, named ""Elliot"" by his family, ""is like a dog -- it comes up to you and I can pay it on the back, it licks my hand.""

""It's just the friendliest deer going,"" Grand Borden said. ""For him to be so friendly, it's kind of bizarre and a little unnerving at first.""

Some 300 Venezuelans gathered outside of their country's embassy in Peru on Tuesday shouting ""We want to leave!"" after President Nicolas Maduro offered to airlift migrants who wanted to return back to their homeland.

The Venezuelans, some of whom said they had been sleeping on the streets and were taken advantage of by Peruvian employers, arrived hours after Maduro on national TV unveiled the ""Return to the Homeland Plan"" to welcome back those who marched abroad amid the spiraling economic and social crisis.

It also comes as regional governments are rushing to address the exodus straining tight budgets in almost every South American nation, with a special session Wednesday at the Organization of American States in Washington.

According to the United Nations, more than 2.3 million people, 7 percent of Venezuela's total population, have fled the country over the last three years during a period of widespread shortages, deadly anti-government protests and now hyperinflation the International Monetary Fund estimates will hit 1 million percent.

But Venezuela's government disputes those figures, and is accusing opponents led by the U.S. of sounding an alarm about a humanitarian crisis to justify a foreign military intervention to remove Maduro.

""I sometimes feel pain for the Venezuelans who left,"" he said on state TV Monday, saying that fewer than 600,000 Venezuelans left the country over the past two years and that 90 percent regret the decision. ""We will hug you again, come to Venezuela, come back to the homeland. We Venezuelans are here, with our big, big Bolivian hearts.""

Last week, Maduro's government chartered a plane to bring almost 100 Venezuelans from Lima that he said had their dreams of a fresh start crushed by the crude realities of living in a high-priced capitalist country. Another airlift is schedule to leave Ecuador on Wednesday, while a second planeload of Venezuelans from Peru is being organized for Saturday.

Some government opponents have called the airlifts a PR stunt intended to deflect attention away from the economic mismanagement that has driven so many people from their homes in the first place.

Those lining up outside Venezuelan embassy in Peru's capital were careful not to criticize Maduro — many acknowledged voting for him in the past — and spoke of enduring hardships and discrimination while trying to adjust to life in a new country.

Armando Salazar, 50, said that he was earning around $90 a week cleaning floors at a fish processing plant since arriving to Peru in January from his home in central Carabobo state. But last month he was let go and had to resort to peddling bottles of water on Lima's streets while sharing a tenement bedroom with five of his countrymen who were in similar straights.

""Things are difficult here too,"" said Salazar, who said that once back in Venezuela he hopes to recoup a business he abandoned selling fruit.

He said the future he faces in Venezuela remains uncertain but at least back home he'll be surrounded by family, including his wife, who didn't make the journey with him across South America.

Inflation that the International Monetary Fund estimates will soon hit 1 million percent is expected to accelerate after Maduro last month began dismantling price and currency controls in place for more than a decade.

On Tuesday, the government began rolling out a new payment system to raise gas prices in eight border states. The goal is to raise prices nationwide to international levels by October so they government can boost badly-needed revenue to pay its mounting debts. Right now filling up a tank is virtually free.

It's the first major increase in gas prices since Hugo Chavez's socialist revolution began two decades ago and authorities in the OPEC nation are taking a slow approach amid fears it could ignite unrest like past price hikes. To soften the impact, drivers holding a government-issued Fatherland Card will be returned part of the payment in the form of a cash subsidy.

But despite long lines, many gas stations in Tachira state with neighboring Colombia were closed Tuesday, or had yet to raise prices. The new biometric machines to collect payments that the head of the state oil company displayed on state television a day earlier were either nowhere to be found or not working.

On Tuesday, officials from 11 countries in the region issued a statement expressing concern for the ""the grave deterioration in the internal situation that has provoked the mass migration of Venezuelans.""

"A U.S. Catholic charity has cut short a controversial $25 million grant requested by Pope Francis for an Italian hospital ridden with scandal after donors objected to the massive handout.

The Papal Foundation paid only half of the enormous grant for Istituto Dermopatico dell’Immacolata (IDI), a Catholic dermatological hospital in Rome with a history of financial scandals, after significant objections by lay members who objected to what they saw as an “outmuscling” of lay voices by cardinals and bishops on the board.



The grant, first reported by the Catholic LifeSiteNews, was requested by the pontiff in June. The Papal Foundation typically grants about $8 to 9 million each year to various causes selected by the Pope -- normally about $200,000 per grant.



But the June request for $25 million over three years -- which a source familiar with the grant told Fox News was a stand-alone, urgent request outside of the typically designated approval process -- infuriated and concerned staff.



According to the Associated Press, Italian prosecutors in 2013 discovered an almost $1 billion hole in the hospital's account, and placed 40 people under investigation for alleged money laundering, fraudulent bankruptcy and other crimes. So far 24 indictments have been handed down. The Vatican soon took control of the hospital, but it continued to struggle.



The Foundation, in a letter to lay members or stewards, admitted that there was a “significant degree of discontent” among the stewards over the grant, which was approved in a secret board meeting vote in December -- a vote which included a number of U.S. bishops and cardinals, including Archbishop of Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl and Archbishop of New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan.



James Longon, the head of the board’s audit committee resigned after he sent a letter to fellow stewards in which he outlined in grim terms the state of the hospital.

“The IDI hospital had been a media and legal disgrace with embezzlement and fraud and bankruptcy. We've been told that the bad guys are gone, but so are some of the notable doctors,” the letter said. “Tinged with scandal, this 147-bed dermatological hospital in Rome has bad morale, inefficient administration and $24 million in unpaid vendor bills.”

He accused the board of pushing through the vote without giving members sufficient information, and without a detailed proposal.

Longon claimed that in a “carefully choreographed process” the 15 bishops outvoted nine stewards with a 15-8 vote of approval (one abstention).

“It was a clear out-muscling of the Stewards. Political favor replaced sound stewardship of our resources,” he wrote.



But a source familiar with the process told Fox News that the foundation did do its due diligence before the vote. The source said claims were somewhat assuaged after a review was conducted that found that the religious order seen as responsible for much of the scandal had been moved away, and the debt was sealed off within that order. Additionally, the Foundation was told that the grant would go to funding the hospital’s operations, not paying down debt.



It is understood that the the niche hospital was viewed as a model within the Italian health care system, particularly for charity-run health care even despite its troubles, and there was concern that its closure would hurt patients and employees.



The backlash from lay members appears to have had an impact. The foundation announced in its January letter that Cardinal Wuerl had written to the Vatican to cut short the grant, of which approximately $12 to 13 million had already been paid out.



Additionally, the board announced a policy by which any grant of more than $1 million must be approved by a majority of both lay and clerical trustees, an apparent reference to complaints that Vatican-connected clergy had rubber-stamped a highly dubious papal request.

A spokesman for Wuerl's office referred Fox News to the foundation, which declined in a statement to comment on individual grant requests.



“The Papal Foundation’s mission and guiding principles have not changed. The grants to help those in need around the world and of significance to the Holy Father are reviewed and approved through well-accepted philanthropic processes by the Board and its committees,” the statement said.



The lay-based revolt is the latest to anger grassroots Catholics and inflict damage on Pope Francis' often-troubled time leading the church.

DESPITE DENIAL, POPE FRANCIS RECEIVED SEX ABUSE VICTIM'S LETTER: REPORT



The Vatican is still reeling from a fateful trip to Chile in January in which Francis backed a powerful bishop he appointed to a Chilean diocese who was accused of shielding a priest who sexually abused minors. Francis said the bishop, Juan Barros, was the victim of slander and that there was no evidence against him.



While the subsequent outroar from victims marred his trip and forced him to apologize, it became a full-blown crisis after it was revealed that Francis had in fact received a hand-delivered letter detailing an account of the abuse and the subsequent cover-up in 2015.",world
"Senate Democrats grilled Judge Brett Kavanaugh on abortion, guns and other issues Wednesday, getting down to substance after an opening day of partisan fireworks -- even as protesters continued to disrupt his confirmation hearing.

Kavanaugh, President Trump’s pick to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, appeared for the second day of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It’s the first day senators have to question Kavanaugh.

California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s ranking member and the first Democrat to question the nominee, began her questioning of Kavanaugh by referencing the outbursts.

“I'm sorry about the circumstances, but we'll get through it,” she said.

Feinstein asked the nominee about his past case argument that Washington D.C.’s assault weapons ban was unconstitutional. He said he was following the precedent of the Supreme Court.

Kavanaugh, who grew up near Washington, replied that he fully understands how gang, gun and drug violence plagues cities “but as a judge, my job as I saw it was to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court.""

Feinstein pressed Kavanaugh over the Roe v. Wade court decision regarding abortion.

“Well, as a general proposition, I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe versus Wade,” he said.

Feinstein also asked Kavanaugh about past comments regarding investigations involving a president, a key issue amid the Russia probe that has implicated numerous Trump associates. A staffer held up a sign with a 1999 law review quote from Kavanaugh that said, “If the president were the sole subject of an investigation, I would say no one should be investigating that.”

Kavanaugh said he’s never taken a position on the constitutionality of whether a president should be investigated while in office. He claimed those past comments were about the “balance of a president fighting a war, leading a war, and a president subject to say ordinary civil lawsuits,” like former President Bill Clinton faced.

Kavanaugh, a former lawyer under President George W. Bush, used the hearing to portray himself as an independent judge.

“The first thing that makes a good judge is independence, not being swayed by political or public pressure,” Kavanaugh said, under questioning from committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. “That takes some backbone, that takes some judicial fortitude.”

Democrats on the panel, including a number thought to be considering a presidential run in 2020, Democrats, have sounded the alarm about Kavanaugh’s past work in Republican politics, including as a lawyer in George W. Bush’s White House.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., pressed Kavanaugh about what he knew about the Bush administration’s warrantless surveillance program. Leahy also asked Kavanaugh if a president has a right to pardon himself, a power President Trump has said he believes he has.

“The question of self-pardons is something I have never analyzed,” Kavanaugh replied, calling it a “hypothetical question that I can't begin to answer in this context as a sitting judge and as a nominee to the Supreme Court.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., gave Kavanaugh a chance to address the father of a student killed in Florida school massacre this year, among other activists, who showed up to the hearing. That father made news after unsuccessfully attempting to shake Kavanaugh's hand during a break on Tuesday.

“I want to reassure everyone that I base my decisions on the law, but I do so with an awareness of the facts and an awareness of the real world consequences,” Kavanaugh replied, adding, “I have not lived in a bubble.”

The Republicans and Democrats on the panel are being given 30 minutes each to ask Kavanaugh questions on live television. The questioning could go late into the evening Wednesday, and is set to continue through the week.

Moments after Grassley opened the hearing Wednesday, shouting could be heard from the back of the room: “Sham president, sham justice!”

The interruptions from protesters that started a day earlier continued, as Grassley dinged Democrats for wasting time a day earlier on “disruption and disorder over procedural matters.”

“Democratic senators interrupted the hearing 63 times before lunch and in the audience 70 people were arrested yesterday who were following their lead,” Grassley said.

Ironically, protesters continued to shout as Kavanaugh discussed how he tried to be respectful in court.

""I’ve tried to be a very collegial judge, I’ve tried to be civil,"" he said.

When the disruptions continued, Kavanaugh asked Grassley, “Should I proceed?”

Grassley told Kavanaugh to continue speaking, despite the outbursts.

“Let these people have their free speech and interrupt the other 300 million people listening,” the Iowa Republican said.

KAVANAUGH VOWS TO 'KEEP AN OPEN MIND IN EVERY CASE'

The protests have been a recurring feature since the hearings began.

“I just wish we could have a hearing where the nominee's kids could show up,"" Graham of South Carolina said, referencing the outbursts. ""Is that asking too much?”

As a protester yelled, Graham continued: “So what kind of country have we become? None of this happened just a couple years ago. It's getting worse and worse and worse.""

On Tuesday, protests from Democratic lawmakers and demonstrators delayed the formal start of proceedings by more than an hour.

The spectacle has underscored the political nature of the confirmation hearings, coming two months before the midterms and as some senators gear up for a possible 2020 presidential run against Trump. Several of those senators led the charge Tuesday in objecting to Kavanaugh.

Kavanaugh has left one of the longest paper trails of any recent Supreme Court nominee, having served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office in the George W. Bush administration.

Kavanaugh also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.

Democrats have specifically raised objections over how the Senate received 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents the night before the confirmation hearing began.

Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch.

The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee.

Republicans command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, which would return to 51-49 once a Republican successor to the late Sen. John McCain is seated. While the hearing was ongoing Tuesday, former Sen. Jon Kyl was named to that seat.

Republicans have said they hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

"Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., told Fox News on Thursday night that charges filed against him and his wife, Margaret, were “pure politics” and that he never used campaign funds for personal spending.

Hunter and his wife were indicted on charges of illegally converting $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses and filing false records. They pleaded not guilty on Thursday.

Speaking to Fox News’ Martha MacCallum on “The Story,” Hunter said many of the trips in question “were fundraisers.”

He continued, “That’s how we campaign and try to raise money is by traveling, having dinners, meeting people and raising more money. That’s how people get to hear me and hear what I have to say, and they donate money.”

Still, he added, “My campaign did make mistakes. There was money spent on things, not by me but by the campaign, and I paid that back before my last election. I paid back $60,000 dollars after I did an objective audit. This is pure politics.”

Hunter said that he has been a “prolific fundraiser” and has raised “millions and millions of dollars for the Republican party, and for myself and other candidates.”

The congressman was pressed about a specific accusation: that he wanted to buy a pair of shorts during a Hawaii vacation but didn't have the money, so his wife told him to buy the clothing at a golf shop and describe the purchase later as “[golf] balls for the wounded warriors.”

“I don’t remember that but I would never do that,” Hunter said.

He also said that his wife handled most of the family expenses when he was first deployed to Iraq in 2003 and that she continued to manage them when he joined Congress.

“When I went away to Iraq in 2003, the first time, I gave her power of attorney. She handled my finances throughout my entire military career and that continued on when I got into Congress... She was also the campaign manager so whatever she did, that’ll be looked at too, I’m sure, but I didn’t do it.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., this week called the charges “deeply serious” and said Hunter would be removed from the three House committees on which he sat. Hunter agreed to comply with Ryan's request and step down from his assignments -- avoiding the spectacle of a debate and vote on the House floor.

"Former President Bill Clinton’s name no longer adorns the Democratic Party’s major fall fundraising dinner in the state that made him “the comeback kid” and launched him on the road to the White House.

The New Hampshire state party announced Tuesday that their annual Kennedy-Clinton Dinner will now be known as the Eleanor Roosevelt Dinner, in honor of the famous first lady who went on to serve as the first U.S. delegate to the United Nations.

""We are proud to honor Eleanor Roosevelt, a woman revered around the world for her bold leadership and tireless efforts to create justice. She dedicated her life to helping all hard-working Americans and all those who needed a champion,"" state party Chairman Ray Buckley said in a statement.

The change comes amid the rise of the “Me Too” movement, which has drawn attention to examples of powerful men in politics, media and business who have sexually harassed women in the workplace.

That movement has revived longstanding sexual misconduct allegations against the former president. Clinton has sustained political fallout for years over his affair with Monica Lewinsky and allegations of sexual assault by women such as Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey. (Clinton has apologized for his behavior with Lewinsky, but has denied the Broaddrick and Willey allegations.)

President Trump has also faced -- and denied -- allegations of past sexual misconduct, which have grown since the release of the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape.

The New Hampshire name change was months in the making.

Last November, hours before the Kennedy-Clinton dinner was held, the chairwoman of the New Hampshire GOP urged her Democratic counterpart to drop Clinton’s name from the dinner.

And at a major Democratic state party meeting a few weeks after the event was held, a small group of vocal activists staged a small protest urging that Clinton’s name be dropped.

While no action was taken at the time, two top state Democratic Party officials predicted there could be a move to change the dinner’s name in the months to come.

That move happened last week, when the party’s state committee voted to strip the names of both Clinton and the late President John F. Kennedy from the dinner. The state party announced the move on Tuesday.

The renaming of the dinner may sting the 42nd president, as New Hampshire is hallowed ground for Bill Clinton. Following claims from former night club singer Gennifer Flowers that she had a 12-year affair with Clinton, his presidential campaign was at its lowest point in early February 1992, when he arrived in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House.

But Clinton’s strong second-place finish in New Hampshire boosted his campaign, lifting him toward the Democratic nomination and eventually the presidency.

Clinton headlined the fall fundraising gathering in 2014, when it was known as the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner. But two years later, the event was renamed the Kennedy-Clinton dinner when the New Hampshire Democratic Party joined other state parties in stripping the names of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson from the annual dinner over their histories as slave owners in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Now the dinner’s named after Roosevelt, the wife of four-term President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. She also served as first chair of the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women.

Buckley noted that New Hampshire is the first state with an all-Democratic and all-female congressional delegation, and added that “the Eleanor Roosevelt Dinner is particularly fitting given our party’s steadfast commitment to electing Democratic women.”",politics
"The Haskell Free Library and Opera House in Derby Line, Vt. is famously intersected by the U.S.-Canada border. For one career criminal, it was the perfect place to commit a crime.

Alexis Vlachos, of Montreal, Canada, was sentenced Tuesday to more than four years in prison for smuggling 100 firearms through the bathroom at the library.

The 41-year-old man led a three-man operation that brought weapons from licensed dealers in Florida to Vermont between July 2010 and April 2011.

His co-conspirators would arrive at the library and hide a backpack containing the handguns in a trashcan in the bathroom before leaving, VT Digger reported.

Vlachos, who was already in the library from Quebec, then would grab the backpack of guns stashed in the bathroom and walk out of the library.

While the exit is in Vermont, he would just cross into Canada without ever stopping at a border checkpoint, Seven Days reported.

Court records showed he sold many of the guns in Quebec.

“The crescendo of the smuggling scheme was in April 2011 when the defendant himself hiked across a remote section of the border near Wallace Lake in Vermont with about 34 handguns in a backpack,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Perella, the prosecutor, wrote in a filing, according to VT Digger.

“The defendant also played a critical role in selling many of these firearms, often for a hefty price in Canada,” Perella added. “The serial numbers of the firearms were obliterated before they were sold.”

Canadian authorities nabbed Vlachos in February 2015 – with a hockey bag full of smuggled cartons of cigarettes.

Vlachos admitted earlier this year to smuggling guns into Quebec and pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and unlawfully exporting handguns from the United States to Canada.

In federal court on Tuesday, Vlachos said he a changed man and that greed led to him his criminal career. But he said that it was all behind him.

""I was blinded by easy money, greed, selfishness and opportunism,"" Vlachos told Judge William Sessions III, Seven Days reported. ""Definitely, I'm not the same person.""

He apologized for violating ""the trust ... of our two great nations.""

While prosecutors sought a sentenced of 104 months behind bars for Vlachos – one month for every smuggled firearm – the judge ultimately ruled on a 51-month sentence.

Vlachos will likely receive credit for the 43 months he has been in custody since he was arrested in Canada prior to his extradition to the U.S.

"Two people were killed and one other was wounded Thursday in a knife attack outside Paris, authorities said.

The stabbing occurred in Trappes, located about 20 miles west of Paris. The assailant, who was only identified as a male, was killed by police.

The man first sheltered in a house after attacking passersby and then was shot dead by police, according to BFM-TV. The man was reportedly known to intelligence services.

Islamic State claimed the attack through its propaganda arm, but failed to provide evidence.

Gerard Collomb, France’s interior minister, praised the officers’ efforts in taking down the attacker and announced that an investigation was ongoing.

Officials haven’t determined whether the stabbing was a terror attack.

Authorities urged residents to avoid the area around Rue Camille Claudel while a police operation was underway.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a New York City native, raised eyebrows last week after he claimed that he was an illegal immigrant and taunted officials to deport him.

“I’m undocumented. You want to deport an undocumented person, start with me because I’m an undocumented person,” Cuomo, 60, said during a bill signing.

During the bizarre speech, the New York governor criticized the ""extreme conservative movement"" for being ""anti-immigrant."" He said his family, who emigrated to the U.S. from Italy, was constantly ridiculed with a racial slur that he said meant “without papers.”

“I’m an Italian-American. I came from poor Italian-Americans who came here. You know what they called Italian-Americans back in the day? They called them wops,” Cuomo said, referring to the pejorative slur for Italians. “You know what wop stood for? Without papers.”

“I’m undocumented. You want to deport an undocumented person, start with me because I’m an undocumented person."" - Andrew Cuomo

According to the Online Etymology dictionary, the slur originated from southern Italian dialect “guappo,” which means “dandy, dude, stud.” The dictionary said it’s not an acronym.

A day earlier, Cuomo addressed a group of union workers and said he was “raised by poor immigrants from South Jamaica,” a neighborhood in Queens, New York. His father Mario, a three-term governor of New York, was born in Queens to Italian immigrant parents. His mother, Matilda, was also born in Queens.

Immigrant advocacy group Make the Road Action has called on Cuomo to apologize for the comments.

“To Dreamer and immigrants like me, these fabrications are offensive,” Make the Road Action member Antonio Alarcon said in a statement, adding that the governor “has no idea what it’s like to live as an undocumented person.”

“For those of us who came to this country with our parents to find a better life, and have struggled daily to get by and faced the threat of being torn from our family, it’s unbelievable that the governor would try to claim to have shared our experience,” he said.

Cuomo received condemnation for his false comments on social media, as well, including from Dictionary.com which tweeted the definition of the word ""undocumented"" along with the hashtag #Cuomo.

Cuomo is facing a primary opponent this year in Cynthia Nixon, an actress and activist. He's currently ahead of Nixon by a significant amount, but the lead has dwindled over recent weeks.

Cuomo's office did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Thursday afternoon.",politics
"The Senate Judiciary Committee launches confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday, kicking off what is expected to be a bitterly partisan gauntlet as Democrats vow to scrutinize his lengthy record as an appellate judge and lawyer in the Bush administration.

Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch and leading Democrats to ratchet up their rhetoric.

Last month, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., accused anyone who supports Kavanaugh of being ""complicit in evil."" After ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s guilty plea – which was used by Democrats to push for Kavanaugh delays – Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, even nixed a one-on-one meeting with the nominee, claiming Trump had picked him ""purposely ... to protect, as we say in Hawaii, his own okole"" from possible criminal charges. Some Democrats, including Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., had rejected Trump's selection before they even knew who it was, predicting the nomination process would be a ""corrupt bargain with the far Right, big corporations, and Washington special interests.""

WATCH: 'OUTNUMBERED' CALLS OUT CORY BOOKER'S DOOMSDAY RHETORIC ON KAVANAUGH

But Kavanaugh steadily has gathered support from legal circles, former colleagues and Republican lawmakers. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called him ""perhaps the most qualified person ever nominated to the Supreme Court.""

The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee.

Republicans command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, which would return to 51-49 once a Republican successor to the late Sen. John McCain is appointed. Republicans have little margin for error, though Vice President Pence can break a tie.

Who are the senators to watch?

Among the key votes on the Democratic side are Indiana's Joe Donnelly, West Virginia's Joe Manchin and North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp. All three voted to confirm Gorsuch to the Supreme Court last year, and all are up for re-election in November in states that went for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Each has also met with Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill, and has promised to carefully weigh the upcoming hearings before making a final call.

Alabama Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who recently won a special election and will be up for election in 2020, is also considered a potential yes vote on the nominee. But he recently said he wanted to delay Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, citing the ""cloud"" of suspicion around Trump and his desire to see more documents from his time in the Bush White House. Jones claimed his view was shared by “everybody else around here on the Democratic side of the aisle"" -- but some Democrats, including Manchin, dismissed those last-minute concerns, saying there was no basis to delay the hearings.

Even before former Trump attorney Cohen pleaded guilty last month to several federal charges, Democrats had already called for Kavanaugh's hearings to be postponed until after the November midterms, in retaliation for Senate Republicans' decision to deny a vote on then-President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016.

DEMS CALL COHEN GUILTY PLEA 'GAME CHANGER,' CALL FOR POSTPONING KAVANAUGH HEARINGS

Meanwhile, outside groups have been pressuring moderate Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Both have promised to remain independent and carefully consider the results of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, but have given some clues on their leanings.

Last month, Murkowski vowed to take a ""similar, if not identical … approach I took for Justices Gorsuch, Kagan, Sotomayor, Alito and Roberts"" in vetting the nomination. Murkowski voted to confirm Kavanaugh to a seat on the influential D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006.

And Collins, who also voted to confirm Kavanaugh in 2006, acknowledged shortly after Trump nominated him to the Supreme Court that he has ""impressive credentials and extensive experience, having served more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.""

Notably, Collins has rejected calls from Democrats to delay Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, saying there was ""no basis"" for the move. After meeting with Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill, Collins said Kavanaugh had reassured her that Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case that established a constitutional right to an abortion, was ""settled law.""

NARAL Pro-Choice America and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars targeting Murkowski and Collins specifically, Politico reported, in an effort to sway them against Kavanaugh.

Another influential liberal group opposing Kavanaugh, the Alliance for Justice (AFJ), told Fox News that both Collins and Murkowski would jeopardize their reputations by failing to vote down his confirmation.

""For someone like Collins or Murkowski, their legacy is really on the line here,"" AFJ Legal Director Dan Goldberg said. ""Whatever votes they had in the past to protect women, to protect health care, would long be forgotten -- they would have to own every decision Brett Kavanaugh makes.""

Goldberg added that Kavanaugh's national poll numbers are ""consistent with Robert Bork and Harriet Miers"" when they were under consideration for Supreme Court posts they ultimately didn't receive. A Fox News poll last month showed voters evenly divided on Kavanaugh.

After his sit-down with Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill last month, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also made his case to Murkowski and Collins.

SCHUMER SUGGESTS KAVANAUGH LYING ABOUT HIS TIME IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE: 'THIS IS A BRIGHT MAN'

""He would not give me any reassurance that he believed Roe or [Planned Parenthood v. Casey] were correctly decided or should be left alone,"" Schumer claimed. ""That should send shivers down the spine of any American who believes in reproductive freedom.""

Sen. Booker echoed that line of attack after his own meeting with Kavanaugh, telling reporters, ""A lot of folks were wondering that he might not overturn Roe v. Wade. ... He confirmed with me that that door was still wide open.""

Still, Schumer, who also implied Kavanaugh was lying about the details of his time in the Bush White House, acknowledged that Kavanaugh had told Collins that Roe was settled law.

""I understand that the judge told other members today that he considered Roe v. Wade settled law,"" Schumer said, before adding, ""He did not say that to me.""

Kavanaugh's paper trail -- asset or liability?

Kavanaugh has left one of the longest paper trails of any recent Supreme Court nominee, having served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office in the George W. Bush administration. Kavanaugh also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.

In looking at Kavanaugh's jurisprudence, Democrats will likely focus on Kavanaugh's decisions in cases like Priests for Life v. HHS, in which Kavanaugh wrote a dissent arguing that ObamaCare's contraceptive coverage requirements put undue burdens on some religious beliefs.

Both parties are also likely to grill Kavanaugh on his 2011 dissent in an ObamaCare case, Sevensky v. Holder, which Republican critics have claimed effectively provided the Supreme Court with a roadmap to uphold the law's contentious individual mandate provision. In his dissent, Kavanaugh wrote that only a ""minor tweak"" to the text of ObamaCare -- which required individuals to purchase health coverage or pay a monetary cost -- would bring it within the ambit of Congress' established power under the Constitution's Taxing Clause.

Chief Justice John Roberts would later provide the swing vote to uphold to ObamaCare's individual mandate by citing Congress' power under the Taxing Clause, instead of adopting the Obama administration's arguments that the law was justified broadly under the Constitution's expansive authority to generally regulate interstate commerce.

But others, including a former Kavanuagh law clerk, called that interpretation ""nonsense"" and argued that Kavanaugh, in fact, was outlining why Congress' Taxing Clause could not save ObamaCare from unconstitutionality.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EMERGES AS NEXT DEM LITMUS TEST

Democrats are also expected to question Kavanaugh about Garza v. Hargan, a recent case in which Kavanaugh dissented from a ruling that the Trump administration should permit an illegal immigrant in federal custody to have an abortion. Kavanaugh's dissent managed to anger both sides of the abortion debate, because while Kavanaugh did not endorse the immigrant's right to an abortion, his dissent also did not specifically deny her that right in all cases.

In the wake of several high-profile school shootings, Democrats may further zero in on Kavanaugh's position on gun rights. Kavanaugh dissented in the landmark Heller case when it was before the D.C. Circuit, arguing that a D.C. ordinance unconstitutionally infringed on residents' right to own semi-automatic weapons by requiring them to keep them unloaded and unassembled, or bound by a trigger lock.

Additionally, liberal groups have highlighted Kavanaugh's record on the environment, saying that he has overzealously struck down Environmental Protection Agency regulations. In a case last year, Mexichem Flour v. EPA, Kavanaugh wrote a majority opinion that struck down a 2015 EPA rule regulating hydrofluorocarbons, which analysts say led to substantially increased greenhouse gasses. Kavanaugh reviewed the text of the Clean Air Act and the legislative history before writing that the EPA's rule had exceeded the agency's statutory authority under the Clean Air Act -- although he sounded a note of regret in the process.

""However much we might sympathize or agree with EPA's policy objectives, EPA may act only within the boundaries of its statutory authority,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""Here, EPA exceeded that authority.""

MEDIA'S BIGGEST MISSES: ASPIRING KAVANAUGH HIT PIECES DRAW MOCKERY

But Supreme Court nominees are typically unwilling to offer much insight into their legal philosophies during confirmation hearings, which carries a major political risk and could prejudice future cases before the Supreme Court. There was also a greater potential for Democrats to score points by questioning Kavanaugh on his record as a Bush administration lawyer and adviser to Kenneth Starr, especially given that his writings in those capacities were less guarded than a typical judicial opinion.

During the Clinton investigation, for example, Kavanaugh unloaded on Clinton, telling Starr that the president should be impeached, citing his ""revolting"" behavior in the Oval Office and ""sheer number of wrongful acts."" But since his time in the Bush White House, Kavanaugh has argued that presidents should not have to endure lengthy probes during their time in office, saying in 2009 that indicting sitting presidents would ""ill serve the public interest,"" especially in times of financial or national security crisis.

He wrote in an article that year: “[T]he nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots.”

That language has alarmed top Democrats, who have voiced concerns that Kavanaugh would vote to shoot down a subpoena or even indictment of President Trump if one were filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller or other federal prosecutors.

Meanwhile, Democratic concerns that Kavanaugh may have misled the Senate Judiciary Committee during his 2006 confirmation hearings for his D.C. Circuit post have fizzled in recent weeks. A document dump last month from Kavanaugh's time in the Bush White House suggested that he had, in fact, offered legal advice on attorney-client privilege issues surrounding terror detainees, even though he said under oath that he had no involvement in ""rules governing the detention of combatants."" The White House has maintained Kavanaugh's statements were truthful, and the controversy died down.

Nevertheless, Goldberg, the AFJ legal director, said he anticipates that Democrats will hammer the issue during this week's hearings.

""There are certainly questions about his candor and veracity in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee when he was first confirmed --- issues that I know Sen. [Patrick] Leahy will press him on in the hearing,"" Goldberg told Fox News, referring to the long-time Vermont Democratic senator who serves on the Judiciary Committee. Leahy has opposed Kavanaugh dating back to his 2003 nomination to the D.C. Circuit, saying he had ""failed to demonstrate his capacity for independence."" Democrats stalled Kavanaugh's appellate court nomination until 2006.

In recent days, Democrats, including Leahy, have cried foul that the Kavanaugh paper trail is actually not long enough, saying they have been denied access to all the documents they need to vet his nomination. Schumer has threatened to sue the National Archives, which is handling their requests for documents from Kavanaugh's public service. He has also sharply criticized the procedure for the ongoing document production, saying it's inappropriate that a Republican lawyer is vetting all documents before their release.

Despite Kavanaugh's voluminous record -- and the all-out contentious rhetoric surrounding it -- Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, has said Republicans hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

"Melissa Howard, the GOP candidate for a Florida state House seat who was accused of lying about her college degree and NRA rating apologized on Monday, pledging to stay in the race “and lead by example from now on.”

After questions arose about Howard’s academic credentials, the state House candidate posted a photo of what she said was a copy of her transcripts to Facebook. She also sent photos of what she said was her diploma to media outlets, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported.

But Robin Parker, general counsel for Miami University, told the Herald-Tribune that Howard never graduated from the college and questioned the diploma’s authenticity.

On Monday Howard admitted on her Facebook page that she didn't graduate from the school.

""I made a mistake in saying that I completed my degree. What I did was wrong and set a bad example for someone seeking public service. I am staying in the race and intend to win and lead by example from now on,"" she said.

Even if she dropped out, it's too late to get her name off the ballot ahead of the Aug. 28 primary. Vote-by-mail ballots were sent out a month ago. The seat represents portions of Manatee and Sarasota counties, where about 20,000 Republican votes already have been cast.

The Herald-Tribune also reported that Howard posted about an A rating from the National Rifle Association on Facebook; however, Marion Hammer, a former NRA president who now leads the group's lobbying efforts in Florida, said Howard actually received a B grade.

Howard did not specifically reference the NRA rating controversy in her Monday apology.

Her primary opponent, Tommy Gregory, didn't immediately comment.

A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the United States has cut secret deals with al-Qaida fighters, paying some to leave key cities and towns the militants had seized across Yemen and letting others retreat with weapons, equipment and wads of looted cash, an investigation by The Associated Press has found. Hundreds more were recruited to join the coalition itself.

Again and again over the past two years, the coalition has claimed to win decisive victories that drove al-Qaida militants from their strongholds and shattered their ability to attack the West. What the victors didn't disclose: many of those conquests came without firing a shot.

The compromises and alliances have allowed al-Qaida militants to survive to fight another day — and risk strengthening the most dangerous branch of the terror network that carried out the 9/11 attacks.

Key participants in the pacts said the U.S. was aware of the arrangements and held off on any drone strikes as the al-Qaida fighters retreated in plain sight.

The AP's findings are based on reporting in Yemen and interviews with two dozen officials, including Yemeni security officers, militia commanders, tribal mediators and four members of al-Qaida's branch. All but a few of those sources spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals. Emirati-backed factions, like most armed groups in Yemen, have been accused of abducting or killing their critics.

The deals uncovered by the AP reflect the contradictory interests of the two wars being waged simultaneously in this southwestern corner of the Arabian Peninsula.

In one conflict, the U.S. is working with its Arab allies — particularly the United Arab Emirates — with the aim of eliminating the extremists known as Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP. But the larger mission is to win the civil war against the Houthis, Iranian-backed Shiite rebels. In that fight, al-Qaida is effectively on the same side as the coalition — and, by extension, the United States.

The U.S. has sent the coalition billions of dollars in weapons to fight the Houthis, and American jets provide air-to-air refueling for coalition war planes. The U.S. does not fund the coalition, however, and there is no evidence that American money went to AQAP militants.

""Elements of the U.S. military are clearly aware that much of what the U.S. is doing in Yemen is aiding AQAP and there is much angst about that,"" said Michael Horton, a fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, a U.S. analysis group that tracks terrorism.

But supporting allies against ""what the U.S. views as Iranian expansionism takes priority over battling AQAP and even stabilizing Yemen,"" Horton said.

The AP found that coalition-funded militia commanders actively recruit al-Qaida militants — considered to be exceptional fighters — or fighters who until very recently were members of the group.

Abdel-Sattar al-Shamiri, a former adviser to the governor of Taiz province, said he recognized al-Qaida's presence from the start and told commanders not to recruit members.

""Their response was, 'We will unite with the devil in the face of Houthis,'"" al-Shamiri said.

A militia commander in Taiz, known as Aboul Abbas, was put on the U.S. terrorism list for al-Qaida ties last year. But he continues to receive money from the UAE for his militia, his aide Adel al-Ezzi told the AP. Al-Ezzi rejected the U.S. accusation, denying any terrorism links. Soon after his comments, the AP saw him meeting with a known AQAP commander.

Another Taiz commander — Adnan Rouzek, who was recently given $12 million by Yemen's president for his fighting force — has a known al-Qaida figure as his closest aide.

The U.S. is aware of an al-Qaida presence among anti-Houthi ranks, a senior American official told reporters in Cairo earlier this year. Because coalition members back militias with hard-line Islamic commanders, ""it's very, very easy for al-Qaida to insinuate itself into the mix,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under the briefing's terms.

The Pentagon denied any complicity with al-Qaida.

""Since the beginning of 2017, we have conducted more than 140 strikes to remove key AQAP leaders and disrupt its ability to use ungoverned spaces to recruit, train and plan operations against the U.S. and our partners across the region,"" spokesman Navy Cmdr. Sean Robertson said in an email.

""Our regional partners have a proven track record of aggressively pursuing terrorist organizations and denying them safe haven in Yemen and DOD does not have any reason to doubt their resolve,"" he wrote.

The Saudi-led coalition commented by saying it ""continues its commitment to combat extremism and terrorism.""

The UAE did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

In early 2016, al-Qaida pulled out of the southern port city of Mukalla and seven areas in the nearby Abyan province, under deals reached with the UAE, according to five military, security and government officials and four tribal mediators involved in the Abyan arrangement.

That agreement included a provision that 10,000 local tribesmen — including 250 al-Qaida militants — would be incorporated into the Security Belt, the UAE-backed Yemeni force in the area, an al-Qaida negotiator and two Security Belt commanders said.

An accord for the withdrawal in February from the town of al-Said in Shabwa province went further, the AP found. The coalition promised payments to al-Qaida members who left, according to Shabwa's security chief Awad al-Dahboul, a mediator and two government officials.

Al-Dahboul said about 200 al-Qaida members received payments. He did not know the exact amounts, but said 100,000 Saudi rials ($26,000) were handed over to one al-Qaida leader in the presence of Emirati commanders.

Thousands of tribal fighters, including AQAP members, also were to be taken into the UAE-funded Shabwa Elite militia, the mediator and two officials said.

Al-Shamiri, the former official from Taiz, warned that the militants will be difficult to uproot after filtering into such roles. ""We will get rid of Houthis and we will be struck with terrorist groups.""

"An Indonesian man died on Friday after a coffin carrying the body of his mother fell from a stilt tower and crushed him to death, police said.

Samen Kondorura, 40, was killed after the coffin fell off the funeral tower during the service for his mother Berta Kondurara on the island of Sulawesi, The Guardian reported. Kondorura was serving as a pallbearer for his mother’s funeral when the other pallbearers carried it up a ladder to place on to a lakkian, “an ornately carved tower where the deceased is placed before elaborate traditional funeral rites.”

However, the staircase crumbled underneath the group's feet and the coffin fell off the lakkian as it was being raised on to the elevated tower, video showed. The coffin dropped about 10 feet and hit Kondorura.

“As the mother’s coffin was being raised to the lakkian, suddenly the ladder shifted and collapsed, the coffin fell and hit the victim,” Julianto Sirait, the chief police commissioner in the North Toraja district said.

Bystanders attempted to help the man but Kondorura died on his way to the hospital, NDTV reported.

"The Catholic Church’s pushback Sunday against Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, author of the bombshell accusation of a sex abuse cover-up against Pope Francis, has ensnared a key figure in the U.S. culture wars: Kim Davis.

The Rev. Federico Lombardi and his English-language assistant, the Rev. Thomas Rosica, issued a joint statement late Sunday disputing Viganò’s claims about the encounter he organized with Davis during Pope Francis’ September 2015 visit to the United States. Davis, of Rowan County, Kentucky, made headlines around the world after she cited her own faith to deny marriage licenses to gay couples.

The Vatican had sought to downplay the encounter after conservatives presented it as a papal stamp of approval for Davis.

However, Viganò, the papal ambassador — or nuncio — to Washington between 2011 and 2016, said in a statement last Thursday that Francis knew well who Davis was, and that the Vatican approved the meeting in advance.

Francis was so enraged that Davis’ supporters had leaked word of the meeting that the Vatican subsequently insisted he only held one private audience while there: with one of his former students, a gay man and his partner, as Fox News previously reported.

In the joint statement Sunday, Rosica transcribed what he said were handwritten notes from a meeting he and Lombardi had with Viganò after the Davis encounter. In those notes, Rosica quoted Viganò as telling them that the pope had actually chastised him for ""deceiving"" him with the Davis meeting, and for having withheld the fact that Davis had been married four times.

In his part of the joint statement, Lombardi said Viganò initiated the Davis meeting, should have known about the furor that it would cause, and that even though Vatican officials approved of it, they were not sufficiently informed about the significance such a meeting would take on.

The timing of Viganò’s accusations has been seen by the progressive pope’s supporters as a deliberate attempt by more conservative factions to undermine his tenure, which has seen him reach out to homosexuals and divorced parishioners.

In a damning 11-page letter released to ultra-conservative media in Europe last Sunday, during the pope’s trip to Ireland, Viganò called on the pope to resign, accusing him of being among Church hierarchy who knew — and did little or nothing — about rumored indiscretions by ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick.

In fact, Viganò asserted, McCarrick was rehabilitated from sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI, promoted and made part of high-profile Vatican events even as rumors about him swirled.

Coupled with the devastating allegations of sex abuse and cover-up in a recent Pennsylvania grand jury report — which found that 300 priests had abused more than 1,000 children over 70 years in six dioceses — the scandal has led to calls for heads to roll and for a full Vatican investigation into who knew what and when about McCarrick.

Francis accepted McCarrick’s resignation as cardinal last month, after the U.S. church investigation determined that an accusation he had sexually abused a minor was credible.

Since then, another man has come forward to say McCarrick began molesting him starting when he was 11, and several former seminarians have said McCarrick abused and harassed them when they were in seminary. The accusations have created a crisis of confidence in the U.S. and Vatican hierarchy, because it was apparently an open secret that McCarrick regularly invited seminarians to his New Jersey beach house, and into his bed.

"President Trump on Monday accused Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of advocating “harm” against his supporters, after she called over the weekend for protesters to confront Cabinet members wherever they see them in public.

“Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!” Trump tweeted.

The president’s tweet comes after Waters, D-Calif., urged her supporters to accost Trump administration officials.

“If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere,” Waters said, later telling MSNBC that protesters are “going to absolutely harass them.”

Despite Trump's attempt to link Waters to Pelosi, the House Democratic leader seemed to distance herself from her California colleague's remarks, calling for ""unity"" on Twitter.

""In the crucial months ahead, we must strive to make America beautiful again. Trump’s daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable. As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea,"" Pelosi tweeted.

Waters’ comments follow several incidents where Trump administration officials were confronted at or kicked out of restaurants amid last week's backlash over family separations at the border.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was asked to leave Lexington, Va., restaurant The Red Hen on Friday. Sanders confirmed she was told to leave by the owner because she worked for the president.

Earlier last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was confronted at a Mexican restaurant by left-wing activists protesting family separations.

President Trump sought to address the controversy last week when he signed an executive order ending the practice of separating illegal immigrant families caught crossing the border. But the backlash has persisted, with protesters calling on the administration to curb detentions and more.

But the threats of more confrontation have raised security concerns and questions over whether a line is being crossed—separating legitimate political protest from outright harassment.

Waters’ comments drew a strong rebuke from Republican lawmakers amid fears that the protests might escalate. A spokesman for House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who was injured in the shooting at a congressional baseball practice just over a year ago, warned about the dangers of overheated rhetoric and protests.

“Whip Scalise knows firsthand the dangerous consequences that can result from making political differences personal and vitriolic,” spokeswoman Lauren Fine said in a statement. “We are lucky to live in a country where we have the right to freely debate our differences civilly. Harassment is never an acceptable method of disagreement.”

On Saturday, Florida Attorney General – and ardent Trump supporter – Pam Bondi was confronted by a group of protesters outside the screening of a documentary about Mister Rogers in Tampa. A video of the confrontation shows the Florida AG leaving the theater as several people yell at her, with one woman seen shouting at her about Bondi’s recent actions on health care policy and her stance on immigration.

But Bondi told “Fox & Friends” on Monday that the harassment began as she waited in line for tickets and continued inside the theater.

“If [Waters] wants people to protest that’s one thing, but they are trying to start a fight,” Bondi said. “I’m not going to change my life, that’s what they want.”

"The Republican Party faces an uphill climb in the Nov. 6 elections. The party in the White House historically loses seats in midterm voting – and with majorities in both houses of Congress to protect, the GOP needs to work overtime.

Continue Reading Below

So far, we have seen Republican candidates overcome the historical midterm narrative. Despite the liberal establishment’s best efforts, Republicans have won seven out of the last nine special elections since President Trump took office. One race in Ohio for a U.S. House seat is still undecided until all provisional ballots are reviewed and absentee ballots are counted – but Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson holds a narrow lead.

Ahead of the midterms, it’s hard not to be turned off by the constant barrage of negative news and the feeling that Washington just isn’t working. But what’s often lost in the deluge of news coverage are the hundreds of reforms and effective solutions that are being championed and passed by this Republican Congress. In the past 20 months, the House of Representatives has passed more than 700 bills.

These solutions, reforms and pro-American policies are responsible for our booming economy and low unemployment numbers. There are currently more job openings than there are job seekers in the United States.

Families from California to Maine have felt the positive effects of our robust economic growth and increased opportunity for all. Republicans should be doubling down on our policies that have delivered lower taxes, a growing economy and near record-low unemployment.

But what many Americans haven’t heard about are the other solutions championed by the Republican Congress that make real, tangible improvements to our lives. These are solutions that improve our security and make sure our laws are keeping up with the challenges that we face.

Policies supported by Republicans in Congress put patients first. They improve access to health care and treatment for those who are facing illness, struggling with addiction or caring for aging or disabled loved ones.

These are all priorities championed and supported by members of the Republican Main Street Partnership . But chances are you haven’t heard much about them yet.

President Trump signed legislation into law in January that supports the more than 40 million family members making countless personal and financial sacrifices to care for their aging or disabled loved ones. The law provides the recognition, resources and training these people need to balance the full-time job of caregiving with everything else that life brings.

House Republicans passed the Stop School Violence Act in March. And they included resources in this year’s government funding bill to help identify threats and prevent violence from taking place on school grounds. By giving funding and resources to local schools, America’s superintendents, teachers and parents can determine what methods can be implemented to keep their kids safe.

The Right to Try Act, signed into law by President Trump in May, allows terminally ill patients to access experimental treatments that could potentially prolong – or save – their lives.

And more than 50 bills addressing the growing opioid epidemic passed in June. This legislation is designed to reduce the over-prescription of opioid painkillers, create better prescription guidelines for medical professionals, protect seniors from opioid dependence and overuse, and improve access to non-addictive pain medication and treatment.

We recently shared these policies and legislative accomplishments with Republican moms and swing voters in Colorado, Florida, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. These groups of voters are critical voting blocs for the GOP ahead of the November elections.

Unsurprisingly, when asked how familiar the groups were with the statements that were shared, on a scale from 1-10 the average response was a 4. But when asked how likely they would be to vote for or re-elect a member of Congress who championed those policies and made the statements that were shared, the average response was an 8.

From these conversations it became clear that recent Republican accomplishments are loved but remain largely unknown. Facing a 24/7 news cycle, these messages become muddled and aren’t breaking through to those who are open to listening.

From now until November, Republican Main Street Partnership members will be highlighting these accomplishments and policies that Republicans have championed to improve the lives of families, workers and patients nationwide.

Voters are listening, and they’re expecting results from their representatives. Republicans have delivered – and now keeping our majorities in the House and Senate depends on showcasing this success to the American people.",politics
"The State Department announced Thursday that it has “credible information” that Russian officials are working with the Syrian government to delay a U.S. investigation into chemical attack sites in order to “sanitize” and “remove incriminating evidence.”

Spokeswoman Heather Nauert confirmed that officials from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have yet to be allowed into Douma to inspect the area where they say a poison gas attack hit on April 7.

“We can confirm that the OPCW team has still not been able to enter Douma in Syria. It is now 12 days since the attack took place on men, women and children and those innocent civilians in Syria.”

She also said that evidence is pointing towards Russia and Syria for the delay, adding that they may be trying to conduct a “staged investigation.”

“We have credible information that indicates that Russian officials are working with the Syrian regime to deny and to delay these inspectors from gaining access to Douma,” Nauert said. “Russian officials have worked with the Syrian regime, we believe, to sanitize the location of those suspected attacks and remove incriminating evidence of chemical weapons used.”

The State Department also confirmed that individuals have been pressured by the two governments to change their stories “so that it doesn’t appear that Russia and Syria are responsible for those attacks.”

“The longer that those sites are not able to be investigated by the OPCW fact finding mission experts, the more that the evidence can certainly deteriorate and that’s a great concern to us. We also believe that it gives them additional time to try and clean up and sanitize those sites.”

The State Department could not say if those attempts to “sanitize” were successful, but it did say that there is a chance that the investigation could be compromised by the time officials get to those sites.

U.S. and French authorities say that the poison gas attack, which killed at least 40 people and injured more than 500, was the work of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

In response to the attack, President Trump, along with the U.K. and France, launched a series of military strikes that successfully targeted three locations that made up the heart of Assad’s weapons program.

Syrian and Russian officials have denied any such attacks and have even claimed that evidence of a chemical weapons attack was fabricated by the West.

“We certainly know that Syria is responsible for those attacks,” Nauret said.

"A California city councilwoman fired back against critics who released photos of her engaging in “lascivious, drunk and drug-addled behavior” at the Burning Man festival and threatened to post more if she didn’t pull out of November’s council race.

Rachel Hundley, a former mayor of the Sonoma city where she’s running for the position on the city council, released a video slamming the threats from “spineless individuals” who tried to blackmail her with her pictures from Burning Man, an arts and music festival in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, where she is allegedly seen wearing only a bra and underwear.

She accused the blackmailers of “slut shaming” and insisted she never considered giving in to their demands. The recorded video addressing the situation was posted online by the campaign.

“I realized there were two paths I could take,” Hundley told the San Francisco Chronicle. “I could continue with the campaign and ignore it all, or I could acknowledge that this is something that happens to women all over the country, and is something we should talk about.”

Hundley admitted that she has attended Burning Man and served wines from her city at a bar at a “consent-focused sex-positive theme camp” at the festival.

“What was especially disturbing in this era of Me Too was the attempt to slut shame me for celebrating my body and for my attendance at Burning Man,” she said in the video.

The candidate added that the now-disabled website “Rachel Hundley Exposed,” which called Hundley a “cruel and demented person” and “a cancer” in the city, was created to force her to withdraw from the race and “to make me afraid, to silence another strong female voice by scaring me out of this election and denying you the right to make a choice.”

It remains unclear who created the website as it was anonymized and signed only by “Sonoma Citizens for Peace and Cooperation.” She said the email from the attackers told her that unless she drops out of the race, more incriminating information will be posted online.

But Hundley said much of the information on the website is fabricated, giving an example of a woman smoking weed through a bong, which wasn’t actually her.

“This is a volunteer position, it takes a lot of time,” she told the Chronicle about the councilwoman’s position. “The website not only hurt me but hurt my family. I did consider the weight of it. But this is something I enjoy doing and want to do for another four years.”",politics
"The United States and Mexico look close to resolving key differences on the North American Free Trade Agreement and may have a complete deal worked out by as early as Monday, according to sources close to the talks.

Three people familiar with the progress told Bloomberg that there have been significant breakthroughs over the past few days on issues ranging from automobiles to energy, although it is unclear if any of the progress will be made public as Mexico’s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo has said the country won’t make an announcement on NAFTA until Canada also signs on to a new deal.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Sunday morning that the administration has “no announcements or anything finalized at this time,” despite President Trump’s enthusiastic tweet on Saturday that there could be a “big Trade Agreement” soon.

“Our relationship with Mexico is getting closer by the hour,” Trump tweeted. “Some really good people within both the new and old government, and all working closely together....A big Trade Agreement with Mexico could be happening soon!”

Despite Trump’s oftentimes contentious relationship with Mexico, his administration and that of outgoing Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto have been working for the past five weeks to iron out their bilateral differences so Canada can rejoin the talks to update NAFTA. Both countries want to finalize an agreement this month so that it can be signed ahead of Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s inauguration in December.

One of the biggest issues on the negotiating table deals with car manufacturing jobs, as the Trump administration pushes for a deal that would boost factory employment in the U.S.

The U.S. on Thursday agreed to keep the 2.5 percent tariff currently applied under World Trade Organization rules if the cars are made at factories that already exist, which leaves open the possibility that automobiles that are built at new plants could face tariffs of 20 percent to 25 percent.

Trump has also signaled that he is open to negotiating trade deals with Mexico and Canada separately, while both countries have said they want to keep the three-nation trade deal that dates back to 1994.

Earlier in August, Trump threatened Canada with auto tariffs if the U.S. and Canada can't forge a deal.

""Canada must wait,"" Trump tweeted. ""Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high. Will tax cars if we can't make a deal!""

Canada responded with a statement Friday night, saying: ""Our focus is unchanged. We'll keep standing up for Canadian interests as we work toward a modernized trilateral NAFTA agreement.""

Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canada's foreign minister, added: ""We're glad Mexico and the U.S. continue to work out their bilateral issues. It's the only way we'll get to a deal.""

"Adult film star Stormy Daniels came to the defense of First Lady Melania Trump over the weekend, saying “people should stop speaking for her” and making speculations about her feelings.

Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, told the British tabloid The Mirror: “Everything we say about her is a projection. Some people misplace sorrow and pity on another person,” while noting that maybe the first lady is “happy.”

The media has drummed up rumors and conjecture regarding the first lady’s feelings toward her marriage with President Donald Trump since she was thrusted into the national spotlight during the 2016 presidential election.

“The entire world would be interested to know what she feels,” Daniels told the outlet. “But if we never know, that is her right and I support it.”

Daniels is suing the president and his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen over a nondisclosure agreement she signed to keep mum about an alleged affair she claims to have had with Trump in 2006.

Trump has denied the accusation.

Omarosa Manigault-Newman claimed in her tell-all book “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House,” that Melania Trump wants a divorce when he is out of office, among other accusations against the first lady.

"The California Supreme Court on Wednesday blocked a proposal that would split the state into three from the November ballot.

The court wrote that it took the step “because significant questions have been raised regarding the proposition’s validity and because we conclude that the potential harm in permitting the measure to remain on the ballot outweighs the potential harm in delaying the proposition to a future election.”

Last week, an environmental group sued to have the measure removed from the ballot. To substantially alter the state's governance under the California constitution, the group argued, a constitutional convention would need to be called -- and that requires a supermajority of both houses of the state's legislature.

A ballot initiative, the group said, was constitutionally insufficient.

“In seeking to remove this initiative from the ballot, we are asking the court to protect the integrity of both the initiative process and our state constitution,” Carlyle Hall, an attorney representing the environmental group, the Planning and Conservation League, said in a statement. “Proponents should not be able to evade the state constitution simply by qualifying a measure as one thing, when it is so clearly another.”

The California Supreme Court has held that while amendments to the California state constitution through ballot measures are appropriate, more significant ""revisions"" of the constitution require action from the legislature. For a measure to count as a ""revision,"" the California Supreme Court has ruled, it ""must necessarily or inevitably appear from the face of the challenged provision that the measure will substantially alter the basic governmental framework set forth in our Constitution.”

WATCH: THE EFFORT TO SPLIT CALIFORNIA IN 3 EXPLAINED

But the sponsor of the “Cal 3” initiative to split California into three states -- in the name of increased government efficiency -- asked the state's Supreme Court last week to dismiss the lawsuit calling for the proposal to be pulled from the November ballot.

Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who spent more than $1.7 million supporting the initiative, told the court in a letter that there wasn't enough time to properly consider the legal challenge to his effort.

He also claimed the measure was appropriate for the ballot process, and claimed splitting up California would make the state easier and more efficient to govern.

""I have been given just a day or two to respond to a complex, multi-faceted attack on my Constitutional right to initiative,"" Draper wrote. ""This Court's long history of jealously guarding the exercise of initiative power should not be cavalierly disregarded now, especially on such a truncated timetable.""

The court was under pressure to decide the issue quickly, because the California November ballot reportedly was set to go to the printer in early August.

Wednesday's order is not a final ruling on the constitutionality of the ballot measure, but experts said the judges would not have removed the measure from the ballot if they did not feel strongly that it was unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court said it will determine the merits of the measure's constitutionality in the future.

Passing at the ballot box would have just been the first hurdle for the initiative. The measure, after passage, then would direct the governor to ask the U.S. Congress for the ultimate approval to split the state into three — likely a tall order.

"Robert Wilkie has served as acting secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs since March — and now his position is permanent.

On July 23, the Senate confirmed Wilkie to lead the VA, the government's second-largest department, with 360,000 employees serving 9 million veterans.



Wilkie, 55, has led the department since Trump announced his decision to replace David Shulkin. Then, Trump said he intended to nominate presidential physician, Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, to lead Veterans Affairs, but Jackson eventually withdrew his name from consideration following controversy.

Read on for a look at four things to know about the Wilkie.

He served in the Air Force and Navy

Wilkie served in the United States Naval Reserve, according to his Defense Department biography.

He would later join the Air Force as a reserve officer and was assigned to the Office of the Chief of Staff, his biography said.

He holds a masters in strategic studies from the United States Army War College. Wilkie is also a graduate of Wake Forest University, Georgetown University and Loyola University in New Orleans.

He is also the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness

Wilkie took over as Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness in November 2017. According to his Defense Department biography, he advises the Secretary of Defense for Total Force Management on the National Guard, training, health issues and personnel requirements.

WHO’S IN TRUMP’S CABINET? A FULL LIST OF THE PRESIDENT’ STOP ADVISERS

In 2005, Wilkie was tapped to serve as assistant secretary of the Defense Department. He was the youngest senior leader in the department at the time, his biography states.

He worked for a massive engineering firm

Wilkie was vice president for strategic programs for CH2M HILL, a global engineering company, from 2010 to 2015, according to the Raleigh News & Observer.

Some of his assignments included reforming the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense Supply and Logistics System, his biography explains.

Wilkie also worked on the Hill

Wilkie worked for Sen. Trent Lott, then the Majority Leader, from 1997 to 2003, according to the News & Observer. He also served as an aide to former Sen. Jesse Helms and former Rep. David Funderburk.

Additionally, Wilkie was executive director of the North Carolina GOP, the newspaper reported.

In 1996, Wilkie unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Congress, the News & Observer reported.",politics
"Alice Marie Johnson, the woman whose life sentence was commuted by President Trump last month, called America “a country of second chances,” and said that she believes Trump will “follow up” with more situations like hers.

Speaking to Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Johnson shared her experience since being released on June 6.

“Every single place that I go, if people recognize who I am, they hug me. They tell me how happy they are that I’m home,” she said. “They tell me how much they were praying for me, and how they followed from the day Kim went to the White House.”

Johnson, 63, had been serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole after she was convicted of a first-time nonviolent drug offense and charges related to money laundering. Reality TV icon Kim Kardashian West took up her case, even meeting with Trump at the White House to plead for clemency.

She said that the most difficult part of her journey was the time spent hoping for a chance to be released.

“The waiting has been very painful for me and my family. We’ve had so many ups and downs. So many false alarms that it was going to happen for years.”

Johnson said that her case is proof that the “system is broken,” but she added that she has faith after being granted clemency by Trump.

“I won’t let him down, there is no way. This country is a country of second chances,” she said on “Hannity.” “I love America, and I believe that as the president sees what has taken place with me, that he is going to follow up and do some other things for other people.”

Johnson also expressed her thanks to West, who has said she is working hard to help others.

“I am so happy that Kim is staying focused, because there are so many others just like me.”

West recently turned down the opportunity to join in Hollywood’s Trump bashing in an appearance with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.

She repeatedly brushed off Kimmel’s remarks aimed at Trump, at one point saying she is “hopeful” that more will come from their meeting at the White House, and that she has “nothing bad to say about the president.”",politics
"Organizers of a long-running initiative to secure California’s secession from the United States now say they want to give away nearly half of the state, including all of its federal land, to form an “autonomous Native American nation.”

“Calexit,” as the proposal for California’s secession is known, was given the green light by the state government earlier this year to begin collecting signatures to place the measure on the November ballot. Advocates had until mid-October to gather 365,880 signatures of registered voters to put it up for a statewide vote.

But the revamp announced by Calexit’s founders on Tuesday adds an additional objective: constructing “the first ever autonomous Native American nation in North America,” by giving Native Americans all federal lands in the state, running from the border with Mexico to the state boundary shared with Oregon.

“Why not do something to right some of the wrongs of the past to the Native American people, and give them back their land?” Calexit co-founder Louis J. Marinelli said Tuesday.

Because most of the federal land would include conservative-leaning portions of California, the plan also would create a “buffer zone between Donald Trump’s America and the new independent California Republic,” another co-founder of the initiative, Marcus Ruiz Evans, said in a statement.

Speaking to Fox News, Marinelli said the plan wouldn’t be unduly disruptive to Californians.

“It will have a minimal impact on the California population, two-thirds of which lives in a county on California’s shore,” Marinelli said.

He added that Calexit organizers will continue their fight even if Democrats make big gains in the upcoming midterm elections.

“Our campaign is not motivated by the shifting balance of political power in Washington,” Marinelli said in an email. “We are motivated by the fact that California is a distinct society with the capability to govern itself independent of a country whose values are in direct conflict with ours, and a country whose government system [and its institutions] is broken and obsolete.”

On July 4, Calexit staged a rally at the state capitol in Sacramento, calling on Trump supporters to “get out” of the state, and decrying the American “occupation” of California.

“The Fourth of July is no longer a day to celebrate in California,” the campaign said in an Independence Day statement.

Calexit is distinct from a parallel effort sponsored by venture capitalist Tim Draper to split California into three states, known as “Cal 3,” in the name of increased government efficiency.

Draper, a Stanford and Harvard-educated billionaire, received media attention — and a major windfall — four years ago by purchasing bitcoins seized by the government at auction. He had garnered more than 600,000 signatures to have his initiative placed on the November ballot, prior to its removal by the state’s highest court. His libertarian-leaning views defy simple partisan characterization: Bloomberg has described Draper’s political evolution as a journey from “Democrat to Republican to Libertarian to, well, his own party.”

CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DEALS MAJOR BLOW TO CAL 3, REMOVES IT FROM NOVEMBER BALLOT

The California Supreme Court earlier this month blocked the Cal 3 proposal from the November ballot, saying it was too significant a change to the state’s structure to be undertaken by a ballot initiative. Instead, the court ruled, the state’s constitution required action by the legislature.

The July ruling was a setback for Calexit’s organizers, because a similar objection could be made to their proposal to divide large portions of the state.

Calexit’s founders also have expressed frustration that voters sometimes had confused Calexit for Cal 3.

There have been multiple efforts in the past for California to break away from the rest of America. They have either been withdrawn or failed to gather the signatures required to advance.

But enthusiasm for such measures has grown in recent years. A 2014 Reuters poll showed that only 20 percent of Californians wanted to secede; in 2017, after Trump’s election, the number grew to 32 percent.

Marinelli told Fox News he is well-aware that many conservatives support California leaving the rest of the country.

“We would love to see official numbers on nationwide support for Calexit,” he said, adding that, “on a constant basis ... people [are] emailing how they want California to secede, or as they put it: break off and fall into the ocean.”",politics
"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Monday accused an Oregon mayor of violating the Constitution after emboldening “Abolish ICE” protesters by ordering the police to stand down and openly expressing support for their cause.

The accusations were outlined in a cease-and-desist letter sent to Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, saying he actively encouraged the protesters and their cause, while making sure Portland’s police wouldn’t crack down on them, thus creating “a zone of terror and lawlessness,” the Washington Times reported.

“When the mayor gave the order that police would not support ICE employees trapped in the facility, he turned the lives of our employees over to an angry mob,” Chris Crane, president of the National ICE Council, the organization that sent the cease-and-desist letter, told the newspaper.

The letter demands Wheeler to make an apology and ensure the city’s police will protect all citizens in need, including those working for a federal agency. A letter advises that the city could be sued if the mayor’s response isn’t adequate.

“The mayor stated publicly that he supported the protests, which were supposed to be about protecting immigrant families. But what about the moms and dads that we had working in that building? What about their kids?” Crane continued. “These are questions that we’ll be expecting the mayor and city of Portland to be answering in the days to come.”

PORTLAND ICE FACILITY PROTEST CAMP BROKEN UP BY FEDS AS CROWDS SHOUT ‘NOT RACIST POLICE!’

Portland is among the main centers of the nationwide movement to abolish the federal immigration authority, an idea that is increasingly being embraced by top mainstream Democrats in Congress, including U.S. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

The city mayor’s support for the movement led to the occupation of a building being used by ICE, harassment of some ICE employees, and the creation of a camp on a city’s land.

“To all demonstrators: I urge you to keep up this effort,” Wheeler said in a press conference last week, according to The Oregonian, though advising protesters to vacate the ICE field office and the camp before the police disbands them.

He also said that the encampment, which has been branded as a biohazard by authorities, “deters from the main message” of getting rid of the immigration agency.

ICE officers alleged that some agency employees were denied assistance from the police to deal with protesters, including a disabled Marine veteran who was allegedly confronted by an activist as he was picking up his daughter from a camp.

According to the Times, the veteran was interning at the ICE office on the first day of the demonstrations against the agency. After the demonstrators surrounded the ICE field office, he managed to escape but his car was scratched and tires slashed. He was later allegedly followed by the activists, yet his calls for help were reportedly ignored by the police, who told him that they are staying out of the situation.

""When it comes to basic police protection that should transcend politics ... It comes down to life and death. [Mayor Wheeler] was irresponsible.” - ICE Agent

“When it comes to basic police protection that should transcend politics,” another ICE employee said about the veteran’s experience, blaming the city’s mayor. “It comes down to life and death. He was irresponsible.”

The President of the National ICE Council urged the Trump administration to do more to defend the federal immigration agency.

“For now, a handful of ICE officers and staff are taking this mayor and city on all by ourselves,” he told the Times. “We’ll fight alone for the rule of law and safety of our employees nationwide if that’s what it takes, but someone on our side would be a welcome change moving forward.”",politics
"Maybe it's John Bolton clutching a gun. Maybe it's Mike Pompeo setting down his binoculars to stare into the distance. Maybe it's the gators.

But a newly unveiled painting meant to depict President Trump and his team navigating the Washington ""swamp"" has something for everyone.

Utah-based artist Jon McNaughton touched off a social media frenzy as he shared his painting, “Crossing the Swamp,” Tuesday on Twitter. The painting is a riff on the classic “Washington Crossing the Delaware,” only it replaces George Washington's crew with members of the Trump administration.

“My new painting—‘Crossing the Swamp’ ‘Never give up. Never lower your light. Never stop till the swamp is dry,’” McNaughton tweeted.

The painting shows Trump at the helm, and Vice President Pence carrying the flag by his side.

McNaughton identifies the rest as: U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley; Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson; Attorney General Jeff Sessions; first lady Melania Trump; Secretary of State Pompeo; White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders; the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump; National Security Adviser Bolton; Kellyanne Conway; and Chief of Staff John Kelly.

McNaughton is a Trump supporter, hashtagging “MAGA” on his Twitter bio.

“Trump endeavors to cross the ‘swamp’ of Washington DC as he carries the light of truth, hope, and prosperity. The murky water of the deep state is laced with dangerous vermin, perfectly willing to destroy American prosperity for their personal ideologies and financial gain,” McNaughton said of his latest painting on his website.

McNaughton also wrote that he hopes people will “study the paintings and try to understand the deeper meaning.”

No matter how earnest the artist's intentions, the painting quickly became Twitter fodder as users seized on a variety of quirky aspects.

Observations included:

""Ben Carson appears to be rowing backwards.""

""They are literally rowing in a circle.""

""Pretty sure Pruitt took the cruise line route.""

""Looks like Jr. didn’t make the boat.""

Twitter can be cruel.

McNaughton has several other paintings on his website about the Trump administration. One, titled “Make America Safe,” depicts Trump standing in front of a white picket fence with an open lock, holding a key, and the American flag waving in the background.

Another, titled “Respect the Flag,” shows Trump on a football field, hugging a ripped flag, seemingly referencing the president’s battle with the National Football League over players kneeling during the National Anthem.",politics
"An Oregon congressional candidate is facing intense criticism after he published a ""disgraceful"" tweet regarding first lady Melania Trump.

In response to another tweet comparing the amount of staff Trump has employed as first lady compared with Michelle Obama, Mark Roberts — who's running as an independent — asked, “Did you know the First Lady works by the hour?” He included two vulgar hashtags.

When another Twitter user pointed out Trump had successfully sued the Daily Mail for a story on unfounded rumors about the first lady, he used another vulgar term.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., flagged the first tweet to Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and urged that Roberts be “banned” from the social media site.

“This attack on [the first lady] is disgraceful. Comments like these have no business on any platform,” McCarthy tweeted. “This account should be banned ASAP.”

Roberts, who calls himself an ""independent conservative,"" is facing incumbent Rep. Greg Walden, a Republican, and Jamie McLeod-Skinner, a Democrat, in Oregon’s 2nd congressional district.

Roberts revealed he's “not a fan of the Trump administration,” but added that he does “find values and opportunities within it that are redeeming,” especially when it comes to conservation and forestry efforts.",politics
"A jury has been seated in the high-stakes trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, with opening statements set to begin as early as Tuesday afternoon.

Jury selection moved swiftly as the trial kicked off at a federal courthouse in northern Virginia, refocusing the special counsel probe for at least the next several weeks on the veteran operative’s alleged tax evasion and eye-popping spending habits – but not Russia’s 2016 election meddling.

The jury is composed of six men and six women, with four alternates.

Manafort, who arrived early in the morning in a grey van with tinted windows, wore a suit and was seated with his lawyers.

Judge T.S. Ellis III instructed the pool of roughly 75 potential jurors earlier Tuesday that “nothing is more important than jury duty as an American.”

The trial is the first arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. It represents a major test not just for Manafort, who faces decades in prison on bank and tax fraud charges if convicted, but also for Mueller, whose ongoing probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election could lose credibility if jurors ultimately acquit Manafort.

The Mueller team in Alexandria is being led by Andrew Weissmann, whose specialties included fraud and organized crime before Mueller enlisted him. Manafort’s defense team is led by Kevin Downing.

President Trump repeatedly has called the Mueller probe a ""witch hunt,"" and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has suggested the investigation is ""rigged.""

Neither the Virginia trial nor Manafort's separate upcoming trial in Washington, D.C., directly relates to any alleged collusion between Trump officials and the Russian government, or purported Russian disinformation campaigns -- a fact that led to a tense courtroom showdown just months ago.

The judge in the case harshly rebuked members of Mueller's team in a preliminary hearing in May, saying they were pursuing the case against the ex-Trump adviser as a means to target the president.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE MANAFORT TRIAL

""You don't really care about Mr. Manafort,"" Ellis told prosecutors. ""You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever.""

Prosecutor Greg Andres flatly told the judge: ""I don’t anticipate that a government witness will utter the word 'Russia.'""

But Ellis ultimately allowed the case to proceed, saying the prosecution fell within Mueller's broad authority to investigate Russian involvement in U.S. politics.

On Tuesday, jurors were told that all the charges against Manafort are financial in nature.

The trial, which is expected to last about three weeks, centers on accusations that Manafort intentionally hid millions of dollars he earned from the Ukrainian government and oligarchs to lobby on behalf of since-deposed pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych.

Prosecutors say they will show that Manafort failed to report a ""significant percentage"" of the nearly $60 million in income from his Ukraine work on his tax returns, and did not properly indicate that he maintained bank accounts in foreign countries.

WITNESS LIST GIVES GLIMPSE AT MANAFORT TRIAL STRATEGY

They also alleged that Manafort committed bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy in several instances.

Rick Gates, Manafort's former business partner, pleaded guilty earlier this year in the probe and cut a deal with prosecutors. He is one of 35 witnesses that the Mueller team said it may call during the trial.

Other witnesses Mueller has signaled may testify include those with information about Manafort's allegedly lavish spending habits. Five potential witnesses were offered and granted immunity in the case, including former Manafort accountants.

Manafort has been held in solitary confinement for alleged witness tampering by the judge in his pending D.C. trial, Judge Amy Berman Jackson. Manafort's attorneys have said his confinement has been unnecessary and unduly harsh, and has impeded his ability to communicate with his defense team.

Observers have questioned whether Trump will pardon Manafort if he is convicted. Trump has said he feels ""badly"" about Manafort's situation, and that he considers it unfair that he has been ensnared by Mueller's probe.

"President Trump gave hearty endorsements to Florida Gov. Rick Scott and U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis Tuesday as two of the state's top Republican elected officials seek higher office in November's midterm elections.

""I don't do these endorsements easily,"" Trump told an enthusiastic crowd during his rally at Tampa's Florida State Fairgrounds. ""I don't need to be here, but I happen to love this state.""

The rally took place with four weeks to go before the Aug. 28 Republican gubernatorial primary, in which DeSantis will face off against state Agricultural Commissioner Adam Putnam.

Trump touted the congressman as ""a true leader"", ""a proud veteran"", ""my great friend"" and predicted: ""he's going to be your next governor.""

""I appreciate your support, Mr. President,"" DeSantis said after Trump called him up on stage. ""But I appreciate more the leadership you're showing for our great country.""

Trump also implored supporters to back Scott against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who he said was ""[Chuck] Schumer-controlled, [and] Nancy Pelosi-controlled,"" referring to the Senate and House Democratic leaders.

""You know, I live a lot of time in Florida,"" Trump said. ""The only time I see Bill Nelson is five months before every election. And after a while, you forget: 'Who's the senator?' But around five months, you see him at parties and you see him around ... We have to make sure that Rick Scott wins and wins big.""

The speech was notable for Trump's emphatic call to implement stricter voter ID requirements in apparent response to some cities giving illegal immigrants the right to vote in certain elections.

""Only American citizens should vote in American elections,"" Trump said. ""Which is why the time has come for voter ID, like everything else.

""You know, if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card."" Trump claimed. ""You go out and you want to buy anything, you need ID and you need your picture.""

""In this country, the only time you don’t need it, in many cases, is when you want to vote for a president, when you want to vote for a senator, when you want to vote for a governor or a congressman. It’s crazy.""

Trump also publicly pondered the idea of talking to Iran's leaders, one day after saying he'd meet them without preconditions.

""I hope it works out well with Iran. They’re having a lot of difficulty right now,"" he said in an aside. ""I hope it works out well. And I have a feeling they’ll be talking to us pretty soon. And maybe not, and that’s OK, too.""

The Florida gubernatorial contest is the latest GOP primary into which Trump has injected himself, having previously helped candidates in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina with endorsements that have helped set the stage for the fall elections.

RON DESANTIS TEACHES HIS KIDS ABOUT TRUMP IN CAMPAIGN AD

Last month, Trump endorsed DeSantis, saying that he would be ""strong on borders, tough on crime [and] big on cutting taxes.""

Florida represented a crucial triumph for Trump in the 2016 presidential election and the president has maintained a steady presence in the state, returning frequently to his winter home in Palm Beach.

""We are restoring American strength and American pride,"" Trump said. ""But to continue this incredible momentum, this incredible movement ... we need to elect more Republicans. We need more votes.""

Appearing at a technical school in Tampa earlier Tuesday, Trump praised the strength of the economy, telling students and faculty members there was never a better time to learn new skills and gain employment. He was joined by Scott, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump and several members of Congress from Florida.

DeSantis has tied his campaign for governor directly to Trump, even teaching one of his two children to ""build the wall"" with blocks in a recent campaign ad.

Putnam, a former congressman, has run a more traditional campaign for governor, barnstorming the state with campaign events aimed at building upon his family's deep ties to the state.

"President Trump has asked John Kelly to stay on as White House chief of staff through 2020, multiple sources told Fox News on Tuesday.

The move comes as Kelly marked one year at the White House -- an anniversary that prompted inevitable speculation about whether he will stay or go. The Associated Press reports that Kelly has told staffers he has agreed to stay on.

Kelly was brought on in July 2017 to impose order on a chaotic West Wing, replacing Reince Priebus.

The former Homeland Security secretary and Marine Corps general made swift changes in both personnel and protocol, limiting the once-freewheeling environment surrounding the president.

But his standing in the White House has been somewhat diminished in recent months.

Trump has at times sounded out allies about potential replacements, and Kelly has told people he’d be happy if he made it to the one-year mark.

Yet Trump marked the occasion during an Oval Office swearing-in ceremony for the new secretary of Veterans Affairs on Monday.

And he tweeted a picture of the two of them smiling, side by side, with the message:

""Congratulations to General John Kelly. Today we celebrate his first full year as @WhiteHouse Chief of Staff!""

"The federal judge presiding over the fraud trial of ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort rebuked Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team repeatedly on Wednesday, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in the first prosecution arising out of Mueller's ongoing Russia probe.

The 78-year-old Reagan-appointed judge, T.S. Ellis, sent jurors out of the courtroom several times as he reminded prosecutors that Manafort is not on trial for simply having a ""lavish lifestyle.""

Ellis also surprised the courtroom late Wednesday when he said, ""I’m hoping to finish this case much sooner than anyone predicted.”

The trial had been expected to last three weeks. Earlier in the day, prosecutors told the judge they thought the government could wrap its case by the end of next week.

Prosecutors have introduced a bevy of exhibits and are in the process of calling several witnesses as part of their effort to paint Manafort as a tax scofflaw who failed to report money spent on luxury items -- then lied to get bank loans when his foreign consulting work dried up.

But the Mueller team was rebuffed by Ellis when it tried to introduce photos of Manafort’s closets, filled with suits and other high-end articles of clothing. Ellis noted that those photos would eventually become fodder for the media, and called them ""unnecessary"" for jurors to see.

“Enough is enough. We don’t convict people because they have a lot of money and throw it around,” he said.

He also dismissed an exhibit related to Manafort's lavish spending: ""All this document shows is that Mr. Manafort had a lavish lifestyle,"" Ellis said. ""It isn't relevant.""

The legal standard for excluding evidence based on irrelevance or the risk of prejudicing jurors is high -- ordinarily, judges only prevent jurors from seeing evidence that has no tendency to make any fact at issue in the case more or less likely, or that would pose a substantial risk of unfairly arousing juror bias.

The prosecution was able to present some evidence of Manafort's spending on Wednesday. One witness, Ron Wall, the chief financial officer of high-end men's apparel store House of Bijan in Beverly Hills, Calif., testified that Manafort spent a grand total of $334,325 over a three-year period at the store.

That included one invoice for an assortment of clothing in 2010, at a total of roughly $128,000. Wall testified that most of those payments came from wire transfers from banks in Cyprus -- but he admitted on cross-examination by defense attorneys that he has other clients who similarly use wire transfers for costly items.

Another witness, Steve Jacobson, a contractor hired by Manafort from 2010 to 2014, said he worked on a number of the defendant's properties, including one in Trump Tower. That is the first time jurors heard Trump's name uttered in the trial.

Jacobson said most of the nearly $3.3 million Manafort paid him in that period came by way of international wire transfers. The parties also stipulated that a payment for daughter Andrea’s house in Arlington came in the form of a $1.9 million wire transfer from a Cyprus bank.

Among his other rebukes, Ellis on Wednesday told prosecutors to stop using the word “oligarch” to describe wealthy Ukrainians, whose dealings with Manafort are at the heart of the fraud charges he faces in the northern Virginia federal court. He said the term is a ""pejorative"" that would risk unfairly prejudicing jurors against Manafort.

More witnesses are scheduled in the case, who appear ready to testify about Manafort's spending habits. Ellis' decisionmaking casts into doubt how much of that testimony will be heard by jurors, or what instructions jurors will get on how to consider this testimony.

DAY ONE TRIAL RECAP: PROSECUTION CALLS FIRST WITNESS, WHO PRAISES MANAFORT'S WORK ETHIC

In a surprising moment, prosecutor Uzo Asonye told Ellis that Rick Gates -- Manafort's former business partner who had been considered a potential star witness for the prosecution -- might not be called to the stand after all.

""Enough is enough. We don’t convict people because they have a lot of money and throw it around."" - U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis

""He may testify, he may not,"" Asonye informed Ellis, saying Mueller's team would make the call depending on the evidence presented.

That disclosure prompted reporters to hustle out of the courtroom to report the news -- ""scurry[ing] out of here like rats out of a sinking ship,"" Ellis said.

“You know who you are going to call,” Ellis sharply told Asonye. “If you are going to call him, then this [debate over a particular exhibit] is a waste of time.”

During opening arguments Tuesday, the defense team made it clear they intend to blame Gates, who handled some day-to-day business operations for Manafort, for many of the alleged reporting deficiencies Manafort is charged with.

Ellis interjected during the prosecutors' opening statement to remind jurors that wealth alone is not criminal, and he rebuked a prosecutor in front of the jury for saying that the ""evidence will show"" Manafort's guilt.

""It isn't a crime to have a lot of money and be profligate in your spending,"" Ellis said.

Jurors also heard Tuesday that Manafort bought an ostrich jacket worth more than $15,000. That prompted Ingrid Newkirk, president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), to issue a statement calling for Manafort to turn over the jacket, which was ""likely made from numerous juvenile ostriches whose throats were slit and whose feathers were plucked out.""

Ellis had harshly admonished members of Mueller's team in a tense preliminary hearing in May, saying they ""don't care"" about Manafort and were pursuing the case against the 69-year-old ex-Trump adviser only as a means of targeting the president.

Ellis has issued tough -- sometimes colorful -- statements and rulings against the defense during the Manafort case, as well.

He interrupted a defense attorney who was outlining to the jury Manafort's efforts to improve American international political outreach, asking, “I take it you plan to offer evidence?” and prompting the attorney to offer some.

Ellis, who took senior status more than a decade ago but continues to hear a limited docket, also seemed to grow impatient on Tuesday after being told that attorneys on both sides were seen rolling their eyes in response to his rulings or after stepping back from the bench.

ELLIS ACCUSES MUELLER TEAM OF TRYING TO USE MANAFORT PROSECUTION TO GET TO TRUMP

The lawyers' facial expressions, Ellis said, appeared to show them thinking, ""Why do we have to put up with this idiot judge?""

Earlier this month, Ellis denied a defense motion to move the trial further from Washington, D.C., rejecting Manafort's argument that media coverage in the major market would risk biasing the jury.

""The mere fact that a case has drawn substantial media attention does not, by itself, warrant a change in venue,"" Ellis wrote in denying the request.

Separately, Ellis also excoriated the defense team earlier this month for opposing Manafort's transfer to an Alexandria, Va., jail -- shortly after complaining that the jail at which he was housed was also inadequate.

""Defense counsel has not identified any general or specific threat to defendant’s safety at the Alexandria Detention Center,"" Ellis wrote. ""They have not done so, because the professionals at the Alexandria Detention Center are very familiar with housing high-profile defendants including foreign and domestic terrorists, spies and traitors.""

He continued, ""It is surprising and confusing when counsel identifies a problem and then opposes the most logical solution to that problem.""

"Press Secretary Sarah Sanders took her long-running feud with CNN’s Jim Acosta to a new level during Thursday’s White House briefing, blasting the media for personal attacks against her and accusing the press of debasing the discourse in America.

The press secretary was responding to similar allegations leveled against President Trump. Specifically, Acosta asked Sanders to say whether the press is indeed the “enemy of the people,” as her boss has controversially claimed, after Ivanka Trump broke with her father on the statement at an Axios event earlier Thursday.

“I think it would be a good thing if you were to say right here, at this briefing, that the press … are not the enemy of the people. I think we deserve that,” Acosta told Sanders.

Sanders pointed out that President Trump has “made his position known,” before the CNN senior White House correspondent interrupted – resulting in Sanders and Acosta talking over each other. From there, Sanders launched into a point-by-point rebuttal.

“It’s ironic, Jim, that not only you and the media attack the president for his rhetoric when they frequently lower the level of conversation in this country. Repeatedly, repeatedly the media resorts to personal attacks without any content other than to incite anger,” Sanders fired back.

She went on to say the media have attacked her personally “on a number of occasions” before specifically calling out rhetoric she said aired on CNN.

“Including your own network said I should be harassed as a life sentence. That I should be choked. ICE officials are not welcomed in their place of worship,” Sanders said.

Sanders then took aim at April’s White House Correspondents Dinner where comedian Michelle Wolf took personal jabs at the press secretary while mocking her job performance, Southern roots and appearance.

“When I was hosted by the Correspondents’ Association, which almost all of you are members of, you brought a comedian up to attack my appearance and call me a traitor to my own gender."" - Sarah Sanders

“When I was hosted by the Correspondents’ Association, which almost all of you are members of, you brought a comedian up to attack my appearance and call me a traitor to my own gender,” Sanders said. “As far as I know, I’m the first press secretary in the history of the United States that’s required Secret Service protection.”

Sanders said the media “continues to ratchet up the verbal assault against the president,” noting that the administration has a “role to play” but the media are also responsible for the discourse in America.

Acosta then reminded Sanders that she did not say whether or not she considers the media the “enemy of the people.”

“Are we to take it, from what you just said, we all get put through the ringer. We all get put in the meat grinder in this town and you’re no exception,” Acosta said. “I’m sorry that that happened to you. I wish that had not happened. But, for the sake of this room. The people that are in this room, this democracy, this country … the president of the United States should not refer to us as the enemy of the people … all I’m asking you to do, Sarah, is to acknowledge that.”

Sanders did not directly respond to Acosta’s question, but complimented his hunger for a response.

“I appreciate your passion. I share it. I’ve addressed this question. I’ve addressed my personal feelings, I’m here to speak on behalf of the president. He’s made his comments clear,” Sanders said.

Acosta didn’t approve of Sanders’ response and took to Twitter to express his feelings.

“I walked out of the end of that briefing because I am totally saddened by what just happened. Sarah Sanders was repeatedly given a chance to say the press is not the enemy and she wouldn't do it. Shameful,” he wrote.",politics
"Two black Christian pastors who were among a group of religious leaders meeting with President Trump at the White House this week are now facing backlash from congregants back home.

The Rev. Phillip Goudeaux of Calvary Christian Center in Sacramento, Calif., and the Rev. John Gray, head of Relentless Church in Greenville, S.C., came under fire from critics who say Trump's policies have harmed the black community.

But at Wednesday's event, dubbed “Meeting with Inner City Pastors,” many of the pastors who attended expressed sympathetic views toward Trump, with one pastor -- the Rev. Darrell Scott, of Cleveland -- calling Trump “the most pro-black president we’ve had in our lifetime.”

Scott also slammed former President Barack Obama for not trying to “prove something to our community” because “he got a pass.”

Goudeaux, a spiritual adviser to the family of Stephon Clark – the unarmed black man who was fatally shot March 18 by two police officers in Sacramento -- praised Trump as well, saying the president restored “hope” to his community, but jokingly urged Trump to not give up on the state of California.

“Please don’t give up on California and Sacramento,” Goudeaux quipped, according to the transcript. “I’m right in the capital there, and we’re working in every area to try to make a difference in people’s lives.

""So, I guess the greatest word I can say for you, Mr. President, is that you have given this country expectations, given us a new hope, a new excitement to believe that things are getting better and are going to get better."" - Pastor Phillip Goudeaux

“So, I guess the greatest word I can say for you, Mr. President, is that you have given this country expectations, given us a new hope, a new excitement to believe that things are getting better and are going to get better,” Goudeaux continued. “And we appreciate that leadership, your tenacity to keep pushing in against all the opposition that comes against you. Thank you so much.”

Gray, meanwhile, was skeptical about attending the meeting with Trump and initially thought he would decline the invitation.

“My wife told me ‘If you go, no one will hear what you say. They won’t understand why you’re there. And any good that could come out of it will get lost in translation,’” Gray wrote on Facebook. “I had not one thing to gain by being there. Not. One.”

Gray said he eventually decided attending the event and even led the prayer so he could speak out about prison reform.

""That could greatly end up benefiting many people who look just like me."" - Pastor John Gray on his decision to attend the meeting

“That could greatly end up benefiting many people who look just like me,” he said. “The pain of so many is too real. The hurt. The isolation. The sense of disenfranchisement. The real hate that has bubbled to the surface of the national discourse.

""I myself have been vocal about my personal disagreements with key policy decisions of this administration,” he added.

But despite their open-minded approach, the two pastors were still facing condemnation from their communities.

Tre Borden, who works in the Sacramento area and attended the Calvary Christian Center when he was young, shared a photo of Goudeaux and called him and other religious leaders “shameless” and “contemptible” for attending the meeting, the Sacramento Bee reported.

“The majority of people in Phillip Goudeaux’s Del Paso congregation are poor and black,” he told the publication. “For him or any other black religious leader to align himself with Trump and his policies in this day and age is extremely distressing and hypocritical. How can he possibly think our current president is helping people who are on the margins of society?”

Gray is reaching out to many people who are criticizing him on social media. His Facebook posts concerning the meeting drew thousands of comments, many of which were critical.

“The pain of those who have been hurt is real. And I would be a dishonorable man not to acknowledge that,” Gray wrote. “But I will honor what I believe was the mandate on my life to be there and available to God should He choose to give me voice,” he added, noting that his comments on social media about why he attended didn’t “invalidate the visceral reaction of those who can’t imagine why I would be in the room.”",politics
"A federal judge on Friday ordered a total restart of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, in a hit to the Trump administration.

The administration last year announced its plan to phase out the program, which provides a level of amnesty to certain illegal immigrants, many of whom came to the U.S. as children.

The order is not set to kick in right away, according to Politico, which notes that the government has until Aug. 23 to file a motion to appeal the ruling by U.S. District Judge John Bates.

However, the judge denied a motion by the government to revise its earlier decision in April -- which determined that the Department of Homeland Security's decision to rescind DACA was ""unlawful,"" according to court documents.

WHAT IS DACA AND WHAT DOES THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANT TO DO WITH IT?

Following that decision, the court issued a 90-day stay acknowledging that the ""DHS could possibly remedy the decision's inadequacies -- at least in theory."" That period of time is now over, the judge said.

""For the reasons explained below, the government's motion will be denied,"" the document read. ""Although the Nielsen Memo purports to offer further explanation for DHS' decision to rescind DACA, it fails to elaborate meaningfully on the agency's primary rationale for its decision: the judgment that the policy was unlawful and unconstitutional.""

The aforementioned memo from DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen provided ""additional 'policy' grounds"" to undo DACA, the judge wrote. However, he added that ""most of these simply repackage legal arguments previously made,"" making them ""'insufficiently independent from the agency's evaluation of DACA's legality' to preclude judicial review or to support the agency's decision.""

In closing the brief, the judge wrote that at no point in this ruling, or the previous one, did the court contend that the DHS didn't have ""the statutory or constitutional authority"" to end the program.

""Rather, the court simply holds that if DHS wishes to rescind the program - or to take any other action, for that matter - it must give a rational explanation for its decision,"" the judge wrote.

""A conclusory assertion that a prior policy is illegal, accompanied by a hodgepodge of illogical or post hoc policy assertions, simply will not do,"" the judge wrote. ""The court therefore reaffirms its conclusion that DACA’s rescission was unlawful and must be set aside.""

ADMINISTRATION ENDS DACA, WITH 6-MONTH DELAY

The DACA program was formed through executive action by former President Barack Obama in 2012 and allowed certain people who came to the U.S. illegally as minors to be protected from immediate deportation. Recipients, widely known as Dreamers, were able to request ""consideration of deferred action"" for a period of two years, which was subject to renewal.

Individuals were able to request DACA status if they were under the age of 31 by June 15, 2012, came to the U.S. before turning 16 and continuously lived in the country since June 15, 2007.

It did not provide ""legal status.""

Running against the Trump-backed candidate is Democrat Danny O’Connor. Earlier Saturday, the president described O'Connor in a tweet as “a puppet” for Pelosi, “weak on Crime, Borders & your 2nd Amendment,” with a goal of raising taxes.

Before welcoming Balderson onstage, Trump described him as “really smart” and “a really hard worker” who would “fight for Ohio.”

Balderson promised to “fight alongside” the president on a variety of issues, and dubbed his opponent “Dishonest Danny O’Connor.”

“Dishonest Danny O’Connor wants to repeal those middle-class tax cuts. Dishonest Danny O’Connor wants to take away your guns. Dishonest Danny supports open borders and sanctuary cities,” Balderson argued. “Dishonest Danny O’Connor will fight against the policies that are turning our country around. And worst of all, Dishonest Danny O’Connor will vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker.”

PRESIDENT TRUMP TO HOLD RALLY IN OHIO AHEAD OF CRUCIAL SPECIAL ELECTION

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, also briefly took the stage during the rally at the request of the president, and was met with chants from the crowd supporting him for the House speakership.

Jordan, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, announced July 26 that he plans to mount an anti-establishment run for speaker, if Republicans keep control of the chamber.

Echoing Balderson’s comments, Trump told the crowd that a vote for O’Connor “is a vote for open borders, which equals massive crime.”

Before describing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as “brave” and “fantastic for this country,” Trump said that abolishing the agency has become a goal for Democrats.

“A vote for Danny boy and the Democrats is a vote to let criminals and drugs pour into our country,” Trump said. “And to let MS-13 run wild in our communities. And you know what they do once they’re there.”

The president went on to promise to “protect our law enforcement"" and cite what he believes is the need for more Republicans in Congress.

“If you want to have a border, if you want to stop the radical Pelosi and Waters -- Maxine Waters -- agenda, there’s only one choice in this election,” Trump said. “That’s vote for Troy Balderson.”

Trump mentioned Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., earlier, asserting that she was “a seriously low IQ person.”

The president’s visit to Ohio was his third rally over the course of a week, following rallies in Florida and Pennsylvania in support of congressional candidates.

"President Trump responded by Twitter on Friday night to a CNN anchor's recent interview with an NBA superstar.

""Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn't easy to do. I like Mike!"" Trump tweeted.

The CNN anchor, Don Lemon, interviewed LeBron James, the former Cleveland Cavaliers star who recently signed a massive contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.

At the end of his message, the president seemed to be expressing his preference for Michael Jordan, the NBA legend who retired in 2003.

During their interview, James and Lemon toured ""I Promise,"" a school for at-risk children that James has established in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. The pair discussed sports, politics and race relations.

Trump seemed to take issue with some of James' comments.

James told Lemon he believes the president is using sports to divide people, while James believes sports has ""always been something that brings someone together.""

When Lemon pressed James if he would consider running for president, he eventually said, ""Let's see first.""

Previously, CNN aired a segment in which the three-time NBA champion was asked whether he’d sit down with Trump, who James once called a “bum” for disinviting Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry from the White House.

“I would never sit across from him,"" James said about Trump.

Trump hasn't always had a negative opinion of James. In a 2013 tweet, Trump wrote, ""Lebron is a great player and a great guy!""

"Bowing to pressure from journalists who complained about it stocking Trump-related merchandise, a museum in Washington, D.C., on Saturday said it would no longer sell T-shirts that say ""You Are Very Fake News.""

The Newseum -- which claims to celebrate the role and history of the press in America -- says it has removed the shirts from its gift shop and online store, and issued a public apology and show of support for members of the media.

“We made a mistake and we apologize,” the organization said in a news release, the Hill reported. “A free press is an essential part of our democracy and journalists are not the enemy of the people.”

The statement marked a reversal from a previous Newseum position, in which the museum said it offered the ""Fake News"" shirts and other items out of respect for conflicting viewpoints.

Newseum spokeswoman Sonya Gavankar had defended the merchandise to Poynter.org, a website for a media think tank, saying the museum encourages an environment of free expression.

“As a nonpartisan organization, people with differing viewpoints feel comfortable visiting the Newseum,"" she said, ""and one of our greatest strengths is that we’re champions not only of a free press but also of free speech.""

But members of the free press weren’t buying it.

The T-shirt debacle followed a heated exchange earlier this week where journalists asked White House press secretary Sarah Sanders to declare that the media is not the “enemy of the people,” a position espoused by President Trump, who has also helped popularize the term “fake news.”

The mission of Newseum, a nonprofit enterprise, is to “increase public understanding of the importance of a free press and the First Amendment,” according to its website.

While the Newseum will no longer sell the “fake news” shirts, it told FOX5 DC that it will continue carrying other Trump-related merchandise, including the top-selling “Make America Great Again” hats.

"Businessman Bill Lee and former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean will face each other in November’s general election as both men are vying to become Tennessee’s next governor.

Lee beat out a crowded and contentious field of GOP candidates to secure his party’s nomination; Dean’s victory was a little more expected.

Current Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican who is term limited, threw his support behind Lee.

“Bill is a man of strong faith and character, and I know he will lead Tennessee’s business-friendly environment, and he is committed to the education and development of the state’s workforce,” Haslam said. “Bill has demonstrated that he will put the needs of Tennesseans at the forefront of any decision he makes as governor of our great state.”

As Dean and Lee turn their attentions away from their primaries and focus on November, here’s a look at the two candidates.

Karl Dean, Democrat

It’s been several years since a Democrat has led Tennessee, but Karl Dean, the former Nashville mayor, is hoping to change that.

Dean easily won the Democratic primary in August, beating out state Rep. Craig Fitzhugh and nurse Mezianne Vale Payne.

Education, jobs and health care round out Dean’s platform for Tennessee. Throughout his campaign, he’s focused on his successes as Nashville’s mayor – a job he held through the Great Recession and the 2010 floods – to point to what a Dean governorship would look like.

“We are going forward. We are going forward in this together,” Dean, 62, told supporters after he won the Democratic primary. “I am proud of the very positive message we kept throughout the primary election. And we're going to keep it positive. That is what I want to do. ... I don't think people want hyper-partisanship.”

FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS HEADQUARTERS

Dean contended Tennessee is “more moderate than people really understand” and said he believes he can beat Republican Bill Lee in November’s general election.

“I think people want somebody who’s going to be practical and pragmatic and get things done,” he told The Tennessean.

When it comes to the state’s education system, Dean hopes to increase teacher pay while expanding after-school programs, according to his campaign website. He said he supports school choice but opposes “for-profit charter schools and vouchers.”

Dean also wants to expand Medicaid and increase access to healthcare in more rural communities where hospitals have shuttered in recent years. The opioid crisis, too, is part of Dean’s platform. He says he supports the state legislature’s task force on the issue and thinks legal prescriptions and overuse of drugs should be a focus, as well as cracking down on dealers and increasing treatment programs.

Bill Lee, Republican

Outsider Bill Lee was one of four leading Republican contenders ahead of the August primary – and the businessman pulled off the upset, sending shockwaves through a state where he was down double-digits in polls as recently as last month.

Lee, 58, beat out Rep. Diane Black, state Rep. Beth Harwell and former state economic development commissioner Randy Boyd. Despite all of the candidates running decidedly pro-Trump campaigns – and Black introducing several bills aligned with the Trump administration’s agenda in the months leading up to the primary – the president never made an endorsement.

For Lee, that didn’t matter. He took advantage of the infighting among the others in the campaign and traveled the state, touting his Christian values along the way.

Calling his primary win “humbling,” Lee’s focus, he said, is on growing Tennessee’s economy and supporting rural communities as well as boosting the state’s education system while cracking down on illegal immigration. He is also a defender of gun rights while staunchly opposed to abortion.

BLACKBURN, BREDESEN LEAD CANDIDATES VYING FOR TENNESSEE SENATE SEAT

“I’m a man who is not a politician, but I do have a vision for Tennessee to lead this nation,” Lee told supporters are securing the GOP primary, adding that he is “proud” of his campaign.

Lee’s first wife died in a horseback riding accident, and although he’s since remarried, he hasn’t shied away from talking about how her death impacted his outlook on life and business.

At the time, his family air conditioning business was successful, but he decided to take a step back from it, appointing a new CEO, to spend time with his children, The Tennessean reported.

“My entire life had turned upside down, and I didn’t much care about anything that I’d previously cared about for a short period of time, and that’s what disarray will do for you,” Lee told the newspaper. “I cared about my family, and that was my primary goal at the time.”

After her death, he started working at a program geared toward at-risk youth and the Men of Valor, an organization that helps men who have been released from prison readapt into society, The Tennessean reported.

According to his campaign website, Lee Company now garners an annual revenue of $215 million, has won numerous awards and employs more than 1,200 people.

Nashville Predators captain Mike Fisher and NASCAR great Darrell Waltrip are “honorary co-chairs” on Lee’s campaign.

"Wyoming state treasurer Mark Gordon won a fiercely contested GOP primary to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Matt Mead on Tuesday, prevailing over a billionaire businessman who received the last-minute endorsement of President Trump.

Foster Friess, the GOP megadonor who Trump tweeted would be ""Strong on Crime, Borders & 2nd Amendment,"" is a major financial contributer to Christian causes, which analysts had predicted might help him secure Wyoming's religious votes in the race against Gordon and several other candidates.



Trump, who has aggressively campaigned nationally for various state candidates ahead of November's midterm elections, won the state by more than 40 points in the 2016 presidential race. His endorsement has carried significant weight in several primary races this year, helping to oust Rep. Mark Sanford in South Carolina in a stunning upset and keeping Rep. Martha Roby's candidacy alive in Alabama.

But it wasn't enough on Tuesday, as vote tallies showed Friess trailing Gordon by more than six percentage points with virtually all precincts reporting.

It was Wyoming's most contested governor's race since 2010, when Mead beat six others in the Republican primary, and was reported to be one of the most expensive ever conducted in state history. Friess put more than $2 million of his own money into the campaign.

Gordon, having served two terms, was the only Republican running with significant experience in government or elected office. The 61-year-old ranches near Buffalo, Wyoming, and served on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

He will face state Rep. Mary Throne, who won the Democratic primary Tuesday, in the general election. Wyoming is among the reddest states, and Gordon is favored to win the general election and become governor.

Gordon is finishing his first full term as treasurer, a job to which he was appointed in 2012.



Meanwhile, Sen. John Barrasso, a vocal supporter of President Trump, fended off a well-funded challenger in Wyoming's Republican primary Tuesday, soundly defeating Jackson Hole business investor Dave Dodson by more than thirty percentage points.

Dodson, who had tapped at least $1 million of his own funds in the race, had advocated for term limits and more action to bring down health care costs.



WATCH: BARRASSO DEFENDS TRUMP, SAYS HE WAS TOUGH ON PUTIN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

Barrasso for years has been one of the most outspoken advocates of repealing President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, an effort that fell just short of passing in the Senate last year.

Barrasso has served in the Senate since June 2007, when he was appointed following the death of Craig Thomas. Barrasso then won a special election in 2008 to complete Thomas' term.

Dodson sharply criticized Barrasso for taking corporate PAC money, though much of his own individual contributions — and Barrasso's — come from out of state.

There were three lesser-known candidates trying to win the Republican Senate race and in an unusual move, one of them bailed from the race Monday afternoon.

Wilson businessman Gary Trauner ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.

Elsewhere in Wyoming, incumbent Liz Cheney won the Republican nomination for the state's lone seat in the U.S. House. Cheney beat two other Republicans in Tuesday's primary: Blake Stanley of Cheyenne and Rod Miller of Buford.

Stanley and Miller both characterized themselves as blue-collar conservatives and ran low-key campaigns.

Cheney is the elder daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.

"Judge Brett Kavanaugh views Roe v. Wade as ""settled law,"" U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Tuesday after meeting with President Trump's Supreme Court pick. But abortion rights activists and Democrats remained unconvinced that Kavanaugh won't try to restrict abortion access from the bench.

In a two-hour meeting, Collins said Kavanaugh told her he agrees with Chief Justice John Roberts, who called the 1973 Roe v. Wade case that legalized abortion ""settled law"" during his confirmation hearings in 2005.

""We talked at great length about precedent and the application of stare decisis to abortion cases,"" Collins said, using the legal term for settled precedent.

Kavanaugh's views on abortion are of major importance to Collins, who has vowed to oppose Kavanaugh's nomination if shows ""demonstrated hostility"" toward Roe v. Wade.

Collins described their discussion as ""productive"" and ""informative,"" but said she would not decide how to vote until after the Senate Judiciary Committee holds confirmation hearings on Kavanaugh next month.

Meanwhile, Ilsye Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement that Collins should not be reassured by Kavanaugh about abortion issues, CentralMaine.com reported.

“With all due respect to Senator Collins, ‘settled law’ means nothing. It is a bunch of code words, long used by many conservative judges, meant to hide their real beliefs and anti-choice record."" - Ilsye Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America

“With all due respect to Senator Collins, ‘settled law’ means nothing,"" Hogue said. ""It is a bunch of code words, long used by many conservative judges, meant to hide their real beliefs and anti-choice record.""

Hogue added that the current Supreme Court, led by Roberts, ""has spent much of the last term re-litigating so-called ‘settled law.’""

""Most troubling of all is Senator Collins’ reference to Roberts today,"" she said. ""Roberts has voted in lockstep with anti-abortion forces on every vote since joining the court.”

Democrats fighting Kavanaugh's ascension to the high court sought to keep up the pressure, dismissing Kavanaugh's stance on Roe v. Wade as an artful dodge.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., met with Kavanaugh later Tuesday. He said the judge refused to answer when asked directly whether Roe. V. Wade was correctly decided.

That lack of clarity, Schumer said, should ""send shivers down the spine of any American who believes in reproductive freedom for women.""

Schumer added that Kavanaugh has a special obligation to be forthcoming on abortion, given Trump's ""litmus test that he would only appoint judges who would overturn Roe.""

Kavanaugh has already met with most Senate Republicans, but winning support from Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, could be crucial. Both senators support access to abortion services.

Collins has never opposed a Supreme Court nominee, CentralMaine.com reported.

Kavanaugh has already met with most Senate Republicans, but winning support from Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, could be crucial. Both senators support access to abortion services.

Republicans have a narrow 50-49 majority in the Senate due to the absence of ailing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and can't afford a single defection on Kavanaugh if every Democrat votes no.

Kavanagh, 53, is a conservative who, in replacing retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, could tip the court rightward for a generation.

Several Democratic female senators joined with advocates for women's health care Tuesday to talk about the stakes of adding Kavanaugh to the court, particularly when it comes to access to abortion services.

""This is a wakeup call,"" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. ""Do not take this moment lightly.""

But Republicans still hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by the start of the court's session on Oct. 1.

"Lanny Davis, the attorney for President Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen, said Tuesday that his client is “more than happy” to tell Special Counsel Robert Mueller “all that he knows.”

Cohen pleaded guilty Tuesday to campaign-finance violations and other charges. He said Trump directed him to arrange the payments of hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal to fend off damage to his 2016 White House bid.

In entering the plea, Cohen did not specifically name the two women or even Trump, recounting instead that he worked with an “unnamed candidate.” But the amounts and the dates all lined up with the payments made to Daniels and McDougal.

Harmeet Dhillon, an attorney and Republican National committeewoman in California, said Davis appeared to sell his client out because she believes it is a ""real stretch"" to say that someone who is paying off hush money to a blackmailer is trying to affect the outcome of an election.

Cohen could have received up to 65 years in prison if convicted of all charges. However, as part of his plea deal, Cohen agreed not to challenge any sentence between 46 and 63 months. The deal does not involve a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors.

Cohen’s plea follows months of scrutiny from federal investigations and a falling-out with the president, for whom Cohen once said he would “take a bullet.”

Davis told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Tuesday that Cohen has knowledge that would be “of interest” to the Mueller investigation. He mentioned the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016. The meeting is key to Mueller’s probe into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign figures, including Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, attended the meeting.

The Trump team maintains that the meeting failed to yield compromising information on Clinton, Trump’s Democratic opponent.

“The obvious possibility [exists] of a conspiracy to collude and corrupt the American democracy system in the 2016 election, which the Trump Tower meeting was all about,” Davis said. “But also [there's the possibility of] knowledge about the computer crime of hacking and whether or not Mr. Trump knew ahead of time about that crime and cheered it on.”

Twelve Russian military intelligence officers hacked into the Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic Party and released tens of thousands of private communications in a sweeping conspiracy by the Kremlin to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election.

The 29-page indictment lays out how, months before Americans went to the polls, Russians schemed to break into key Democratic email accounts, including those belonging to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Stolen emails, many politically damaging for Clinton, appeared on WikiLeaks in the campaign’s final stretch.

Davis had said that the Cohen’s plea showed Trump committed a crime.

Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, noted in a statement that “there is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president in the government’s charges against Mr. Cohen.”

Daniel Petalas, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department’s public integrity section, said, “This brings President Trump closer into the criminal conduct.”

“The president has certain protections while a sitting president, but if it were true, and he was aware and tried to influence an election, that could be a federal felony offense,” Petalas said. “This strikes close to home.”

"Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team was one holdout juror away from winning a conviction against Paul Manafort on all 18 counts of bank and tax fraud, juror Paula Duncan told Fox News in an exclusive interview Wednesday.

“It was one person who kept the verdict from being guilty on all 18 counts,” Duncan, 52, said. She added that Mueller’s team of prosecutors often seemed bored, apparently catnapping during parts of the trial.

The identities of the jurors have been closely held, kept under seal by Judge T.S. Ellis III at Tuesday's conclusion of the high-profile trial.

But Duncan gave a behind-the-scenes account to Fox News on Wednesday, after the jury returned a guilty verdict against the former Trump campaign chairman on eight financial crime counts and deadlocked on 10 others.

Duncan described herself as an avid supporter of President Trump, but said she was moved by four full boxes of exhibits provided by Mueller’s team – though she was skeptical about prosecutors' motives in the financial crimes case.

“Certainly Mr. Manafort got caught breaking the law, but he wouldn’t have gotten caught if they weren’t after President Trump,” Duncan said of the special counsel’s case, which she separately described as a “witch hunt to try to find Russian collusion,” borrowing a phrase Trump has used in tweets more than 100 times.

“Something that went through my mind is, this should have been a tax audit,” Duncan said, sympathizing with the foundation of the Manafort defense team’s argument.

She described a tense and emotional four days of deliberations, which ultimately left one juror holding out. Behind closed doors, tempers flared at times, even though jurors never explicitly discussed Manafort’s close ties to Trump.

“It was a very emotionally charged jury room – there were some tears,” Duncan said about deliberations with a group of Virginians she didn’t feel included many “fellow Republicans.”

A political allegiance to the president also raised conflicted feelings in Duncan, but she said it ultimately didn’t change her decision about the former Trump campaign chairman.

“Finding Mr. Manafort guilty was hard for me. I wanted him to be innocent, I really wanted him to be innocent, but he wasn’t,” Duncan said. “That’s the part of a juror, you have to have due diligence and deliberate and look at the evidence and come up with an informed and intelligent decision, which I did.”

Duncan, a Missouri native and mother of two, showed Fox News her two notebooks with her juror number #0302 on the covers.

In the interview, Duncan also described how the special counsel’s prosecutors apparently had a hard time keeping their eyes open.

“A lot of times they looked bored, and other times they catnapped – at least two of them did,” Duncan said. “They seemed very relaxed, feet up on the table bars and they showed a little bit of almost disinterest to me, at times.”

The jury box was situated in a corner of the courtroom that gave them an unobstructed head-on view of the prosecutors and defense, while members of the media and the public viewed both parties from behind.

COULD MANAFORT COOPERATE WITH MUELLER'S TEAM? A LOOK AT HIS OPTIONS AFTER THE GUILTY VERDICT

Judge Ellis told jurors, including Duncan, that their names would remain sealed after the trial’s conclusion, because of dangerous threats he received during the proceedings.

But the verdict gave Duncan a license to share her story without fear.

“Had the verdict gone any other way, I might have been,” Duncan said.

MANAFORT CONVICTED ON BANK AND TAX FRAUD CHARGES

Her account of the deliberations is no longer a secret. And neither is the pro-Trump apparel she kept for a long drive to the federal courthouse in Alexandria every day.

“Every day when I drove, I had my Make America Great Again hat in the backseat,” said Duncan, who said she plans to vote for Trump again in 2020. “Just as a reminder.”

"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired back at President Trump on Wednesday, saying the president should focus on other matters instead of badmouthing his city.

The mayor was quick to allude to Trump's mounting legal troubles one day after the president assailed Chicago's crime rate and immigration policies at a Tuesday night rally in West Virginia.

“First of all, we'll always be a welcoming city, because Chicago welcomed my grandfather, etc. But let me just say one thing, if I were Donald Trump, I’d spend my time figuring out which attorney I’m going to have,” Emanuel told Fox 32 Chicago.

One night earlier, Trump took jabs at Chicago's status as a high-crime city that also served as a sanctuary for immigrants.

""Take a look at Chicago. How about the mayor of Chicago? It's like a war zone. This is what those policies do,"" Trump said at the rally.

Chicago is known to have the some of the nation's most violent neighborhoods, with nearly 60 people shot and four people killed last weekend alone, Fox News reported.

But a researcher told Fox 32 that violence in the city's ""war zones"" is ""virtually all carried out by native-born Americans"" rather than immigrants.

Emanuel, meanwhile, was apparently preaching to the Democratic choir: A new survey showed that 70 percent of Cook County residents have an unfavorable view of Trump, the station reported.

Trump and Emanuel have a history of trading barbs.

In July, after Trump's Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Emanuel called for Trump's security clearance to be taken away, the Chicago Tribune reported.

“I don’t know if I’ve ever thought this, but I did yesterday: Can you actually take away a president’s security clearance, since they shouldn’t be getting intel from the intel community?” Emanuel said, criticizing Trump's performance at the summit. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Amid Chicago's crime problems, Emanuel faces building pressure to take action or resign, the report said.

He also reportedly came under fire for comments that linked the city's violence to the moral character of people in some ethnic neighborhoods.",politics
"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made clear Wednesday that, unlike President Trump, she doesn't dig coal.

“We're not gonna have a coal power plant floating around,” Pelosi said during a discussion about energy policy at the Public Policy Institute of California in San Francisco.

Her appearance coincided with the Trump administration’s rollback and replacement of Obama-era regulations on emissions from coal-fired power plants.

The newly unveiled Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, as it’s called, would give authority to the states to set their own rules how to restrict carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.

“And it really is a moral issue if you believe as I do that this is God’s creation [and] we have to be good stewards of it,” Pelosi said.

“We have evangelicals and others with us — er, some, those who believe in God’s creation. So, in any case this was a big thing for us. I had to fight some Democrats. Senator Byrd had a coal powered plan fueling the Capitol, you know I [unintelligible] that’s gonna go, with all due respect to West Virginia we’re not gonna have a coal power plant floating around.”

But as Pelosi mocked West Virginia, many in the state celebrated the administration’s efforts to revitalize the industry.

“[Trump’s] almost single-handedly turned this industry around,” Chris Hamilton, senior vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association, said on ""Fox & Friends"" on Wednesday, noting the “the darkest days” for the industry are now over.

“We experienced perhaps the darkest days within the coal industry during the — President Obama’s eight years and as a result, we just saw nothing but the, you know, the type of consequences you find when you have a president utilizing every resource available to him to ratchet down and … do away with the coal industry, “ he added.

Bo Copley, a West Virginia coal worker who made headlines in 2016 when he confronted then-candidate Hillary Clinton with his family photo and asked about her plans to cut coal mining jobs, also praised Trump’s plans to ease the regulations and follow through his campaign promise to protect the industry and the jobs.

“It's great for us to be able to say we have someone who cares about the people in this state and cares about the people in our industry, that he's got our back,” he told Fox News on Monday, adding that the administration’s support for the industry is one of the reasons the state will continue to back him.",politics
"So how much does all this sound and fury affect the midterms?

Ordinarily, the conviction of a president's former campaign chairman and guilty pleas by his ex-national security adviser and former personal lawyer—who accused said president of directing one of his crimes—would detonate like a neutron bomb.

But as with all matters involving President Trump, the normal rules may not apply and what happens in November is anything but clear.

It's not hard to imagine a blue wave developing that would carry Democrats to control of the House. It's also not that hard to imagine that Trump’s Teflon, which has remained undented by so many past crises, enables the GOP to hang on to control. The president's grip on his base seems as strong as ever, although ambivalent Republicans could always opt to stay home.

The Michael Cohen plea, and his testimony that Trump directed him to arrange hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, has dramatically changed the political conversation.

The same goes for the Wall Street Journal revealing that Trump pal David Pecker, the CEO of American Media who runs the National Enquirer, has spoken with prosecutors under a grant of immunity. That could unravel what happened when Trump and Cohen were trying to buy the rights to McDougal’s story, which the tabloid had bought and buried for $150,000 toward the end of the 2016 campaign.

Before Tuesday, the White House and its allies had good success in keeping the focus on the lack of evidence of Russian collusion emerging in Robert Mueller’s probe. But that is changing.

Trump, for his part, told Fox's Ainsley Earhardt that he only learned of the payments ""later on,"" which contradicts not just Cohen's version but one of his tapes. The president also said this:

""Almost everybody that runs for office has campaign violations. But what Michael Cohen pled to weren't even campaign related. They weren't crimes ...

""You know, campaign violations are considered not a big deal, frankly. But if somebody defrauded a bank and he's going to get 10 years in jail or 20 years in jail but if you can say something bad about Donald Trump and you'll go down to two years or three years, which is the deal he made. In all fairness to him, most people are going to do that.""

While pundits and legal scholars debate that view, how much does all the swampiness break through to actual voters?

Both parties are struggling with ways to deal with the shadow cast by the Trump-related investigations, especially for their most vulnerable members.

The New York Times reports: ""Senior Republican Party leaders began urging their most imperiled incumbents on Wednesday to speak out about the wrongdoing surrounding President Trump, with Representative Tom Cole, a former House Republican campaign chairman, warning, 'Where there’s smoke, and there's a lot of smoke, there may well be fire.'""

The Washington Post: ""A day after President Trump's former lawyer implicated him in directing a crime, Democratic leaders sharpened their election-year attack on the GOP as the party of corruption. But in an effort to keep the electoral focus on bread-and-butter issues, they largely steered clear of any discussion of impeachment.

""Party leaders encouraged candidates and elected members to talk instead about demanding protection for the ongoing Justice Department investigations of Trump and his allies, offering a clear sign that they feel confident that grass-roots energy against Trump will show up at the polls without the need for a divisive rallying cry from the stump.""

Politico goes with this headline: ""'A New Cherry on Top': Trump Scandal Fallout Hangs Over Midterms.""

But the actual story is anticlimactic:

""However momentous, even the conviction of Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, a guilty plea involving hush money by his personal lawyer and the indictment of a key congressional ally wasn’t enough to dramatically alter the trajectory of the midterm elections.""

The truth is that no one really knows how this is going to play out.

The situation is somewhat reminiscent of 1998, when some Democrats distanced themselves from Bill Clinton as he was in the process of being impeached, but the party won five seats in the House because Newt Gingrich’s GOP was seen as overreaching.

The situation is very different because Clinton had sex with a former intern in the White House, while Trump’s alleged encounters took place more than a decade ago, although the hush money was paid during the last campaign.

The situation is also very different because Trump has an almost iron grip on most of his party, who view the investigations and media coverage of the president as unfair.

The question this fall will ultimately be whether a majority of voters want to put a check on the Trump presidency or, despite the controversies and prosecutions, leave him in full control of Washington.",politics

In an extraordinary new clash between the president and the nation’s top law enforcement official, whom Trump appointed and who was one of the president’s earliest and most enthusiastic 2016 supporters, Sessions had issued the warning a day earlier after Trump alleged in a “Fox & Friends” interview that his AG never “took control” of the DOJ.

“I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in,” Sessions fired back.

In a set of Friday morning tweets, Trump cited that statement as a jumping off point for what he wants Sessions to pursue next:

“Jeff, this is GREAT, what everyone wants, so look into all of the corruption on the 'other side' including deleted Emails, Comey lies & leaks, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr … FISA abuse, Christopher Steele & his phony and corrupt Dossier, the Clinton Foundation, illegal surveillance of Trump Campaign, Russian collusion by Dems - and so much more. Open up the papers & documents without redaction? Come on Jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting!”

The list referred to a batch of controversies Trump and his allies have long cited as a partisan counterweight to allegations of Russia collusion and obstruction of justice, at the heart of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe. Trump was citing a slew of fired and former FBI officials – ex-director James Comey, anti-Trump agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, ex-deputy Andrew McCabe – and sitting DOJ official Bruce Ohr whose wife worked for the company behind the salacious anti-Trump dossier. The tweets also referred to the surveillance efforts against his campaign associates and Hillary Clinton’s email and foundation controversies.

Democrats have long accused Republicans of trying to distract from the Mueller probe by focusing on such matters, but Trump and his allies argue there’s never been a full accounting for how political actions may have factored into the start of the Russia probe.

Meanwhile, the Trump-Sessions feud has instantly renewed speculation over how long Sessions can hold on in his current position.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Thursday that despite Sessions’ accomplishments, he believes it “very likely” Trump will appoint a new attorney general, perhaps after the midterms.

Trump upped the pressure on Sessions even more Friday when he cited the jail sentence given Thursday to leaker Reality Winner.

“Ex-NSA contractor to spend 63 months in jail over ‘classified’ information. Gee, this is ‘small potatoes’ compared to what Hillary Clinton did! So unfair Jeff, Double Standard,” he tweeted.

The tweets followed Sessions statement Thursday in which he staunchly defended his actions in office:

“I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President’s agenda—one that protects the safety and security rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty.”

He went on to say, “While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.”

The president for months has railed against Sessions over his recusal from the Russia probe. Sessions recused himself in 2017, due to his involvement with the Trump campaign, per Justice Department regulations.

Rod Rosenstein, his deputy, was then named to oversee the investigation. He appointed Mueller as special counsel.

"A driver in Canada apparently was fired after a video of them swerving a company truck to seemingly splash pedestrians with puddle water was posted online.

The dashcam footage, posted Friday, shows a large Ford vehicle with a ladder and other items atop swerving all over the lane in Ottawa, driving toward puddles and splashing those walking past.

The company's name, Black & McDonald Limited, is seen displayed on the truck as the driver moves past the car filming the scene.

Black & McDonald Limited, a ""multi-trade prime contractor,"" took to Facebook to apologize for the driver's actions, which they labeled as ""unacceptable driving.""

""We want to reassure the public that safety is our #1 priority,"" the company wrote. ""This is an isolated incident and the individual is no longer employed with Black & McDonald.""

Sgt. Mark Gatien, of the Ottawa Police Service, tweeted that authorities saw the video. He thanked the company for ""their quick and decisive action,"" and also thanked a patrol officer ""who assisted in this outcome.""",world
"The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a weekend attack on Western tourists in the Central Asian nation of Tajikistan that left four people dead, including two U.S. cyclists.

The group said in a statement late Monday that several of its soldiers attacked the “citizens of the Crusader coalition,” referring to an incident on Sunday when a car rammed into a group of foreign cyclists south of the Tajik capital Dushanbe. After the crash, the driver and the passengers got out of the vehicle and attacked the tourists with knives, leaving four dead and three injured.

Among the dead were two people from the United States, one from Switzerland and one from the Netherlands. Three others suffered minor injuries. The victims were not immediately identified. Tajikistan’s Interior Ministry said three of the victims died at the scene and one died while being transported to the hospital.

2 US CYCLISTS AMONG 4 KILLED IN HIT-AND-RUN IN TAJIKISTAN, 3 OTHERS KILLED

ISIS often refers to the U.S.-led coalition they are fighting in Syria and Iraq as ""crusaders."" Authorities in the Tajikistan called the incident an “attack” and said terrorism was a possible motive.

There were conflicting reports on how many suspects related to the attack have been killed as police tried to detain them, and how many have been arrested. The BBC reported citing Tajikistan’s Interior Ministry that four suspects were killed and another four were arrested.

The statement from the jihadi group did not say how many militants took part in the attack. There was no immediate reaction to the ISIS claim from Dushanbe on Tuesday.

However, the Russian state news agency Interfax cited a statement from Tajikistan’s Interior Ministry blaming the attack on the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan, a local party that was banned several years ago for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government.

TERROR STUDIED AS POSSIBLE MOTIVE IN TAJIKISTAN CRASH KILLING 4, INCLUDING 2 AMERICANS

The BBC reported ISIS was not known to have a large presence in Tajikistan but members of the group were from the Central Asian nation.

The incident took place about 93 miles south of Dushanbe, the capital of the former Soviet country surrounded by Afghanistan, China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.

The Latest on developments in Afghanistan (all times local):

6:30 p.m.

An Afghan official says the last of three attackers who targeted a repatriation center in the eastern city of Jalalabad has been killed, ending an assault that left a security guard and five civilians dead.

Attahullah Khogyani, the spokesman for the provincial governor, said another 14 people were wounded in Tuesday's attack.

He says a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle full of explosives outside the compound, allowing two other attackers to get inside.

No one immediately claimed the attack, but the Taliban and the Islamic State group carry out near-daily attacks in the Nangarhar province, of which Jalalabad is the capital.

3:55 p.m.

Afghan officials say casualty reports so far indicate four people were killed and eight were wounded in the militant attack underway in the eastern city of Jalalabad.

Gen. Ghulam Sanayee Stanikzai, the provincial police chief in Nangarhar, says the fighting between militants and Afghan security forces also left two policemen wounded.

Stanikzai says the militants on Tuesday targeted the government building of the refugee and repatriation department in Jalalabad, the provincial capital. Stanikzai and Gov. Hayatullah Hayat say Afghan forces killed two militants during the battle.

Attahullah Khogyani, Hayat's spokesman, says Afghan forces reacted quickly when the attack started and rescued all participants of a meeting of non-governmental organizations that was taking place in the building as well as the head of the refugee department.

12:10 p.m.

An Afghan provincial official says a coordinated militant attack is underway in the city of Jalalabad, the capital of eastern Nangarhar province.

Zabihullah Zemarai, a member of the provincial council, says there was first a car bombing — likely an explosion set off by a suicide car bomber — near the city's provincial hospital and health department on Tuesday, followed by gunfire.

He says a refugee and repatriation department is also located in the same area of the city so the immediate target wasn't clear.

Zemarai couldn't confirm any casualties but says a heavy gunbattle is taking place between Afghan security forces and the attackers.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but both the Taliban and the Islamic State group are active in Nangarhar.

10:50 a.m.

An Afghan official says a roadside bombing has killed at least 11 people on a bus, including women and children, in the country's western Farah province.

Abdul Jabar Shahiq, chief of the province's health department, says the bombing on Tuesday morning in the Bala Buluk district also wounded 31 people, all civilians.

Shahiq says the bus was on its way from Herat province toward the capital, Kabul, when it struck the roadside bomb.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing but the Taliban have a strong presence in the province, especially in Bala Buluk where they often plant roadside bombs to target government officials or Afghan security forces.

The highest-ranking American at the Vatican insisted Tuesday he never knew or even suspected that his former boss reportedly sexually abused boys and adult seminarians, telling The Associated Press he is livid that he was kept in the dark because he would have done something about it.

Cardinal Kevin Farrell, head of the Vatican's family and laity office, spoke as the U.S. church hierarchy has come under fire from ordinary American Catholics outraged that ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick's misconduct with men was apparently an open secret in some U.S. church circles.

An open letter Tuesday in the conservative Catholic magazine First Things urged Catholics to withhold diocesan donations to the U.S. church until an independent investigation determines which U.S. bishops knew about McCarrick's misdeeds — a ""nuclear option"" aimed at making the laity's sense of betrayal heard and felt.

Some of that outrage has been directed at Farrell, who was consecrated as a bishop by McCarrick in 2001 and served as his vicar general in the archdiocese of Washington until McCarrick's 2006 retirement. Some Catholic commentators have speculated that Farrell must have at least heard the same rumors that some Catholic laity, students and professors at Catholic University in Washington and even some journalists had heard.

Farrell lived in the same building as McCarrick and other priests and bishops, a converted school building off Dupont Circle, the top floor of which serves as a residence for Washington clergy. But Farrell said he never heard any rumors about his boss' penchant for young men, or suspected anything.

""That might be hard for somebody to believe, but if that's the only thing on your mind, well then you'll focus on that. I was focused on running the archdiocese. What Cardinal McCarrick was doing here, there and everywhere and all over the world, didn't enter into my daily routine of running the archdiocese of Washington,"" he said.

""At no time did anyone ever approach me and tell me. And I was approached by over 70 victims of abuse (in different cases) from all over the United States after 2002,"" when the U.S. sex abuse scandal first erupted, Farrell told the AP his office's reception room.

""Never once did I even suspect,"" he said. ""Now, people can say 'Well you must be a right fool that you didn't notice.' I must be a right fool, but I don't think I am. And that's why I feel angry.""

Pope Francis on Saturday accepted McCarrick's resignation as a cardinal and ordered him to live a lifetime of penance and prayer pending the outcome of a canonical trial for the sex abuse.

McCarrick, 88, was initially removed from public ministry in June after U.S. church officials determined that an accusation that he fondled a teenage altar server in New York in the 1970s was ""credible and substantiated.""

Since then, another man identified only as James has come forward saying that McCarrick first exposed himself to him when he was 11 and then engaged in a sexually abusive relationship with him for the next 20 years. McCarrick has denied the initial accusation but hasn't responded to James' accusations.

At the time of the June 20 announcement about McCarrick, the New Jersey archdioceses of Newark and Metuchen revealed that they had received three complaints from adults alleging misconduct and harassment by McCarrick and had settled two of them.

It was apparently no secret that McCarrick sometimes invited seminarians to his New Jersey beach house and into his bed, suggesting that some in the U.S. hierarchy knew of his misconduct but turned a blind eye. Certainly the New Jersey bishops who handled the settlements in 2005 and 2007 knew.

In addition, a group of concerned American Catholics reportedly travelled to the Vatican in 2000 to warn Vatican officials of McCarrick's harassment and misconduct, but he was still appointed Washington archbishop and made a cardinal in 2001.

Farrell said he never knew anything about a beach house and seminarians, and that no one ever presented any accusation to the Washington archdiocese, which from 2002 onwards was deluged with claims from victims of sexually abusive priests.

""If there were a complaint, it would have come and I would have discussed it with the (archdiocesan) chancellor, who was a woman at the time, a woman who was in charge of victims and in charge of all the telephone calls we would get,"" he said.

The current archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, has said that a review of archdiocesan records showed no complaints about McCarrick.

""There is no record there,"" Farrell told the AP. ""Because I would know about it.""",world

Decades after the end of the Korean War in 1953, the remains of dozens of presumed U.S. war dead began their journey home following a repatriation ceremony in South Korea on Wednesday.

North Korea handed over the remains in 55 boxes last week and allowed a U.S. military transport plane to move them to the U.S. Osan Air Base near Seoul in South Korea. While it was an apparent goodwill gesture by North Korea toward the United States, the return comes amid growing skepticism about whether the North will follow through on its pledge of nuclear disarmament.

Hundreds of U.S. and South Korean troops gathered at a hanger at the Osan base for the repatriation ceremony, which included a rifle salute and the playing of the U.S. and South Korean national anthems and dirges in front of the U.N. flag-covered metal cases containing the remains.

After the ceremony, the remains were moved one by one to transport planes which will fly them to Hawaii, where they will undergo an in-depth forensic analysis, in some cases using mitochondrial DNA profiles, at a Defense Department laboratory to establish identifications. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week that the return of the 55 boxes was a positive step but not a guarantee that the bones are American.

Vice President Mike Pence, the son of a Korean War veteran, is to fly to Hawaii for what the military calls an ""honorable carry ceremony"" marking the arrival of remains to American soil.

The repatriation is a breakthrough in a long-stalled U.S. effort to obtain war remains from North Korea. About 7,700 U.S. soldiers are listed as missing from the 1950-53 Korean War, and 5,300 of the remains are believed to still be in North Korea.

""The remains received from North Korea are being handled with the utmost care and respect by professional historians, forensic scientists, uniformed personnel and government officials,"" the U.S.-led U.N. Command said in a statement. It said it ""never leaves troops behind, living or deceased, and will continue the mission of repatriation until every service member returns home.""",world

Russian journalists who were killed in the Central African Republic had been working on an investigation into Russian private military contractors working abroad, their colleagues said Wednesday.

The reporters were killed in an ambush earlier in the week outside the town of Sibut in the CAR, according to local and Russian officials. CAR officials have only said that the reporters were found dead after being kidnapped by about 10 men wearing turbans and speaking only Arabic, but have yet to give further details.

Exiled Russian opposition figure Mikhail Khodorkovsky said on Facebook Wednesday that the journalists were collaborating with his investigative project on a story entitled ""Russian mercenaries.""

Andrei Konyakhin, the chief editor of Khodorkovsky's Investigations Management Center, said the reporters were trying to shed light on a private Russian security company operating in CAR, and on Russia's interests there. Russian and foreign media have mentioned the firm's name in reports as Wagner, a military contractor group that is linked to a businessman associated with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Konyakhin said the men, Kirill Radchenko, Alexander Rastorguyev and Orkhan Dzhemal, were traveling to the north of the country to talk to a United Nations representative there. The journalists were carrying several thousand US dollars in cash to fund their stay in CAR, as well as valuable cameras and gear.

Konyakhin told the Associated Press in a phone interview that the main working scenario at the moment was that the killings were the result of a robbery, but he is skeptical and thinks the attack could be linked to their investigation.

""This was done in a very demonstrative fashion,"" he said, wondering why the attackers didn't bother to cover up their tracks, hide the car and why they left the driver alive. ""If they could have just taken everything from them, why kill them?""

Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon and once Russia's richest man, lives in London after spending 10 years in a Russian prison in a case widely seen as politicly motivated. From exile, Khodorkovsky supports a number of civil society groups and media projects in Russia, where authorities continue to investigate him on a variety of charges.",world

The stray pup, believed to be from a nearby community, jumped in on the action of the 13-mile race after mingling with runners — a feat marathon coordinator Allison Hunter said she'd never seen before.

Stormy, despite not ""taking it as seriously as the other runners,"" according to race organizer Grant Wholey, reportedly completed the run in two-and-a-half hours, which was the average time it took his human competitors to finish the event.

After the race, the pooch was taken to the pound, where rules indicate strays must stay for a week before being put up for adoption.

Although locked up in the shelter, Stormy was given a medal for his efforts ""since he had done the whole thing,"" Wholey said.

Wholey and Hunter ""gave [Stormy] a medal and gave him more exposure so hopefully the owner might see,"" ABC News reported.

"Cameras that may not work, 11-year-old cars and hundreds of rolls of toilet paper -- just some of the items you can bid on during the U.S. Embassy in London's moving sale.

The 100 packs of 12 rolls each of mini jumbo toilet paper are being offered in ""new and unused"" condition in the online auction, which also includes a used Volvo and two cameras -- which may be broken.

None of the items have any official US insignias or historical value and appear to be part of the embassy’s “spring cleaning” after its relocation earlier this year to a new $1 billion facility in Vauxhall.

An embassy spokesperson told The Independent the auction was an annual event that allows State Department employees to get money back for items that are “no longer needed, or have been damaged, or refreshed.”

The sale of the toilet paper, the spokesperson said, was because the dispensers at the new embassy are different dimensions and the old rolls don’t fit.

The spokesperson described them as “probably a bit above bog standard.”

They are being sold as a set, with 30 bids already made on them.

Probably the most expensive item on the auction list is a nearly 11-year-old black Volvo S80, which was described as in “usable” condition. So far there have been 34 bids for the car.

Other items include five Dyson vacuum cleaners, 22 plastic stacking chairs with wheels, a ceramic lamp without a shade, a Bosch circular saw and a barcode scanner set.

The two cameras – an old Sony Mavica and a Nikon 105VR – are being offered “sold as seen” with “working condition unknown.”

The auction runs until August 8.

It appears the embassy in London is not the only one with an online auction. The embassies in Ankara, Turkey; Yerevan, Armenia; Adana, Turkey; and Kyiv, Ukraine are holding their own sales while locations in Stockholm, Sweden; Lisbon, Portugal; and Belgrade, Serbia are preparing other auctions.

Zimbabwe's ruling party has won a majority of seats in Parliament, the electoral commission announced Wednesday, as the country braced for the first official results of the presidential election.

The ruling ZANU-PF won 109 seats while the main opposition MDC party had 41 in the country's 210-seat House of Assembly. The commission said 58 seats had yet to be declared.

The commission says it will announce the results of Zimbabwe's presidential race, pitting President Emmerson Mnangagwa against opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, only after all the votes have come in from across the country.

Western and other election observers were poised Wednesday morning to give their first public assessments of the election and whether it was free and fair.

The opposition alleges the elections have irregularities, saying voting results were not posted outside one-fifth of polling stations as required by law.

Mnangagwa's government, meanwhile, accused Chamisa and his supporters of inciting ""violence"" by already declaring he had won Monday's election, the first after former leader Robert Mugabe stepped down in November under military pressure.

""Let me also warn such individuals and groups that no one is above the law,"" Home Affairs Minister Obert Mpofu said. Security forces ""will remain on high alert and continue to monitor the security situation in the country.""

Zimbabweans desperately hope Monday's peaceful vote will lift them out of economic and political stagnation after decades of Mugabe's rule, but the country is haunted by a history of electoral violence and manipulation that means trust is scarce, despite today's freer environment.

While the electoral commission has five days from the end of voting to release the final tally, the national mood is growing anxious partly because unofficial results are already swirling on social media.

Dozens of opposition supporters gathered Tuesday evening at their headquarters in the capital, Harare, celebrating in the belief that they had won the presidential election based on results they said they collected from agents in the field.

As they danced to music blasting from speakers set up on a truck, police with water cannon circulated in the area.

"North Korea last week returned 55 boxes said to contain the remains of U.S. service members who fought in the Korean War.

But only a single dog tag was included in the delivery -- with no other information to help identify each individual, a U.S. defense official said Tuesday.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it would probably take months, if not years, for U.S. forensics experts to fully determine individual identities from the remains, which have not yet been confirmed by U.S. specialists to be those of American service members.

""We don't know who's in those boxes."" - Jim Mattis, U.S. Defense Secretary

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week that the return of the remains was a welcome development in U.S.-North Korea relations, but not a guarantee that the remains were those of U.S. war dead.

""We don't know who's in those boxes,"" Mattis said.

He noted that some could turn out to be remains of missing service members from other nations that fought in the Korean War in the early 1950s.

""They could go to Australia,"" Mattis said. ""They have missing, France has missing, Americans have. There's a whole lot of us. So, this is an international effort to bring closure for those families.""

During the Korean War, combat troops of 16 other United Nations-member countries fought alongside U.S. service members on behalf of South Korea. Some of them, including Australia, Belgium, France and the Philippines, have yet to recover some of their war dead from North Korea.

The anonymous defense official also did not know details about the single dog tag, including the name on it, or whether it was even that of an American military member.

The 55 boxes were handed over at Wonsan, North Korea, last Friday and flown aboard a U.S. military transport plane to Osan Air Base in South Korea, where U.S. officials catalogued the contents.

After a repatriation ceremony at Osan on Wednesday, the remains will be flown to Hawaii where they will undergo in-depth forensic analysis, in some cases using mitochondrial DNA profiles, at a Defense Department laboratory to attempt to establish individual identifications.

Many families who are awaiting the return of their loved ones from the Korean War have already submitted DNA samples to the laboratory to aid in the process, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.

North Korea provided the 55 boxes in a delayed fulfillment of a commitment its leader, Kim Jong Un, made to President Trump at their Singapore summit on June 12.

Nearly 7,700 U.S. service members were listed as missing and unaccounted for from the 1950-53 Korean War.

The Pentagon estimates that of the approximately 7,700 U.S. MIAs from the Korean War, about 5,300 are unaccounted for on North Korean soil.

The war killed millions, including 36,000 American soldiers, according to the Star Tribune.

Richard Downes, whose father, Air Force Lt. Hal Downes, is among the Korean War missing, said this turnover of remains, having drawn worldwide attention, has the potential to put the U.S. back on track to finding and eventually identifying many more.

Downes, 70, was 3½ when his father's B-26 Invader went down on Jan. 13, 1952, northeast of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.

His family was left to wonder about his fate. Downes, now executive director of the Coalition of Families of Korean and Cold War POW/MIAs, which advocates for remains recovery, said he hopes the boxes that arrive in Hawaii on Wednesday prove to be a vanguard that leads to a fuller accounting for families.

"Pope Francis, in a reversal of church teaching, said in a new policy published Thursday the death penalty is always “inadmissible” because it “attacks” the dignity of all people.

Previously, the Catechism of the Catholic Church said it didn’t exclude recourse to capital punishment “if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor.” The new teaching now states there are other ways to protect common good.

“Consequently the church teaches, in the light of the Gospel, that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person,” the new policy reads.

The Vatican defended the policy, saying it wasn’t contradicting past teaching but evolving it.

“If, in fact the political and social situation of the past made the death penalty an acceptable means for the protection of the common good, today the increasing understanding that the dignity of a person is not lost even after committing the most serious crimes,” said Cardinal Luis Ladaria, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

Francis has long been an opponent of the death penalty, saying it could never be justified no matter how bad the crime is.

At a 2017 ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the publication of the catechism, Francis said the death penalty violates the Gospel and amounts to the voluntary killing of a human life, which “is always sacred in the eyes of the creator.”

Just two months ahead of Brazil's presidential election, leading candidates are struggling to find anybody willing to be their running mates.

Big names who have shunned offers to run for vice president include generals, businessmen, an astronaut, a famous actor and even a descendent of Brazil's royal family.

Even though three of the last five Brazilian leaders came to office as vice presidents, potential candidates this year have cited reasons ranging from family matters to opposition by their parties, all saying effectively, ""Thanks, but no thanks.""

The apparent disinterest in hitching one's reputation to any candidate comes at a time when the political class in Latin America's largest nation is deeply unpopular after years of corruption scandals.

The race is also up in the air because poll-leading former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is in prison and likely to be barred from running.

The candidate struggling most to find a viable running mate appears to be Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain who presents himself as an outsider despite being in Congress since 1991. Promises to crack down on corruption and crime have gained him a large following and put him second in the polls, but he has come under strong criticism for numerous racist, sexist and homophobic comments over the years.

Bolsonaro was fined for telling a female member of Congress in 2014 that she was so ugly she ""didn't deserve to be raped."" More recently, in April the attorney general charged him with racism and discrimination for comments about blacks, indigenous people, refugees, women and gays. Bolsonaro often defends himself by arguing the press takes his statements out of context.

""The cost of associating with a candidate like him, homophobic and machista, is very high,"" said Sergio Praca, a political science professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university in Rio de Janeiro. ""Being Bolsonaro's vice presidential candidate and losing (the election) would be bad for anybody.""

That apprehension was on display with one of Bolsonaro's early picks, reserve Gen. Augusto Heleno. After a public courtship by Bolsonaro, Heleno said last month that he had to decline because his party didn't approve the alliance.

Coalitions are vital in Brazilian politics because there are more than three dozen parties — more than 20 of them large enough to have some representation in Congress.

Presidential candidates often seek to cement those alliances with a vice presidential hopeful from a separate party. The size of the allied party also matters because the free campaign air time granted by law is based on current seats in Congress.

Alliances can be risky though. Current President Michel Temer took over as vice president in 2016 when President Dilma Rousseff was impeached and removed for illegal management of the federal budget. Rousseff and others from her left-leaning Workers' Party accused Temer, from a large centrist party, of being part of the plot against her. Temer denies the accusations.

Bolsonaro, who has promised to fill his government with current and former military people, has courted a second reserve general, Hamilton Mourao. Disagreements between the two men's parties initially nixed an alliance, though local reports say they are still discussing the possibility.

Bolsonaro has also reportedly courted Marcos Pontes, who was Brazil's first astronaut; Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Braganca, an heir to Brazil's last emperor; and lawyer Janaina Paschoal, who wrote impeachment legislation that eventually led to the removal of Rousseff.

A spokeswoman for Bolsonaro declined to comment on deliberations for a running mate.

Bolsonaro is not the only one struggling. Marina Silva, a former environmental minister running third in the polls, reportedly tried to recruit actor Marcos Palmeira and was rejected.

Geraldo Alckmin, former Sao Paulo governor, publicly tried to court Josue Gomes, who apart from being a successful businessman is also the son of former Vice President Jose Alencar. Gomes published an opinion piece in the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo supporting Alckmin but declining to run for personal reasons.

""In the case of Alckmin, he is struggling to show electoral viability,"" said Mauricio Santoro, a political science professor at Rio de Janeiro's state university. ""He has not been able to convince people he is a good bet.""

Potential running mates can't be blamed for being skeptical. Silva ran for president in 2010 and 2014 and came in third both times. In his 2006 bid for president, Alckmin got fewer votes in the second-round runoff with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva than he did in the crowded first round.

Alckmin's campaign declined comment on the search, and Silva's did not respond to messages.

The race has a huge wild card in da Silva, who in April began serving a 12-year sentence for a corruption conviction. While he is barred from running by law, da Silva's Workers' Party insists he will be its candidate.

However, many analysts believe party leaders may name former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad as the vice presidential pick and then make him the presidential candidate once Brazil's electoral court officially denies the candidacy of da Silva, universally called Lula by Brazilians.

""The prospects for this election are still murky,"" said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper, a university in Sao Paulo. ""The question mark is Lula, who should not be a candidate, but we don't know what will happen.""",world
"Zimbabwe's president said Thursday his government has been in touch with the main opposition leader in an attempt to ease tensions after deadly election-related violence, a day after he accused the opposition of inciting it.

Soldiers cleared people from the streets of downtown Harare after they swept in and used gunfire on Wednesday to disperse protesters angry over alleged vote-rigging in Monday's peaceful election, the first without longtime leader Robert Mugabe on the ballot.

The Commonwealth joined other election observers in urging Zimbabwe to release results of the presidential vote as soon as possible to reduce the tensions, saying delays will increase speculation that results were manipulated. The electoral commission said the results would come ""very soon.""

By law the commission has five days from the vote to release them, but both observers and the opposition have asked why presidential results were counted first but are being released last.

In a series of posts on Twitter, President Emmerson Mnangagwa said ""we have been in communication"" with challenger Nelson Chamisa and that ""we must maintain this dialogue in order to protect the peace we hold dear.""

The conciliatory remarks came a day after soldiers shot live rounds and beat demonstrators, many of whom threw rocks and set fires to protest alleged election fraud. The government has said three people were killed.

The violence erupted after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission said the ruling ZANU-PF party won a majority in parliament. The commission has said the vote was free and fair.

A credible vote is crucial to the lifting of international sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe so that its collapsed economy can recover. Elections under Mugabe's 37-year rule were marked by violence against the opposition and alleged fraud.

Mnangagwa called for an ""independent investigation"" into the violence in Harare, saying those responsible ""should be identified and brought to justice.""

Human rights activists and some international observers, meanwhile, criticized the military for opening fire on unarmed civilians in what they said was a disproportionate reaction to the protests and rioting.

Soldiers fired ""randomly"" and beat up bystanders who were not involved in the protests, said the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum.

""Yesterday's events leave ordinary citizens with serious doubts that this government is any different from its predecessor, if not worse,"" the forum said, referring to the long rule of Mugabe, who resigned in November under military pressure.

The head of the Commonwealth election observers in Zimbabwe, former Ghana leader John Dramani Mahama, condemned what he called the ""excessive use of force"" against protesters and said all sides should act with restraint.

Britain's minister for Africa, Harriett Baldwin, said she was ""deeply concerned"" about the deadly violence and urged political leaders to ensure calm and restraint ""at this critical moment.""

The U.S. Embassy appealed to Americans to avoid Harare's central business district and said ""the political situation in Zimbabwe remains uncertain.""

There was a heavy police presence around the headquarters of Chamisa's opposition Movement for Democratic Change party.

The military deployment was the first time that soldiers had appeared in the streets of the capital since Mugabe's departure in November. At that time, thousands of jubilant residents welcomed the soldiers as liberators.

Now some Harare residents, standing amid the shattered windows of Wednesday's violence, expressed frustration and exhaustion.

""We are tired of these people. They have to go, they have to go, the ZANU-PF regime,"" said a 23-year-old who gave his name only as Elliott. ""Because 29 years of oppressing the people of Zimbabwe, we are tired, we are saying we are tired.""

Another resident, 29-year-old Sifas Gavanga, said: ""We are a peaceful nation. We don't deserve the death we saw that happened yesterday.""

Zimbabwean authorities now say the military will remain in the capital until ""this situation is over.""",world
"Venezuela's government reported Saturday afternoon that several explosions, heard at a speech given by President Nicolas Maduro, were an attempted attack on him.

""This was an attempt to kill me,"" Maduro, who was unharmed, said in an address to his nation Saturday, according to The Associated Press. ""Today they attempted to assassinate me.""

Maduro is blaming far-right factions in his beleaguered socialist nation for the attack.

He said evidence gathered thus far ""points to the far right"" working in conjunction with Colombians in the neighboring Andean nation. Maduro said he believed Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was also responsible.

He added that arrests had been made and promised a full investigation, ""no matter who falls.""

Maduro said the factions in Venezuela were working with conspirators in Bogota, and in Miami. Asserting that some of those who financed tyhe attack had links to Miami, he said he hoped President Trump is ""willing to fight the terrorist groups.""

AP said Colombians officials have not yet commented on the accusation. Santos has become one of Maduro's most outspoken critics.

Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said in a live broadcast Saturday that several dronelike devices armed with explosives detonated near Maduro during his appearance at a military event, according to AP.

It quoted Rodriguez as saying Maduro was safe and unharmed. According to Reuters, seven National Guard soldiers were hurt.

Firefighters at the scene were disputing the government's account, AP said.

Maduro, according to AP's account of events, was giving a speech in the capital of Caracas during a celebration of the National Guard's 81st anniversary. He was wearing the presidential banner.

""To the conscious Venezuela, we are going to bet for the good of our country, the hour of the economic recovery has come and we need..."" Maduro was saying before the cameras quickly moved away from him.

He was next to his wife and other officials for the event. AP said a video showed his wife, Cilia Florez, appear to wince, and then she and the president both began looking up toward an unidentified sound.

Soldiers lined up for the event broke ranks, and the transmission of the event abruptly ended.

Venezuela, a once-wealthy oil nation, is in the grips of a five-year crisis under President Maduro's socialist government. Venezuelans struggle to afford scarce food and medicine under soaring inflation. Living with malnutrition and hyperinflation, many Venezuelans have crossed borders into Colombia and other neighboring nations.

"During a visit to New Zealand, Polish President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday defended the moves his nation's government have made to take control of the judicial system.

Poland's conservative government lowered the retirement age for Supreme Court judges from 70 to 65 as part of a broader judicial overhaul which has put it in conflict with the European Union. Poland's Supreme Court this month suspended implementation of the legislation, which would force more than one-third of the court's justices to retire.

Duda told reporters in Auckland that 80 percent of Polish society believes that deep reform of the judicial system is absolutely necessary.

Speaking through an interpreter, Duda said a group of prominent judges were losing influence because they were retiring.

""They're not happy with that, because they are people in high positions who have been members of the Polish judicial system for a very long time,"" he said. ""They were also very deeply involved in the judicial system back in the 1970s when Poland was oppressed by the communists, and these people were also very often members of the Communist Party.""

The EU is increasing pressure on Poland over what it sees as flaws in the law, and last week gave Warsaw a month to act before facing possible court action.

The EU Commission said the law falls short of the values guiding the 28-nation bloc, and said that Poland's explanation ""does not alleviate the Commission's legal concerns."" It said a case could be opened at the EU's highest court in a month.

Duda said the Polish government was fulfilling one of its basic promises.

""I think what we are going through now can be compared to the flu,"" Duda said. ""I hope we are able to recover from this flu and not contract another one.""

Duda also defended Poland's immigration policies, after the nation opted out of Europe's migration settlement schemes.

Duda made the comments after meeting New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. He's visiting New Zealand until Thursday after earlier visiting Australia.",world

The leader of Syria's al-Qaida affiliate has vowed to fight on in Idlib province, the country's last major rebel stronghold, in the face of a possible government offensive there.

The rare public statement by Abu Mohammed al-Golani came as Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces have been sending reinforcements into areas around Idlib in the country's northwest, along the border with Turkey.

The United States, Britain and France have expressed concern at reports of the Syrian military targeting civilians, schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure in Idlib and underlined ""concern at the potential for further — and illegal — use of chemical weapons"" to bring the province under government control.

Earlier this year, Syrian government forces captured rebel-held suburbs of the capital, Damascus, as well as the southern provinces of Daraa, Quneitra and Sweida.

In parts of these regions, rebels accepted to reconcile with the government, handing over their heavy weapons in return for amnesty — or agreed to be bussed out together with their families and other civilians to rebel-held areas in Idlib.

But taking Idlib would be a much more difficult challenge for Assad's forces as the province is also the base of al-Golani's militant and heavily armed Levant Liberation Committee as the al-Qaida branch in Syria is known.

In his comments, which came in a video released late on Tuesday, al-Golani said state-sponsored surrenders of rebel groups, similar to those that recently occurred elsewhere in Syria, won't happen in Idlib as such actions would be considered ""treason"" by his al-Qaida-linked fighters.

Earlier this month, the Syrian government dropped leaflets over Idlib, urging residents to reconcile with its authority. Officials have warned government forces would take back the province by force if necessary.

According to U.N. estimates, 2.9 million people live in Idlib and surrounding opposition-held areas. The U.N. has appealed to Turkey to open its border to refugees, should the Syrian government decide to attack the province.

Turkey, which has established itself as a sponsor of rebels in northern Syria, already hosts some 3.5 million Syrian refugees - the most of any nation. It has also established 12 monitoring posts in Idlib and deployed 1,000 troops in the province.

In the video, released on the occasion of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, al-Golani is seen wearing an olive-green military uniform and saying that ""Turkish monitoring towers"" cannot be relied on to take on Assad's forces.

""Our weapons are the source of our strength and honor,"" al-Golani says. ""Thinking about surrendering to the enemy and handing over weapons will be considered treason.""

Meanwhile, another militant figure from the al-Qaida-linked group, Abu Yaqzan al-Masri, was unharmed when a gunman opened fire at him and missed on Tuesday. The shooter was detained, according to Mazan al-Shami, an opposition activist based in northwestern Syria.

Dozens of members of the group have been killed over the past few months in attacks blamed on its main jihadi rival, the Islamic State group.",world

Indonesia's largest Muslim organization has criticized the blasphemy conviction and imprisonment of a Buddhist woman who complained that the call to prayer from her neighborhood mosque was too loud.

Officials from Nahdlatul Ulama, which claims 60 million members, said Thursday the woman's complaint about mosque loudspeakers doesn't constitute blasphemy under Indonesian law.

The ethnic Chinese woman, Meiliana, was sentenced to 18 months in prison on Tuesday by a court in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra province, providing new fuel to concerns that an intolerant brand of Islam is gaining ground in Indonesia.

The country's constitution guarantees freedom of speech and religion, but religious minorities are frequently the target of blasphemy prosecutions. The overwhelming majority of cases end with guilty verdicts.

Word of the woman's original comments in July 2016 sparked a riot in Tanjung Bali, a port town on Sumatra. Mobs burned and ransacked at least 14 Buddhist temples in the town.

""We believe that Meiliana did not commit blasphemy,"" Robikin Emhas, a deputy chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, told The Associated Press.

He said a complaint about a speaker's volume for the five-times-a-day call to prayer does not contain any element of hatred against a religion.

""I regret this matter has been brought to the court, it actually should be settled in a peaceful way,"" Emhas said.

Prosecutors had accused the 44-year-old defendant of violating the criminal code by committing blasphemy against Islam, the dominant faith in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation. About 85 percent of Indonesians are Muslim, but Protestants, Catholics, Hindus and Buddhists are each numerically significant minorities.

Another prominent Nahdlatul Ulama official, Rumadi Ahmad, who was an expert witness at Meiliana's trial, said in a Facebook post that his testimony was ignored.

""Meiliana, forgive me,"" he wrote. ""You have become a sacrifice, just ahead of the Islamic holiday Eid-al-Adha.""

He said under Islamic law the call to prayer itself is not part of highest religious teachings that must be followed so does not fall under the blasphemy law. The woman's complaint in conversation with a few people also could not be considered a blasphemous public advocacy against a religion, Ahmad said.

Since 2004, 147 people have been imprisoned under blasphemy or related laws, according to monitoring by Human Rights Watch. The number of cases has slowed since 2014 under President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo's administration.

Muhammadiyah, the second-largest Muslim organization, said the legal process should be respected but also called for tolerance.

""People should understand that the call to prayer, or ""azan,"" must be heard by the congregation. But how loud the sound is needs to be a dialogue between communities,"" chairman Haedar Nashir said in a statement.",world

A political battle is brewing in flood-ravaged south India, with the ruling party in Kerala state protesting the central government's refusal to accept $100 million in relief offered by foreign governments.

""It is only natural for nations to help each other,"" said Kerala's top elected official, Pinyari Vijayan, as residents waded into the immense cleanup effort after floods killed more than 200 people and drove more than 800,000 into relief shelters.

The state finance minister said the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi must either accept a $100 million aid offer from the United Arab Emirates, or compensate Kerala by that amount.

Trying to shed its longtime image as a poverty-wracked nation, India has refused to accept aid from foreign governments since a 2004 tsunami, when New Delhi told potential government donors that India would contact them if it needed financial aid.

India is ""is committed to meeting the requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts,"" foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said in a statement Wednesday night.

""The government of India deeply appreciates offers from several countries, including from foreign governments, to assist in relief and rehabilitation efforts after the tragic floods in Kerala,"" he continued.

India has said individuals and foundations are welcome to send donations.

The torrential rains which began Aug. 8 in Kerala slowed early this week and floodwaters have been receding. But vast swaths of the tropical state, known for its idyllic villages and beautiful beaches, remain coated with mud, and many people have no clean drinking water or electricity.

The Kerala state government, run by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), expressed disappointment after Modi offered the state 6 billion rupees, roughly $85 million, or about one-fourth of the 22 billion rupees it requested.

Isaac said the state government had made no requests for foreign assistance, but the UAE offered 7 billion rupees, about $100 million.

""It is below our dignity to accept foreign aid,"" he said in a tweet, mimicking and ridiculing the central government.

Qatar has offered India $5 million aid, and Indian media reports say the Maldives and Thailand have also said they could provide financial support.

The UAE has a large population of expatriate Indian workers, many of them from Kerala.

While individuals and foundations in the UAE have pledged millions of dollars in aid, its central government has not acknowledged making any direct donation offers. Emirati officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday during the Eid al-Adha holiday.

Italy has made headlines as a hard place for migrants recently, with racist attacks against blacks on its soil and a new government closing Italian ports to people rescued in the Mediterranean Sea.

But not all Italians are on board, and some are even reaching out to migrants.

Barbara di Clemente, a 79-year-old grandmother, opened her heart and home to Moriba Mamadou Diarra from Mali, hosting him at her two-bedroom apartment in Rome for the past four months. The 18-year-old says he fled his country because there, his ""rights had been denied"" and he couldn't study and build a better future for himself.

She says that taking in Diarra, who dreams of playing professional soccer, has been her own way of helping someone in need while making a political statement against Italy's populist, anti-migrant government. Di Clemente is among a growing number of Italians who have applied to host young migrants, stepping in to fill a gap in government services even as the number of new arrivals to Italy plummets.

""Something in my soul spoke to me,"" Di Clemente said of her decision to host Diarra, adding that having lived through World War II, she is particularly sensitive to wars and poverty.

She contacted Refugees Welcome, a humanitarian group founded in Germany in 2015 that helps organize migrant hosting and now has chapters in 16 countries. The Italian chapter, which normally registers one or two hosting offers per day by Italians, saw an 80 percent spike in offers since the June 10 decision by Interior Minister Matteo Salvini to turn away a rescue vessel carrying more than 600 migrants rescued from the Mediterranean.

Sara Consolato, the group's spokeswoman, says volunteers want to show the migrants that not all Italians agree with the government's hard line. ""They are a minority, but they exist,"" she said. ""They don't identify with these policies and they feel the time has come to take action.""

Some gestures don't rise to letting a complete stranger move in but are no less significant, and have come amid a spate of racist attacks against blacks and non-Italians. A coffee shop owner in Adria in northern Veneto — a region that has long supported Salvini's anti-migrant League party — started printing out cash register receipts last month stamped with ""No to racism, yes to an integrated Adria."" Another local businessman took out newspaper ads with the same message.

Although the League's popularity has soared since it took power with the populist 5-Star Movement after March 4 elections, some 72 percent of Italians support the principle of asylum and 61 percent feel concerned about the rise of racism and discrimination, according to a survey by pollster Ipsos MORI and commissioned by More in Common, a nonprofit organization that works against xenophobia.

However, the survey also found that only 18 percent of respondents view the impact of immigration on the country positively. The survey consisted of online and phone surveys of 2,000 people between 2017 and 2018. The margin of error was between 0.4 and 2.1 percent.

Di Clemente, a retired therapist, said that while watching the news she had thought several times about welcoming a refugee in her home. After a check-up by Refugees Welcome, Diarra was assigned to her apartment in Rome.

""We introduced ourselves, and I told him: 'My heart is racing, and yours?' And he said: 'Mine, too,'"" Di Clemente recalled of their first meeting.

She set two basic rules right away: No smoking, no drugs.

""The truth is that I don't smoke, so I felt good about moving in with her,"" Diarra said.

He said he loves their frequent trips to a nearby sports center, where he trains and plays soccer.

""Soccer is what gives me the strength to get up in the morning, to go study, to work,"" he said, wearing the jersey of the Italian national soccer team. ""It pushes me to become a better person.""

Diarra was among some 15,000 unaccompanied minors who arrived in Italy by boat in 2017. For a few months, he lived in a residence for migrant children in Rome, where he attended school and studied Italian.

When he turned 18, he was transferred to a reception center for asylum-seekers, a 90-minute drive from Rome, where he said he received very little support in his attempt to learn Italian and integrate into society. He was relieved to return to Rome.

Living together presented some challenges. At first, Di Clemente was bothered by Diarra's reluctance to look into her eyes when they spoke. Diarra explained that in his culture young people don't face older people out of respect, but the woman insisted that he adapt to Italian culture. She said she also taught him to do the Italian double-cheek kiss.

Diarra, a practicing Muslim, observed the fasting month of Ramadan earlier this year, despite Di Clemente's concerns that he should not attend soccer practice while fasting. He decided to compromise by breaking the fast on training days and adding a number of fast days after the holiday.

In the kitchen, Di Clemente appreciates their cultural differences. ""The things he cooks are better than what I cook,"" she said with a laugh.

Diarra now works at a summer camp by day and plays soccer in the evening, as he waits for his asylum application to be processed.

According to data released by Vatican charity organization Caritas, the Interior Ministry rejected more than half of the 41,379 requests in the first half of 2017. It granted refugee status to only 9 percent of the applicants, while the remainder obtained a residency permit for ""humanitarian"" or other motives.

Most applicants reside in reception centers across the country. After receiving the papers, they can apply to enter centers of ""secondary reception,"" but fewer spots are available there, and some end up living in tent camps.

Despite criticism from many humanitarian groups, Interior Minister Salvini — whose motto is a Trump-like ""Italians First"" — has recently announced that the government will limit benefits to the migrants who have already received protection status. He's also vowed to reduce aid for asylum seekers. Salvini often uses the phrase ""The party is over"" when he refers to migrants.

Paolo Morozzo della Rocca, the Rome-based supervisor of migrant services of the Sant'Egidio Catholic charity, said it's counterproductive to keep migrants in a limbo without helping them to build a future for themselves.

Diarra, who stressed his belief in the importance of learning Italian and integrating into Italian society, said he doesn't pay attention to what Salvini says.

""I don't like him,"" Diarra said. ""He speaks in the name of the Italian people, but I don't think the Italian people are like that.""",world

In what would have been unthinkable in India before the Asian Games, there'll be no kabaddi gold medals for the spiritual home of the sport.

A day after Iran stunned the seven-time champion Indian men in the semifinals, the Iranians won the women's title with a 27-24 thriller over India on Friday.

Too bad for India, which has long dominated a sport that blends tag and tackle with wrestling moves.

The Indian women took an early 7-3 lead but Iran rallied to take a 17-13 margin and eventually held on in a tense finish for victory.

The Iranian men were playing for gold against South Korea later Friday. The Koreans in the group stage became the first team ever to beat India's men's team at the Asian Games. This is the first time since the sport was introduced in 1990 that India won't win a gold.

India's woes continued when former No. 1-ranked Kidambi Srikanth was upset 23-21, 21-19 in the second round of men's singles in the badminton by Vincent Wong of Hong Kong.

The sixth day of competition was expected to be headlined by Japanese teenager Rikako Ikee and her bid for a sixth gold medal, and a record-equaling eighth medal at a single Asian Games.

Ikee led qualifiers in the heats of the women's 50-meter freestyle.

China's three-time Olympic champion Sun Yang was aiming for his fourth freestyle gold medal of the games, hoping to add the 1,500 title to his victories in the 200, 400 and 800.

Until Friday, no cyclist had won both the road race and the individual time trial at the same Asian Games. Now two cyclists have done it.

Two days after her road race victory, South Korea's Na Ah-reum won the women's time trial at Subang in West Java from Eri Yonamine of Japan and Leung Wing Yee of Hong Kong.

Kazakstan's Alexey Lutsenko made it back-to-back golds on back-to-back days by winning the men's time trial from Muradjan Khalmuratov of Uzbekistan and Japan's Fumiyuki Beppu, whom he edged in a sprint finish to the road race 24 hours earlier.

Japan won its fifth consecutive Asian Games softball gold medal with a 7-0 shutout against Taiwan.

The first Asian Games gold medal ever awarded the Asian Games, and Cambodia's first medal for the 2018 games, went to Jessa Khan, who beat Mahra Alhinaai of the United Arab Emirates in the women's 49-kilogram class.

Kim Hyo Sim won North Korea's fifth gold medal in weightlifting with victory in the women's 63-kilogram division.

Kim collected gold with a total of 250 kilograms, well clear of fellow North Korean Choe Hyo Sim, who was a silver medalist at the 2016 Olympics and the 2015 world championships.

With China barred from the weightlifting competition for doping violations, the North Koreans are atop the standings in the sport.

The first doping case of the Jakarta-Palembang games was registered against a wrestler from Turkmenistan. The Olympic Council of Asia said Rustem Nazarov, who lost in the quarterfinals of the 57-kilogram division, was disqualified from the games after testing positive for the banned diuretic furosemide in a test on the eve of the opening ceremony.

There were six doping cases at the last Asian Games held at Incheon, South Korea, in 2014.

Many of the 150 migrants stranded aboard a coast guard ship for a ninth day began a hunger strike Friday out of frustration that Italy won't let them disembark in Sicily unless fellow European Union nations first pledge to take them, authorities said, in the latest standoff provoked by Italy's anti-migrant interior minister.

""They can do whatever they believe,"" Interior Minister Matteo Salvini tweeted, shrugging off the development that migrants were refusing meals aboard the Italian coast guard vessel Diciotti. The ship rescued them on Aug. 16 from a foundering human trafficker's boat in the central Mediterranean, and for days now has been docked in the port of Catania, Sicily.

An opposition lawmaker, Sen. Davide Faraone said that on Friday Catania port officials told him ""there's tension"" on the ship and that migrants have stopped eating.

Thirteen young children and ailing adults were evacuated from the Diciotti early in the drama. On Wednesday, 27 minors, all teenagers, were allowed to disembark in Catania. Salvini has been adamant that Italy's populist government won't allow any of the 150 adults still aboard the vessel disembark unless other EU nations commit to taking the asylum-seekers.

All but about 18 of those aboard are Eritrean; the others are from Somalia, Syria and Sudan. They have told authorities they suffered months and even years of inhumane treatment in detention in Libya, while waiting to leave that lawless country aboard smugglers' boats.

Another opposition lawmaker who went aboard on Thursday expressed particular concern about 11 women, some as young as 19 or 20, still there.

Appealing to Salvini, Laura Boldrini said: ""As a father, they could be your daughter. At least let the young women off"" the Diciotti.

Sky TG24 TV said some women aboard ate lunch Friday but the men refused the meal.

But Salvini was staying tough, as was fellow deputy premier, Luigi Di Maio, who heads the senior coalition partner, the euro-skeptic 5-Star Movement.

Di Maio threatened that Italy could withhold some of its yearly 20 billion euro ($23 billion) contribution to the bloc if EU nations didn't make good on promises earlier this year for more solidarity toward the Italians, who have seen more than 600,000 rescued migrants brought to Italian shores in recent years.

If the European Commission meeting doesn't ""decide anything about the Diciotti ship and the re-distribution of the migrants, I and all the 5-Star Movement are no longer willing to give 20 billion to the European Union,"" Di Maio said.

In Brussels, EU Commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein retorted that ""the European Union is a community of rules and it operates on the basis of rules, not threats."" He urged ""all parties involved to work constructively together to find a swift solution.""

A meeting in Brussels Friday of lower-officials from 12 countries, including Italy, was grappling with how to share the migrant burden among EU members. The meeting wasn't called to deal with the Diciotti standoff, but was expected to discuss it.

"Robert Wilkie has served as acting secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs since March — and now his position is permanent.

On July 23, the Senate confirmed Wilkie to lead the VA, the government's second-largest department, with 360,000 employees serving 9 million veterans.



Wilkie, 55, has led the department since Trump announced his decision to replace David Shulkin. Then, Trump said he intended to nominate presidential physician, Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, to lead Veterans Affairs, but Jackson eventually withdrew his name from consideration following controversy.

Read on for a look at four things to know about the Wilkie.

He served in the Air Force and Navy

Wilkie served in the United States Naval Reserve, according to his Defense Department biography.

He would later join the Air Force as a reserve officer and was assigned to the Office of the Chief of Staff, his biography said.

He holds a masters in strategic studies from the United States Army War College. Wilkie is also a graduate of Wake Forest University, Georgetown University and Loyola University in New Orleans.

He is also the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness

Wilkie took over as Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness in November 2017. According to his Defense Department biography, he advises the Secretary of Defense for Total Force Management on the National Guard, training, health issues and personnel requirements.

WHO’S IN TRUMP’S CABINET? A FULL LIST OF THE PRESIDENT’ STOP ADVISERS

In 2005, Wilkie was tapped to serve as assistant secretary of the Defense Department. He was the youngest senior leader in the department at the time, his biography states.

He worked for a massive engineering firm

Wilkie was vice president for strategic programs for CH2M HILL, a global engineering company, from 2010 to 2015, according to the Raleigh News & Observer.

Some of his assignments included reforming the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense Supply and Logistics System, his biography explains.

Wilkie also worked on the Hill

Wilkie worked for Sen. Trent Lott, then the Majority Leader, from 1997 to 2003, according to the News & Observer. He also served as an aide to former Sen. Jesse Helms and former Rep. David Funderburk.

Additionally, Wilkie was executive director of the North Carolina GOP, the newspaper reported.

In 1996, Wilkie unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Congress, the News & Observer reported.",politics
"A jury has been seated in the high-stakes trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, with opening statements set to begin as early as Tuesday afternoon.

Jury selection moved swiftly as the trial kicked off at a federal courthouse in northern Virginia, refocusing the special counsel probe for at least the next several weeks on the veteran operative’s alleged tax evasion and eye-popping spending habits – but not Russia’s 2016 election meddling.

The jury is composed of six men and six women, with four alternates.

Manafort, who arrived early in the morning in a grey van with tinted windows, wore a suit and was seated with his lawyers.

Judge T.S. Ellis III instructed the pool of roughly 75 potential jurors earlier Tuesday that “nothing is more important than jury duty as an American.”

The trial is the first arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. It represents a major test not just for Manafort, who faces decades in prison on bank and tax fraud charges if convicted, but also for Mueller, whose ongoing probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election could lose credibility if jurors ultimately acquit Manafort.

The Mueller team in Alexandria is being led by Andrew Weissmann, whose specialties included fraud and organized crime before Mueller enlisted him. Manafort’s defense team is led by Kevin Downing.

President Trump repeatedly has called the Mueller probe a ""witch hunt,"" and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has suggested the investigation is ""rigged.""

Neither the Virginia trial nor Manafort's separate upcoming trial in Washington, D.C., directly relates to any alleged collusion between Trump officials and the Russian government, or purported Russian disinformation campaigns -- a fact that led to a tense courtroom showdown just months ago.

The judge in the case harshly rebuked members of Mueller's team in a preliminary hearing in May, saying they were pursuing the case against the ex-Trump adviser as a means to target the president.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE MANAFORT TRIAL

""You don't really care about Mr. Manafort,"" Ellis told prosecutors. ""You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever.""

Prosecutor Greg Andres flatly told the judge: ""I don’t anticipate that a government witness will utter the word 'Russia.'""

But Ellis ultimately allowed the case to proceed, saying the prosecution fell within Mueller's broad authority to investigate Russian involvement in U.S. politics.

On Tuesday, jurors were told that all the charges against Manafort are financial in nature.

The trial, which is expected to last about three weeks, centers on accusations that Manafort intentionally hid millions of dollars he earned from the Ukrainian government and oligarchs to lobby on behalf of since-deposed pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych.

Prosecutors say they will show that Manafort failed to report a ""significant percentage"" of the nearly $60 million in income from his Ukraine work on his tax returns, and did not properly indicate that he maintained bank accounts in foreign countries.

WITNESS LIST GIVES GLIMPSE AT MANAFORT TRIAL STRATEGY

They also alleged that Manafort committed bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy in several instances.

Rick Gates, Manafort's former business partner, pleaded guilty earlier this year in the probe and cut a deal with prosecutors. He is one of 35 witnesses that the Mueller team said it may call during the trial.

Other witnesses Mueller has signaled may testify include those with information about Manafort's allegedly lavish spending habits. Five potential witnesses were offered and granted immunity in the case, including former Manafort accountants.

Manafort has been held in solitary confinement for alleged witness tampering by the judge in his pending D.C. trial, Judge Amy Berman Jackson. Manafort's attorneys have said his confinement has been unnecessary and unduly harsh, and has impeded his ability to communicate with his defense team.

Observers have questioned whether Trump will pardon Manafort if he is convicted. Trump has said he feels ""badly"" about Manafort's situation, and that he considers it unfair that he has been ensnared by Mueller's probe.

"President Trump on Tuesday voiced concern about 3D-printed guns being available to the public, saying he has talked to the National Rifle Association and it “doesn’t seem to make much sense.”

""I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!"" he tweeted.



On Monday, eight states filed suit against the administration over its decision to allow Defense Distributed to publish downloadable blueprints for guns online. The suit argues that the weapons assist terrorists and criminals, and essentially nullify state gun control laws.

Separately, Democratic attorneys general in 21 states urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to pull back from the settlement.

3D-PRINTED GUN BLUEPRINTS CAN BE DOWNLOADED, ENDING LENGTHY LEGAL BATTLE



The founder of the Texas-based company first published designs for a 3D-printed gun in 2013, which was subsequently printed approximately 100,000 times until he was ordered to stop by the State Department. The June settlement allows the company to resume posting the blueprints.



The company meanwhile, filed its own suit on Sunday, claiming it is the victim of an ""ideologically-fueled program of intimidation and harassment"" that violates the company's First Amendment rights.



Founder Cody Wilson told The Washington Post that the controversy is not about gun regulation and safety risks: “It’s about access to information.”



According to the Post, the Trump administration rejected the First Amendment argument as early as April, noting that the files direct the functioning of a 3D printer and cause it to create firearms. But the settlement nevertheless allows the blueprints to be circulated.



The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence slammed the move as “reckless and stupid.”



“During the Obama years, the government thought that 3D printed guns posed a serious threat to national security. I'm not aware of anything that has changed except who sits in the White House,” Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told Fox News in an emailed statement last month.

“Untraceable and undetectable guns that bypass our bipartisan background check system put us all at risk. The country deserves answers from the Trump Administration about why it thinks this is a good idea. Making it easier for dangerous people to get guns is reckless and stupid, and this is going to make Americans less safe.""

Meanwhile, a State Department spokesperson said Tuesday that the department has ""completed the actions that were required under the settlement agreement in the Defense Distributed litigation.""

Trump’s tweet appears to complicate the matter somewhat, but Democrats didn’t seem appreciative of the support.



“Your administration approved this. What kind of incompetence and dangerous governing is this?” responded Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “And to check with the NRA? Holy moly.”

"Vice President Mike Pence contended Tuesday that President Trump's administration inherited a ""cyber-crisis"" when he took office, laying the blame for Russian meddling on the Obama administration.

“[S]adly, previous administrations have let the American people down when it came to cyber defense,” Pence said in a speech at the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity Summit in New York City. “At the outset of this administration, it became clear from early on: In a very real sense, we inherited a cyber-crisis.”

“Sadly, previous administrations have let the American people down when it came to cyber defense. At the outset of this administration, it became clear from early on: In a very real sense, we inherited a cyber-crisis.” - Vice President Mike Pence

Pence suggested the Obama administration was to blame for major security breaches in recent years, such as the Equifax hack -- which affected the data of half the U.S. population -- and the hack at the federal Office of Personnel Management, which affected about 18 million people, CNet.com reported.

Pence vowed the White House would take proactive measures to overhaul the country’s cyber-security systems, to prevent another attack.

The vice president also derided Russia for interfering in the 2016 presidential election and vowed the Trump administration would do more to prevent future cyber-attacks.

Pence’s denouncement of Russia was unprecedented, given President Trump’s ambiguous stance on election meddling, the Wall Street Journal reported.

“While other nations certainly possess the capability, the fact is Russia meddled in our 2016 elections,” Pence said, “That is the unambiguous judgment of our intelligence community, and, as the president said, we accept the intelligence community’s conclusion.”

Trump was widely criticized for appearing to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's assurance that Russia had not interfered in the 2016 election – just days after Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officials. But following widespread backlash, Trump reversed his position.

At the same New York event, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced several initiatives to combat future threats, Politico reported, including an election security task force, a supply chain task force and a National Risk Management center.

The risk management center will reportedly work to safeguard the nation’s banks, energy companies, and other major industries, the Journal reported.

“[O]ur digital lives are now in danger every single day,” Nielsen said, adding that the next 9/11 attack would likely “reach us online” rather “than on an airplane.”

Meanwhile, a group of demonstrators wearing red “Handmaid’s Tale” robes marched outside the summit to protest the Trump administration’s now-rescinded “zero tolerance” policy, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ religious liberty task force.

A group called Refuse Fascism, which organized the protest, maintains that the Trump administration’s “religious liberty” policies are discriminatory towards LGBT people and women, AM New York reported.",politics
"A democratic lawmaker from New Hampshire was arrested Thursday for domestic violence charges after he allegedly bit a woman on multiple occasions and forced his way into her locked home.

State Senator Jeff Woodburn, a Democrat from Whitefield, was charged with simple assault, domestic violence and criminal mischief after the state attorney general’s office said he allegedly slapped a woman, punched her in the stomach, bit her hand, and on another occasion, bit her forearm.

The incidents are said to have taken place this year and last year.

Woodburn, the state Senate minority leader, defended himself Thursday in a statement.

“This afternoon, I learned that a warrant had been issued for my arrest. I voluntarily responded to the police station, cooperated with law enforcement during the booking process, and was released,” he said. “I intend to fully address and defend against these charges in court.”

The New Hampshire Democratic Party urged him to resign, as did the state’s Democratic congressional delegation and members of the state Senate Democratic Caucus.

“The New Hampshire Democratic Party stands firm in our belief that any form of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or domestic violence is completely unacceptable behavior for anyone, let alone our public officials who should all be held to a higher standard,” said State Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley.

Republican Gov. Chris Sununu tweeted that the allegations were “morally reprehensible,” and also said Woodburn should step down.

Woodburn is set to be arraigned on August 20.

"U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein fired a staffer a few years back who was allegedly part of an effort to spy and pass on political intelligence to the Chinese government.

The staffer, based in the Democrat's San Francisco office, was suspected of delivering political intelligence, though nothing top secret, to officials based at the local Chinese Consulate, Politico reported.

The FBI informed Feinstein, the then-chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, about five years ago about the staffer and allegations that the staffer was a spy. The source who confirmed the incident to the San Francisco Chronicle said “Dianne was mortified” upon learning about it.

The suspected spy served as the lawmaker’s driver in California, but took on other roles as well, including helping out in her San Francisco office and being Feinstein’s liaison to the Asian-American community in the state. He attended Chinese Consulate events on behalf of the senator.

A former official said that the spy’s handler “probably got an award back in China” for his efforts to penetrate Feinstein’s office and pass on intelligence.

The driver was reportedly recruited years ago after he being befriended on one of the trips to Asia by someone from China’s Ministry of State Security, the country’s intelligence and security agency, the Chronicle reported.

“He didn’t even know what was happening — that he was being recruited,” a source told the publication. “He just thought it was some friend.”

The FBI wasn’t able to charge the individual, possibly because he was passing on political intelligence rather than classified materials – making the prosecution nearly impossible.

“They interviewed him, and Dianne forced him to retire, and that was the end of it,” the Chronicle’s source said. “None of her staff ever knew what was going on. They just kept it quiet.”",politics
"The race to replace outgoing Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker is on, with Rep. Marsha Blackburn and former Gov. Phil Bredesen vying for the position.

Blackburn was endorsed by President Trump who traveled to Tennessee in May to campaign for her.

This Senate race is considered a toss-up by Fox News. It is among several races crucial to Trump’s plans to maintain control of the Senate, where Republicans are defending a narrow two-seat majority.

Trump won Tennessee with more than 60 percent of the vote in the 2016 presidential election.

Read on for a look at the top two candidates ahead of the November election.

Marsha Blackburn

Rep. Marsha Blackburn, 66, has served in Congress since 2003.

Blackburn was the first woman in the state to win a congressional seat without following a husband in the post, her U.S. House biography states. She serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Trump has already endorsed Blackburn, calling her a “wonderful woman who has always been there when we needed her.” He praised her work on military issues and border security.

Blackburn served on Trump’s transition team and has not shied away from embracing the president. She is one of the lawmakers who signed onto a letter nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize. She’s called herself a “hardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative.”

“Things are shaping up so well” for her Senate campaign, Blackburn told Fox News, adding that she’s excited about the “momentum.” She said she’s confident that a “great red wall” in Tennessee will prevent a “blue wave” of Democrats taking over her state in the midterm elections.

FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTION HEADQUARTERS

Aside from Trump, Blackburn has also gotten an assist from the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity (AFP), a nonprofit advocacy group.

If elected, Blackburn said on her campaign website she would focus on anti-abortion and pro-gun rights issues. Additionally, her focus would be on veterans and supporting Trump’s “immigration ban.”

Prior to her tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives, Blackburn served as a state senator and chair of the Tennessee Film, Entertainment and Music Commission, according to Memphis Magazine.

Phil Bredesen

Former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen is vying to become the first Democrat to win a Senate campaign in The Volunteer State since Al Gore in 1990.

Bredesen, 74, is not hyper-partisan and has promised he is not “running against” the president in campaign ads.

“I’ve been upset with what’s going on in Washington, D.C. It’s been going on for a while; it’s not just Trump or anything like that,” Bredesen told the Johnson City Press. “Most particularly, it just seems [Washington, D.C.] has got to a place where nothing gets done, everyone stands around and yells at the other person.”

TOP TENNESSEE DEM PARTY OFFICIAL SNUBS ‘REACHING OUT’ TO TRUMP VOTERS, CALLS THEM ‘IDIOTS’

Bredesen was first elected governor in 2002, having served as Nashville’s mayor before that. He led Tennessee until 2011. When he won re-election in 2006, Bredesen became the first governor to win all 95 counties in Tennessee, according to his campaign website, which also touts his penchant for working across the aisle on legislative issues. Additionally, Bredesen created a health care management company.

Outgoing Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican, gave a boost to Bredesen in the race as he said the former governor is sure to appeal to at least some GOP voters.

""He was a very good mayor, a very good governor, a very good business person,” Corker told reporters in April. “Look, I’m not going to campaign against someone who I’ve been friends with and worked with.”

Bredesen has said he does “well” with those he calls “economic Republicans, the more traditional-minded Republicans,” given his business background.

“Bob Corker is a perfect example of what I’d call an economic Republican,” he told the Johnson City Press. “He’s sensible, out of the business world and is focused on getting things done. I think there are a lot of people who have voted for him, who still would and who I believe I can attract.”

If elected, Bredesen, who graduated from Harvard University with a physics degree, would be one of the richest members in Congress, The Tennessean reported. Recent financial disclosures showed he has between $88.9 million and $358 million in total investment assets from January 2017 to February 2018.

"EXCLUSIVE: President Trump’s newly installed Veterans Affairs secretary, in his first interview since taking office earlier this week, sounded the alarm about the need to fix a critical program allowing veterans to see local private doctors instead of driving long distances to a VA hospital.

If the federal government falls short, Secretary Robert Wilkie warned, “then the entire system collapses.”

For Wilkie, it’s among the most pressing in an array of challenges he confronts upon taking the helm at the government’s second-largest department – and perhaps its most scandal-scarred.

'If we don’t get a hold of what we owe Americans who are providing services to our veterans, then the entire system collapses.' - VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, on doctor payments

From his office perch two blocks from the White House, Wilkie surveyed the task ahead and homed in on the popular private-doctor program used by millions of veterans. He told Fox News he has promised the president he will address one glaring problem in particular: doctors getting stiffed by the VA.

“The Veterans Affairs Department in the last eight to nine years has not been paying those bills to small-town doctors, to community hospital emergency care facilities,” he said.

WATCH JENNIFER GRIFFIN’S EXCLUSIVE TWO-PART INTERVIEW WITH VA SECRETARY ROBERT WILKIE ON ‘SPECIAL REPORT WITH BRET BAIER’ FRIDAY AT 6 PM ET AND 'FOX NEWS @ NIGHT' WITH SHANNON BREAM AT 11 PM ET.

At issue is a program that was revamped under this administration.

In June, Trump signed a bill to replace the troubled Veterans Choice Program, enacted in 2014 under then-President Barack Obama, to expand access for veterans wishing to see private doctors and other providers to ease the burden on families forced to drive long distances for VA care.

“It makes no sense to me that we require someone to travel -- let's use a state like Montana -- where the distances are enormous, 600 or 700 miles round trip,” said Wilkie. “They pass a lot of doctors along the way. We need to bring those doctors into the Veterans Affairs system.”

Wilkie said, though, if they can’t fix the doctor payment issue and “if we don’t get a hold of what we owe Americans who are providing services to our veterans, then the entire system collapses.”

That’s just the start to his challenges at the sprawling department.

The VA has suffered from a series of high-profile scandals in recent years involving secret wait-lists, systemic neglect and even veterans dying while waiting to see a doctor. Wilkie is the fourth secretary to lead the VA in the past four years.

The VA’s $200 billion budget has doubled in the past decade. The new secretary said of the 370,000 employees under that network, “there are probably 100 bad eggs” in the system still.

One of the first things Wilkie vowed to turn around, though, is a perceived morale problem at the agency that’s supposed to serve 9 million veterans.

""This is an institution that has been buffeted by continuous body blows for a number of years,"" Wilkie admitted.

To tackle the problem, Wilkie plans to be more visible not only at headquarters in Washington but VA hospitals throughout the country. Wilkie said he spent his first day-and-a-half as secretary walking the halls to meet staff, and is joining them for meals in the cafeteria.

“I don't think those simple things have been done,” Wilkie said. “I fall back on my military life. I learned at a very early age, listening to those around my family, that in order to be a commander you had to walk your post.”

Wilkie is the son of an Army field artillery commander, severely wounded after multiple tours in Vietnam.

“He spent a year in Army hospitals. He came back to us weighing about half of what he did when he left. I watched his recovery. It was agonizing,” Wilkie recalled.

So he knows firsthand the struggles of families whose sons and daughters are amputees from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, some of whom have been denied wheelchairs because of sloppy paperwork.

“It’s a culture in some respects that just looks at a patient as just a generic number coming through the system,” he said. “And that's not the way it should be.”

Wilkie said amputees and other severely wounded combat vets “need to be at the front of the line.”

Asked to pledge to get rid of a widely criticized process forcing amputees to make repeated trips to the VA to prove they’re still an amputee, Wilkie replied, “Absolutely.”

Wilkie also sought to clear the air on Democratic senators’ suggestions that the administration is eyeing a privatization of the whole system.

At his confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill weeks after Trump signed the $55 billion bill to fix Veterans Choice, Wilkie faced a hostile reception from Democratic senators demanding to know if he planned to do just that, something Wilkie’s predecessor said was the reason for his firing—not moving to privatize fast enough.

In the interview with Fox News, Wilkie noted such a move would need support from Capitol Hill and said the agency’s growing budget does not reflect a move to privatize.

Pressed on whether Trump has set that as a goal, Wilkie said, “No. The president wants to deliver the best care possible.”

Wilkie also downplayed a Washington Post report that he is planning to sideline Trump loyalists who have purged longtime VA staff since his predecessor was fired.

“No. In fact, I haven't removed anybody,” Wilkie replied, but wouldn’t rule out doing so in the future. ""As part of any new leadership organization, you come in with a team. You come in to assess. You come in to rearrange.""

Firing those who have given the VA a bad name has proved a challenge.

Last year, a disgraced former director of the Washington, D.C., VA had to be rehired just one month after being fired – even though, under his watch, it was found that inventories were so mismanaged that doctors had to run out mid-procedure and borrow from neighboring hospitals while patients were under anesthesia.

“The laws now give you the authority to override most of what I would consider to be the normal bureaucratic protections for those in those situations,” Wilkie said.

Another problem is the loss of talent at the VA. More than 20,000 civil servants have left since the start of the Trump administration. Some top jobs remain vacant after 15 months, and the department is short 33,000 doctors and nurses.

“We’re going to go crazy trying to fill all 33,000,”he said.

Wilkie served as undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness under Defense Secretary Jim Mattis before being tapped by Trump to lead the VA, after the president ousted Dr. David Shulkin in late March.

Asked if he was worried he might suffer the same fate as his predecessor, fired by tweet, Wilkie replied, “No, the last thing I will pay attention to is any of the usual Washington back and forth. This president has been magnificent to me.”

Wilkie also served in the Pentagon under Donald Rumsfeld, worked for Condoleezza Rice and had years of experience on Capitol Hill working for Sens. Thom Tillis and Trent Lott.

In his new office, Wilkie now hangs a portrait of Gen. Omar Bradley, the first secretary of Veterans Affairs after World War II, and has chosen Bradley's desk as his own.

""Bradley was tasked with changing VA to accommodate 11 million soldiers coming off active duty and into VA ranks,” he said. “He was really a visionary.”

Fast-forward to modern times, and the VA is still grappling with similar challenges, absorbing the soldiers who have come home from two wars stretching back nearly two decades.

Wilkie ended the interview with a message to those veterans: “Something that people need to know: We don't turn veterans down. A private facility might; we don't.”",politics

"History may not repeat itself. But it sure does rhyme.

The war in Iraq wasn’t going well in the fall of 2005 and early 2006. A federal grand jury indicted top White House aide Scooter Libby. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, faced an indictment and was forced to step aside from his leadership post. DeLay aides Tony Rudy and Michael Scanlon encountered criminal charges in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. So did Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio. Ney went to jail. Rep. Duke Cunningham, R-Calif., resigned and did time after pleading guilty to bribery and fraud charges.

But none of that quite sealed the deal for the rival party in the midterms.

Then, word surfaced on the final two days of September 2006, that Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., sent inappropriate text messages to male, teenage House pages. The Foley news erupted in the final hours of Congress trying to wrap up work in Washington and head home to campaign for the midterm elections.

Voters awarded Democrats both the House and Senate that November.

It’s unclear that if in November, we’ll will look back at Aug. 21 the same way we viewed the final days of September, some 12 years ago. But the potential is there.

In the span of three hours, a federal jury convicted former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to another set of charges. Then the feds indicted Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., R-Calif., and his wife Margaret Hunter on charges of using campaign funds for personal expenses.

After the Manafort and Cohen stories, one could almost frame the Hunter story in the category, “And in other news ...”

The charges against Hunter have nothing to do with what went down involving Manafort and Cohen. But it’s noteworthy that Hunter was one of President Trump’s earliest and most-enthusiastic supporters in 2015 and early 2016. This is back when there were only a few Republicans on Capitol Hill getting behind the president. Hunter was among them.

This wouldn’t be so interesting if it wasn’t for the fact that authorities also just arrested Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., on insider trading charges two weeks ago. Like Hunter, Collins was was one of the president’s other original congressional supporters. The Collins charges aren’t related in any way to Hunter and are in no way linked to anything with Manafort and Cohen.

But, as they did in 2006, people may just look at the chaos and pull the lever the other way.

Collins isn’t seeking re-election. That seat could now be in play because Republicans can’t pry him off the ballot.

Hunter’s attorney Gregory Vega wrote a letter to a favorite GOP whipping boy, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Vega argued that the Justice Department was “rushing to indict Congressman Hunter.” Vega asserted the indictment was “politically motivated” because of Hunter’s early endorsement of President Trump. As a result, Vega contends the indictment means “a solidly Republican district is being handed to a Democratic candidate.”

Hunter’s counsel wasn’t the only one talking Tuesday. So was Cohen’s attorney, Lanny Davis.

“Today he stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election,” said Davis of Cohen. “If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn't they be a crime for Donald Trump?”

Now, let’s step back for a moment.

Storms have churned around Trump for a long time. In 2016, Democrats and pundits thought there was no way he could win. He was course. There was the ""Access Hollywood"" tape. You name it. And yet Trump sits in the White House.

In other words, all of the customary issues that could imperil a lot of politicians don’t seem to affect Trump. His approval ratings have even been on the rise of late. There’s chatter about a Democratic “wave” this fall. But no one is really sure.

If we adopt the 2006 model, Republicans are probably toast. Democrats would claim the House -- by a lot -- and maybe even win the Senate. When Democrats earned control of the Senate in 2006, they did so by picking up six seats, marshaling a 51-49 edge. If Democrats have any chance of controlling the Senate this fall, they’ll do it by a seat or two at best.

But, history doesn’t necessarily repeat itself. So, be careful when suggesting that the events of Aug. 21 offer keen insight on the midterm elections.

Yes. Democrats may do great and pick up a bunch of House seats in Pennsylvania and California come November. But there are too many uncertainties about seats in play in Virginia, Texas, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Nevada and Minnesota.

A day like Aug. 21 may yield some clues to the midterms. But not everything.

Lots can still happen.

Somewhere, brewing out there, is an “October Surprise.” Some morsel of information which could tip the midterms one way or the other.

Consider the possibilities:

It’s hurricane season. The devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 contributed to the Republican downfall in 2006.

School is back in session or will be soon. The left organized after last winter’s shooting in Parkland, Fla. Another mass shooting just before midterms could influence voters in November.

The international stage is far from settled. Big issues percolate with Russia, Turkey, Iran, North Korea and Syria. No one can ever rule out an international crisis.

And you just never know what Trump may say or do.

“He'd better not talk about pardons for Michael Cohen or Paul Manafort tonight or any time in the future,” warned Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as the president headed to a campaign rally in West Virginia.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., argued that the “backlash” of pardon talk for Manafort or Cohen “would have Watergate written all over it.”

Still, this isn’t 2006. Or 1974, for that matter. The convergence of things that doomed the Republicans in 2006 may be immaterial this year.

But it sure does rhyme.

"Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team was one holdout juror away from winning a conviction against Paul Manafort on all 18 counts of bank and tax fraud, juror Paula Duncan told Fox News in an exclusive interview Wednesday.

“It was one person who kept the verdict from being guilty on all 18 counts,” Duncan, 52, said. She added that Mueller’s team of prosecutors often seemed bored, apparently catnapping during parts of the trial.

The identities of the jurors have been closely held, kept under seal by Judge T.S. Ellis III at Tuesday's conclusion of the high-profile trial.

But Duncan gave a behind-the-scenes account to Fox News on Wednesday, after the jury returned a guilty verdict against the former Trump campaign chairman on eight financial crime counts and deadlocked on 10 others.

Duncan described herself as an avid supporter of President Trump, but said she was moved by four full boxes of exhibits provided by Mueller’s team – though she was skeptical about prosecutors' motives in the financial crimes case.

“Certainly Mr. Manafort got caught breaking the law, but he wouldn’t have gotten caught if they weren’t after President Trump,” Duncan said of the special counsel’s case, which she separately described as a “witch hunt to try to find Russian collusion,” borrowing a phrase Trump has used in tweets more than 100 times.

“Something that went through my mind is, this should have been a tax audit,” Duncan said, sympathizing with the foundation of the Manafort defense team’s argument.

She described a tense and emotional four days of deliberations, which ultimately left one juror holding out. Behind closed doors, tempers flared at times, even though jurors never explicitly discussed Manafort’s close ties to Trump.

“It was a very emotionally charged jury room – there were some tears,” Duncan said about deliberations with a group of Virginians she didn’t feel included many “fellow Republicans.”

A political allegiance to the president also raised conflicted feelings in Duncan, but she said it ultimately didn’t change her decision about the former Trump campaign chairman.

“Finding Mr. Manafort guilty was hard for me. I wanted him to be innocent, I really wanted him to be innocent, but he wasn’t,” Duncan said. “That’s the part of a juror, you have to have due diligence and deliberate and look at the evidence and come up with an informed and intelligent decision, which I did.”

Duncan, a Missouri native and mother of two, showed Fox News her two notebooks with her juror number #0302 on the covers.

In the interview, Duncan also described how the special counsel’s prosecutors apparently had a hard time keeping their eyes open.

“A lot of times they looked bored, and other times they catnapped – at least two of them did,” Duncan said. “They seemed very relaxed, feet up on the table bars and they showed a little bit of almost disinterest to me, at times.”

The jury box was situated in a corner of the courtroom that gave them an unobstructed head-on view of the prosecutors and defense, while members of the media and the public viewed both parties from behind.

COULD MANAFORT COOPERATE WITH MUELLER'S TEAM? A LOOK AT HIS OPTIONS AFTER THE GUILTY VERDICT

Judge Ellis told jurors, including Duncan, that their names would remain sealed after the trial’s conclusion, because of dangerous threats he received during the proceedings.

But the verdict gave Duncan a license to share her story without fear.

“Had the verdict gone any other way, I might have been,” Duncan said.

MANAFORT CONVICTED ON BANK AND TAX FRAUD CHARGES

Her account of the deliberations is no longer a secret. And neither is the pro-Trump apparel she kept for a long drive to the federal courthouse in Alexandria every day.

“Every day when I drove, I had my Make America Great Again hat in the backseat,” said Duncan, who said she plans to vote for Trump again in 2020. “Just as a reminder.”

"A California Democrat who resigned last year amid sexual misconduct allegations -- including that he allegedly masturbated in front of a female lobbyist -- has transferred more than $1 million into a lieutenant governor committee account, according to a campaign finance report filed Tuesday.

The filing suggests that former state Assemblyman Matt Dababneh, 37, a Democrat who represented Woodland Hills, could be plotting a political comeback, the Sacramento Bee reported.

Dababneh stepped down last December after being accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. He denied the allegation and said at the time that he wanted to focus on clearing his name, the paper reported.

Lobbyist Pamela Lopez has accused Dababneh of pushing her into a hotel restroom in Las Vegas and masturbating in front of her, the report said.

Another woman, Jessica Yas Barker, said in December that she quit her job at a congressman's office because of Dababneh's frequent comments about her appearance, including advice that she not dress like ""such a lesbian,"" the Bee reported.

Dababneh resigned with nearly $1.2 million in the bank for his reelection effort, and put $1.06 million into his lieutenant governor campaign account by the end of March, the Bee reported.

A “Matt Dababneh for Lieutenant Governor 2022” committee was filed in March with the California secretary of state, helping to keep his campaign cash available, the Los Angeles Times reported in April.

Lopez has said Dababneh should instead donate the money to trauma and rape crisis centers to “atone for his actions,” according to the paper.

Dababneh reported spending more than $31,000 for lawyers; $11,828 for credit card payments; $8,430 for candidate travel; and $10,000 for a donation to the Hope of the Valley Rescue Mission, among other expenses, the Bee reported.

"Crown jewels belonging to the Swedish royal family were stolen in a daring heist by thieves who escaped on a motorboat today, reports claim.

Two crowns worn by Karl IX and Queen Kristina, as well as a royal orb, were taken from the 13th Century Strangnas Cathedral.

The artifacts are gold-plated and adorned in precious stones and pearls though their exact value is unknown.

Police spokesperson Thomas Agnevik said: ""It's too difficult to translate these things into some kind of value... It's such a unique object.""

He said the thieves would have had to break the glass the jewels are kept behind, which would have set off the church alarm.

Witnesses told Aftonbladet how they were enjoying lunch on a fine day when they saw men running from the cathedral in all directions.

Tourist Tom Roswell said he saw the gang jump into a little white boat and race off into Lake Malaren, one of the largest in the country.

Agnevik added: ""We are looking for a small and open motorboat. We have some different information about how exactly the boat looked. We are now examining all the tips we receive.""

"Politicians in France reportedly voted Monday in favor of a new law that would largely prohibit students from using smart devices on campus.

Students as old as 15 years old will not be allowed to use their smartphones, tablets and other similar items at school, unless they’re needed for lessons or after school activities AFP reported. Students with disabilities are not included in the ban.

Secondary schools are reportedly given the choice to opt-in on the full ban or enforce a less strict version.

Critics of the legislation, who refrained from casting votes, decried it as being a “publicity stunt,” the outlet reported. Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, on the other hand, reportedly argued that it modernized the country and brought them “into the 21st century.”

An Aeromexico jetliner taking off in a blustery storm smashed down into a nearby field but skidded to a stop virtually intact, and all 103 people aboard were able to escape advancing flames before fire engulfed the aircraft.

Passengers expressed gratitude to be alive, but many were extremely shaken after the crash Tuesday afternoon.

""It was really, really ugly,"" said Lorenzo Nunez, a passenger from Chicago who fled the plane with his two sons and wife. ""It burned in a question of seconds,"" he told reporters, snapping his fingers for emphasis.

Survivors said the Embraer 190 plane burst into flames right after it hit the ground.

""We felt the flames coming quickly ... there was a lot of smoke,"" Jaquelin Flores told the newspaper El Sol.

Romulo Campuzano, head of a political party in Durango state who was on the plane, told Foro TV that both wings were on fire as he bolted from the aircraft.

Durango state Gov. Jose Aispuro said a gust of wind hit flight AM2431 heading from the city of Durango to Mexico City just as it was lifting off the tarmac, forcing the pilot to abort takeoff.

Passengers said they heard a loud noise as the plane's left wing banged to the ground, and both engines tore loose. The plane stayed upright, though, and the escape slides activated.

Aispuro said it was too soon to speculate on the cause of the crash. Mechanical failure and human error could be factors, but certainly the weather wasn't favorable. Strong wind and heavy rain with marble-sized hail lashed Durango city, even damaging hangars at the airport.

""The most important thing in the seriousness that is an accident of this nature is that there were no deaths — that's what is most encouraging for us,"" Aispuro said at a news conference.

After the accident, several passengers walked away from the plane before first responders arrived. Some sought medical help, while others rushed home to loved ones. Officials spent much of the afternoon tracking down survivors to ensure that everyone was accounted for.

Officials said 49 people had been hospitalized — most with minor injuries. The pilot suffered the most serious injury, a cervical lesion that required surgery. Some people had burns on a quarter of their bodies, said Durango state Health Ministry spokesman Fernando Ros.

Aispuro said all were expected to live.

Aeromexico Chief Executive Officer Andres Conesa described the day as ""very difficult"" and credited the timely reaction of crew and passengers for the lack of fatalities.

""Our heart is with those affected and their families,"" he said at an evening news conference.

Conesa said the passengers included 88 adults, nine children and two babies and the crew consisted of two flight attendants and two pilots.

He said the jetliner had been sent for maintenance in February and the crew was well-rested, having started their work day in Durango.

The web site Planespotters.net said the Brazilian-made medium-range jet was about 10 years old and had seen service with two other airlines before joining the Aeromexico fleet.

Operations were suspended at Durango city's Guadalupe Victoria airport after the crash.",world

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Wednesday rejected accusations that Australia supported corruption and crime under Malaysia's former leader by harboring a high-profile fugitive since 2015.

Malaysian prime minister-in waiting Anwar Ibrahim recently said in an interview with Australia's ABC radio that some of Canberra's foreign policies ""clearly have been tainted"" and viewed as ""complicit to the tolerance of crimes, of corruption and also criminal action"" by shielding wrongdoers like former policeman Sirul Azhar Umar.

Sirul, who was a former bodyguard of ex-Prime Minister Najib Razak, fled to Australia after he was sentenced to death over the 2006 murder of Mongolian model Altantuya Shaariibuu. Her body was found blown up with explosives in a jungle after her yearlong affair with a friend of Najib ended.

Bishop said Sirul remained under immigration detention and that Malaysia has not made any extradition request.

""In the past, Australia has worked with the government of Malaysia of the day. For the past 61 years, it's been the same government. If we were waiting for the new government, we would have been waiting for 61 years before dealing with Malaysia and that's patently ridiculous,"" she told a news conference after meeting Anwar's wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who is now Malaysia's deputy prime minister.

Sirul's case has posed a dilemma for Australia's government, which cannot by law extradite someone who could face capital punishment.

His case cropped up again after the shocking defeat of Najib's coalition in May 9 elections that ushered in Malaysia's first transition of power since independence from Britain in 1957. Najib last month pleaded not guilty to charges of criminal breach of trust and abuse of power in a case linked to a massive corruption scandal in the 1MDB state fund that he set up but which accumulated billions in debts.

Malaysian police recently said they will reopen investigations into Shaariibuu's gruesome murder after her father lodged a fresh complaint with the new government.

Bishop said she didn't discuss Sirul's case specifically with Wan Azizah but they talked about Malaysia's plan in general to abolish the death penalty. Asked if Canberra will deport Sirul if Malaysia makes a request, she said she refused to ""speculate"" as there was no such application.

Bilateral relations were chilled for years after Canberra condemned Malaysia's ""barbaric"" execution of two Australian heroin traffickers in 1986.

Sirul and another former policeman were initially convicted in 2009 of Shaariibuu's murder but both won an appeal in 2013. The Supreme Court in 2015 upheld the initial High Court ruling. The prosecution contended that the murder of Shaariibuu was ordered by her former lover, Abdul Razak Baginda, a prominent defense analyst, after their affair ended.

The High Court in 2008 acquitted Abdul Razak, a married man and a former Najib confidante, of charges of abetting the murder.",world

The fancy car, the luxury address, the gun.

How and why a security aide to French President Emmanuel Macron obtained them are at the heart of a political scandal dragging in the leader who promised voters an exemplary government before his election less than 15 months ago.

France has been consumed by a political firestorm in the two weeks since Le Monde newspaper revealed that a man often at the president's side beat up a protester while observing May Day demonstrations with police.

The violence, captured on video, led to questions about Alexandre Benalla's role at the presidential Elysee Palace. It also fed Macron's critics, who contend that the former investment banker runs the country like a private business with a small band of underlings.

Shock turned to anger once the public learned that government officials knew about the beating the day after it happened and only suspended Benalla for two weeks instead of firing him and reporting him to judicial authorities.

The punishment was widely perceived as so inadequate that it raised troubling questions: Was there a cover-up? Does France have a parallel police system or a deep state running the country from the shadows?

Macron has dismissed the growing scandal as a ""tempest in a teapot."" Yet the public outrage is having an impact. A staff reorganization at the Elysee presidential palace is expected in the fall. Public opinion polls suggest the crisis already has cost the French leader popularity points.

The government survived two no-confidence votes Tuesday in the lower house of parliament, where Macron's centrist party has control. But the virulent debate that accompanied the votes made it clear France's political opposition isn't about to let the drama die.

Authorities have moved swiftly to catch up with the firestorm. Benalla lost his job two days after Le Monde identified him. Days later, an investigating judge handed him preliminary charges, along with three ranking police officers and an employee of Macron's party who accompanied Benalla to the May 1 protest.

Usually invisible officials who run France have squirmed under TV lights.

The leaders of the national police, a general, the administrators who run the Elysee Palace and the interior minister were among those called before two parliamentary commissions to explain Benalla's initial light punishment, and why the 26-year-old had a gun permit and perks like an Elysee car, which is typically reserved for top police brass.

Macron, 40, did not say a word about the beating until six days after the video of it went viral, when he pushed back.

""Alexandre Benalla never held the nuclear codes. Alexandre Benalla never lived in a 300-square-meter apartment....Alexandre Benalla was never my lover,"" the president said, addressing news reports and rumors about the allegedly favorable treatment given his aide.

Macron said he viewed Benalla's violence as a betrayal, but voiced appreciation for the work and loyalty of a young man from a disadvantaged neighborhood in Normandy who the president said he wouldn't forget ""whatever happens.""

Despite the disclosures, an enigma hangs over the aide who signed onto Macron's security detail during his presidential campaign and rose quickly to his inner circle.

Benalla was given the vague title of ""charge de mission"" that kept him off the official books. He often was seen at Macron's side on official outings. However, the unclear nature of his duties has helped fuel speculation about secret police. The presidential palace has a complex security unit of military gendarmes and police.

Benalla has said his job was to organize presidential visits.

""There is no parallel police,"" the secretary-general of Elysee Palace, Alexis Kohler, insisted before the Senate inquiry commission.

Long before the scandal broke, Macron, who created a political party from scratch, was accused by detractors of mounting an imperial presidency and living atop a citadel, cut off from French citizens with whom he had vowed to connect.

Two recent polls suggest the Benalla affair hasn't helped. An Ipsos firm poll, taken shortly after the scandal broke, showed the president with a 32 percent popularity rating — four points lower than the previous month. A poll by the Ifop firm also measured a four-point drop in Macron's popularity a week into the crisis.

Some feel the affair has had too much impact.

""We shouldn't paralyze the country,"" said art gallery owner Franck Le Feuvre, who is among those who think the scandal is a waste of time. Benalla ""is just a guy who was too zealous, and no one dared intervene so as not to offend the big boss.""

Benalla has said that he regretted his actions became ""the source of multiple fantasies.""

Government officials testified before parliamentary inquiry commissions that Benalla was accorded an Elysee-owned apartment along the Seine while serving his suspension and also continued to receive his salary, which was to be deducted from his vacation time.

They also revealed that while working at the presidential palace, Benalla received a permit for a Glock pistol on his fourth try. The permit was approved after a new request, on new grounds, was transmitted to police by Macron's office director, Patrick Strzoda.

The sleek car with a police light used by the security aide was needed for presidential motorcades, Strzoda explained.

The commander on the ground at the May protest where Benalla was seen acting violently testified that he thought Benalla, who as an observer was illegally equipped with a police arm band and radio, was an officer in civilian clothes.",world

Decades after the end of the Korean War in 1953, the remains of dozens of presumed U.S. war dead began their journey home following a repatriation ceremony in South Korea on Wednesday.

North Korea handed over the remains in 55 boxes last week and allowed a U.S. military transport plane to move them to the U.S. Osan Air Base near Seoul in South Korea. While it was an apparent goodwill gesture by North Korea toward the United States, the return comes amid growing skepticism about whether the North will follow through on its pledge of nuclear disarmament.

Hundreds of U.S. and South Korean troops gathered at a hanger at the Osan base for the repatriation ceremony, which included a rifle salute and the playing of the U.S. and South Korean national anthems and dirges in front of the U.N. flag-covered metal cases containing the remains.

After the ceremony, the remains were moved one by one to transport planes which will fly them to Hawaii, where they will undergo an in-depth forensic analysis, in some cases using mitochondrial DNA profiles, at a Defense Department laboratory to establish identifications. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week that the return of the 55 boxes was a positive step but not a guarantee that the bones are American.

Vice President Mike Pence, the son of a Korean War veteran, is to fly to Hawaii for what the military calls an ""honorable carry ceremony"" marking the arrival of remains to American soil.

The repatriation is a breakthrough in a long-stalled U.S. effort to obtain war remains from North Korea. About 7,700 U.S. soldiers are listed as missing from the 1950-53 Korean War, and 5,300 of the remains are believed to still be in North Korea.

""The remains received from North Korea are being handled with the utmost care and respect by professional historians, forensic scientists, uniformed personnel and government officials,"" the U.S.-led U.N. Command said in a statement. It said it ""never leaves troops behind, living or deceased, and will continue the mission of repatriation until every service member returns home.""",world

Russian journalists who were killed in the Central African Republic had been working on an investigation into Russian private military contractors working abroad, their colleagues said Wednesday.

The reporters were killed in an ambush earlier in the week outside the town of Sibut in the CAR, according to local and Russian officials. CAR officials have only said that the reporters were found dead after being kidnapped by about 10 men wearing turbans and speaking only Arabic, but have yet to give further details.

Exiled Russian opposition figure Mikhail Khodorkovsky said on Facebook Wednesday that the journalists were collaborating with his investigative project on a story entitled ""Russian mercenaries.""

Andrei Konyakhin, the chief editor of Khodorkovsky's Investigations Management Center, said the reporters were trying to shed light on a private Russian security company operating in CAR, and on Russia's interests there. Russian and foreign media have mentioned the firm's name in reports as Wagner, a military contractor group that is linked to a businessman associated with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Konyakhin said the men, Kirill Radchenko, Alexander Rastorguyev and Orkhan Dzhemal, were traveling to the north of the country to talk to a United Nations representative there. The journalists were carrying several thousand US dollars in cash to fund their stay in CAR, as well as valuable cameras and gear.

Konyakhin told the Associated Press in a phone interview that the main working scenario at the moment was that the killings were the result of a robbery, but he is skeptical and thinks the attack could be linked to their investigation.

""This was done in a very demonstrative fashion,"" he said, wondering why the attackers didn't bother to cover up their tracks, hide the car and why they left the driver alive. ""If they could have just taken everything from them, why kill them?""

Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon and once Russia's richest man, lives in London after spending 10 years in a Russian prison in a case widely seen as politicly motivated. From exile, Khodorkovsky supports a number of civil society groups and media projects in Russia, where authorities continue to investigate him on a variety of charges.",world

Southeast Asian nations are expected to welcome an initial negotiating draft of a nonaggression pact with China on the South China Sea, but critics warn that the protracted talks provide a diplomatic cover for Beijing's tenacious aggression in the disputed waters.

Top diplomats of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will also praise the rapprochement between the Koreas, along with that of President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, when they gather for four days of annual summitry in Singapore starting Wednesday.

Currently led by Singapore, the 10-nation bloc will host on Saturday Asia's largest security forum, including the key players involved in the Korean Peninsula's disarmament efforts, which will provide a chance for them to talk on the summit's sidelines.

Concern over rising extremism in the region and the plight of minority Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar's Rakhine state will also be under the spotlight. Myanmar is to brief the ASEAN foreign ministers on the situation in Rakhine during a lunch ""retreat,"" an informal gathering where ministers raise contentious issues that normally are a taboo in their staid plenary meetings.

Founded in 1967 in the Cold War era as a bulwark against communism, ASEAN has a bedrock principle of non-interference in each other's domestic affairs and decides by consensus, meaning even one member state can doom any proposal it deems offensive.

Those cardinal principles have drastically slowed decision-making and have been used by authoritarian leaders to dodge outside criticism, causing the diplomatic collective to be labeled by skeptics as a ""club of dictators"" and human rights violators. But its principles have allowed ASEAN to maintain diverse national identities, from rambunctious democracies to martial law regimes, for half a century.

The bloc has also been an acceptable broker for talks for all sorts of conflicts.

In the South China Sea disputes, which have pitted China, Taiwan and four ASEAN member states — Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam — the group is expected to announce an agreement with Beijing on an initial negotiating draft of a so-called ""code of conduct,"" a proposed set of regional norms and rules aimed at preventing the long-seething disputes from degenerating into a shooting war.

Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said Tuesday before flying to Singapore that talks on the code could be concluded this year or next. Other Asian diplomats have not been as optimistic.

The ministers will welcome ""the improving cooperation between ASEAN and China and were encouraged by the progress of the substantive negotiations towards the early conclusion of an effective code of conduct in the South China Sea on a mutually agreed timeline,"" according to a draft of a joint post-summit communique by the ministers which was obtained by The Associated Press.

Some of the ministers would repeat their concerns over China's transformation of seven disputed reefs into islands, including three with runways, which now resemble small cities armed with weapons, including surface-to-air missiles. China has come under intense criticisms for the aggressive action but it has said it has the right to build on its territory and defend them at all costs.

The ministers ""took note of the concerns expressed by some countries on the land reclamations in the area, which have eroded trust and confidence, increased tensions and may undermine peace, security and stability in the region,"" the draft communique said without naming China and reflecting the internal divisions over the touchy issue.

ASEAN member states Cambodia and Laos, which are known China allies, have opposed the use of strong language against Beijing over the disputes.

Greg Poling, director of the U.S.-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, which monitors developments in the South China Sea, said highlighting the draft code of conduct in the summit will be ""more political theater than substance at this point"" given the lack of agreement on areas it will cover and whether the pact should be legally binding after more than 15 years of talks.

Without any major concessions, especially from China, Poling said the talks would drag further while China presses actions to reinforce its vast territorial claims ""without paying much price because the code of conduct process offers diplomatic cover to claim it is seeking a peaceful and fair settlement.""

Zimbabwe's ruling party has won a majority of seats in Parliament, the electoral commission announced Wednesday, as the country braced for the first official results of the presidential election.

The ruling ZANU-PF won 109 seats while the main opposition MDC party had 41 in the country's 210-seat House of Assembly. The commission said 58 seats had yet to be declared.

The commission says it will announce the results of Zimbabwe's presidential race, pitting President Emmerson Mnangagwa against opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, only after all the votes have come in from across the country.

Western and other election observers were poised Wednesday morning to give their first public assessments of the election and whether it was free and fair.

The opposition alleges the elections have irregularities, saying voting results were not posted outside one-fifth of polling stations as required by law.

Mnangagwa's government, meanwhile, accused Chamisa and his supporters of inciting ""violence"" by already declaring he had won Monday's election, the first after former leader Robert Mugabe stepped down in November under military pressure.

""Let me also warn such individuals and groups that no one is above the law,"" Home Affairs Minister Obert Mpofu said. Security forces ""will remain on high alert and continue to monitor the security situation in the country.""

Zimbabweans desperately hope Monday's peaceful vote will lift them out of economic and political stagnation after decades of Mugabe's rule, but the country is haunted by a history of electoral violence and manipulation that means trust is scarce, despite today's freer environment.

While the electoral commission has five days from the end of voting to release the final tally, the national mood is growing anxious partly because unofficial results are already swirling on social media.

Dozens of opposition supporters gathered Tuesday evening at their headquarters in the capital, Harare, celebrating in the belief that they had won the presidential election based on results they said they collected from agents in the field.

As they danced to music blasting from speakers set up on a truck, police with water cannon circulated in the area.

"Cameras that may not work, 11-year-old cars and hundreds of rolls of toilet paper -- just some of the items you can bid on during the U.S. Embassy in London's moving sale.

The 100 packs of 12 rolls each of mini jumbo toilet paper are being offered in ""new and unused"" condition in the online auction, which also includes a used Volvo and two cameras -- which may be broken.

None of the items have any official US insignias or historical value and appear to be part of the embassy’s “spring cleaning” after its relocation earlier this year to a new $1 billion facility in Vauxhall.

An embassy spokesperson told The Independent the auction was an annual event that allows State Department employees to get money back for items that are “no longer needed, or have been damaged, or refreshed.”

The sale of the toilet paper, the spokesperson said, was because the dispensers at the new embassy are different dimensions and the old rolls don’t fit.

The spokesperson described them as “probably a bit above bog standard.”

They are being sold as a set, with 30 bids already made on them.

Probably the most expensive item on the auction list is a nearly 11-year-old black Volvo S80, which was described as in “usable” condition. So far there have been 34 bids for the car.

Other items include five Dyson vacuum cleaners, 22 plastic stacking chairs with wheels, a ceramic lamp without a shade, a Bosch circular saw and a barcode scanner set.

The two cameras – an old Sony Mavica and a Nikon 105VR – are being offered “sold as seen” with “working condition unknown.”

The auction runs until August 8.

It appears the embassy in London is not the only one with an online auction. The embassies in Ankara, Turkey; Yerevan, Armenia; Adana, Turkey; and Kyiv, Ukraine are holding their own sales while locations in Stockholm, Sweden; Lisbon, Portugal; and Belgrade, Serbia are preparing other auctions.

Everything from old furniture and domestic appliances to computers and cellphones are up for grabs.",world
"Zimbabwe's president said Thursday his government has been in touch with the main opposition leader in an attempt to ease tensions after deadly election-related violence, a day after he accused the opposition of inciting it.

Soldiers cleared people from the streets of downtown Harare after they swept in and used gunfire on Wednesday to disperse protesters angry over alleged vote-rigging in Monday's peaceful election, the first without longtime leader Robert Mugabe on the ballot.

The Commonwealth joined other election observers in urging Zimbabwe to release results of the presidential vote as soon as possible to reduce the tensions, saying delays will increase speculation that results were manipulated. The electoral commission said the results would come ""very soon.""

By law the commission has five days from the vote to release them, but both observers and the opposition have asked why presidential results were counted first but are being released last.

In a series of posts on Twitter, President Emmerson Mnangagwa said ""we have been in communication"" with challenger Nelson Chamisa and that ""we must maintain this dialogue in order to protect the peace we hold dear.""

The conciliatory remarks came a day after soldiers shot live rounds and beat demonstrators, many of whom threw rocks and set fires to protest alleged election fraud. The government has said three people were killed.

The violence erupted after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission said the ruling ZANU-PF party won a majority in parliament. The commission has said the vote was free and fair.

A credible vote is crucial to the lifting of international sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe so that its collapsed economy can recover. Elections under Mugabe's 37-year rule were marked by violence against the opposition and alleged fraud.

Mnangagwa called for an ""independent investigation"" into the violence in Harare, saying those responsible ""should be identified and brought to justice.""

Human rights activists and some international observers, meanwhile, criticized the military for opening fire on unarmed civilians in what they said was a disproportionate reaction to the protests and rioting.

Soldiers fired ""randomly"" and beat up bystanders who were not involved in the protests, said the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum.

""Yesterday's events leave ordinary citizens with serious doubts that this government is any different from its predecessor, if not worse,"" the forum said, referring to the long rule of Mugabe, who resigned in November under military pressure.

The head of the Commonwealth election observers in Zimbabwe, former Ghana leader John Dramani Mahama, condemned what he called the ""excessive use of force"" against protesters and said all sides should act with restraint.

Britain's minister for Africa, Harriett Baldwin, said she was ""deeply concerned"" about the deadly violence and urged political leaders to ensure calm and restraint ""at this critical moment.""

The U.S. Embassy appealed to Americans to avoid Harare's central business district and said ""the political situation in Zimbabwe remains uncertain.""

There was a heavy police presence around the headquarters of Chamisa's opposition Movement for Democratic Change party.

The military deployment was the first time that soldiers had appeared in the streets of the capital since Mugabe's departure in November. At that time, thousands of jubilant residents welcomed the soldiers as liberators.

Now some Harare residents, standing amid the shattered windows of Wednesday's violence, expressed frustration and exhaustion.

""We are tired of these people. They have to go, they have to go, the ZANU-PF regime,"" said a 23-year-old who gave his name only as Elliott. ""Because 29 years of oppressing the people of Zimbabwe, we are tired, we are saying we are tired.""

Another resident, 29-year-old Sifas Gavanga, said: ""We are a peaceful nation. We don't deserve the death we saw that happened yesterday.""

Zimbabwean authorities now say the military will remain in the capital until ""this situation is over.""",world

The youngest student ever admitted to Mexico's National Autonomous University wouldn't call himself a ""genius.""

Carlos Santamaria Diaz, a 12-year-old who will begin classes for an undergraduate degree in biomedical physics Monday, was dwarfed by the upholstered blue chair he sat in to answer reporters' questions Friday.

With his feet barely brushing the floor, he laughed out loud and shook his head when a reporter asked if he considered himself a genius.

""I don't like to use that word,"" he said.

Carlos passed the university's entrance exam and has already done preparatory work at the university's school of chemistry in its genetics sciences center.

The boy from western Guadalajara grew bored with public school at an early age and turned to the web where he taught himself calculus and physics. By the age of nine, he participated in university programs in analytical chemistry, biochemistry and biology.

Nervously running his hands through his hair and speaking passionately of finding cures for rare diseases, his behavior seemed typical of a confident albeit young college student until the university's photographer asked him to pose with a stuffed mascot and the boy emerged.

When asked if he ever felt isolated because of his intelligence, Carlos shrugged off the question: ""The truth is, no, I feel like the university has been very good to me, especially the chemistry faculty.""

His mother Arcelia Diaz said that like any mom she was proud of her son.

Carlos offered advice to Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: ""First off, I would tell him not to make the same mistakes as the previous presidents.""

Politicians should ""take care of the country like they take care of themselves,"" he said. ""This a country filled with people who have dreams and at the same don't have any dreams because they don't have any opportunities.""

The university said Carlos would be treated like any other student, with no special privileges or benefits.",world

Eight places in the center, south and east of Portugal have broken their local temperature records amid a wave of heat that is predicted to rise still further, the country's weather agency says.

The highest temperature recorded Thursday was 45.2 degrees Celsius (113.4 Fahrenheit) near Abrantes, a town 150 kilometers (93 miles) northeast of the capital, Lisbon, the IPMA said.

Temperatures in Portugal were forecast to keep building nationwide on Friday, to around 45 degrees, and to peak at 47 degrees in some places on Saturday.

Portugal's highest recorded temperature was 47.4 degrees (117.3 Fahrenheit) in 2003. Emergency services have issued a red alert, placing extra services such as medical staff and firefighters on standby through Sunday.

In Portugal's southern Alentejo province, streets were largely deserted and some farmers chose to work during the night. Beaches around Lisbon, meanwhile, were packed.

Temperatures were being driven higher across the Iberian peninsula by a hot air mass moving northward from Africa, which is also bringing dust from the Sahara Desert, meteorologists said. The dust gave the sky a dark yellow hue in some places.

In Spain, heat warnings were also issued for 41 of the country's 50 provinces as temperatures were expected to reach up to 44 degrees Celsius.

Summer temperatures close to 40 degrees Celsius are not unusual in southern parts of the Iberian peninsula.

Spain's highest recorded temperature is 46.9 degrees Celsius in Cordoba, a southern city, last July.

The World Meteorological Organization says continental Europe's record is 48 degrees Celsius in Greece in 1977.

In northern Europe, Sweden was still under threat from wildfires, which in recent weeks have extended into the Arctic Circle.

Sweden's Civil Contingencies Agency warned of ""a high risk"" for wildfires in central and southern Sweden this weekend because of the continuing dry weather and strong winds.

An unusually long, torrid summer in Britain, meanwhile, has taken its toll on the country's flowers. Supermarket chain Morrisons has begun selling ""wonky"" flowers that have not developed properly.

The U.K.'s Met Office weather service says July was the country's third-warmest in more than a century. The hot weather is continuing, with temperatures forecast to reach 30 degrees Celsius in southern Britain on Friday.

Cambodia's Supreme Court denied a bail request Wednesday for Kem Sokha, the leader of the now-dissolved main opposition party who has been detained for nearly a year without trial on a treason charge. As with his previous bail hearings, he was not taken to court for what has previously been explained as security reasons.

The ruling followed an apparent softening of the government's harsh stance toward critics. Four land rights activists were pardoned and released from prison on Monday, and two journalists who formerly worked for U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia were released Tuesday on bail as they await trial on espionage charges.

The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party was dissolved by the court last year, with no convincing evidence, for alleged complicity in a treason plot supposedly backed by the United States.

Prime Minister Hun Sen cracked down on critics and opponents last year in what was seen as an effort to ensure his party would win elections this year and give him another five years in power. He has led the country for more than three decades and has said he intends to remain at the helm for at least 10 more years.

Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party, with no credible opposition, won a clean sweep in last month's general election.

The first leader and co-founder of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, Sam Rainsy, has been in self-imposed exile since 2016 to avoid serving a prison term for a defamation conviction. Kem Sokha succeeded him and was put under severe legal pressure in several cases last year, culminating in his arrest last September.

The Supreme Court, sustaining a ruling by the Appeals Court, said Kem Sokha, 65, had to remain in custody to ensure social stability.

Kem Sokha's lawyers said he should be freed on bail because the investigation of his case is complete and he was sick and needed medical treatment. Judge Kong Srim responded that he was not particularly sick and could be treated by prison doctors if necessary.",world

What's left of Finton Lewis' thinning hair is spiked and dyed an orange-red color.

The 64-year-old Lewis says the haircut keeps him feeling younger on the outside, and playing the card game of bridge keeps his brain nimble on the inside.

""I know I'm not as physically fit as most sports people are,"" said Lewis, who is playing for India in the bridge competition at the Asian Games.

Being fit doesn't matter much in bridge, which is being included for the first time in the Asian Games. Fans like to talk it up as a ""mind game"" in the same realm as chess.

Yang Kong Te of the Philippines is playing in the Asian Games at 85. Lee Hung Fong of Malaysia is 81. Indonesian billionaire Michael Bambang Hartono is a mere 78, and the big reason why bridge is on the schedule. His reported net worth in about $17 billion, a fortune made in tobacco, banking, and communications.

To be fair, the median age of the field is about 50, which is still generations away from 9-year-old Indonesian skateboarder Aliqqa Novvery — the youngest of the more than 11,000 competitors in the Asian Games.

The Olympic Council of Asia, which governs the games, reportedly balked at including bridge, which in the eyes of some is linked with card games such as poker, black jack — and hence, gambling.

To be fair, bridge would be as out of place in a casino as bullfighting in Bhutan.

The auditoriums set up for bridge are hushed, dotted with dozens of card tables with four players at each. At one session, curious photographers were given access for just five minutes, and then ushered away. Fans can watch the hands that are dealt — and how they are played — on large television screens filled with the red and black symbols for spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs.

""The photographers really wouldn't matter because the top players zone out these distractions,"" Aaida Abu-Jaber, a player from Jordan told The Associated Press. ""They are in their zone and focused and they don't know what's happening around them. They are just looking at their cards and thinking.""

Abu-Jaber called it ""athletics of the mind, rather than the body.""

There's no age limit, and no language barrier. Abu-Jaber said she's played against dozens of nationalities — on-line and in-person. The game has a universal language everyone understands, driven by English-rooted words like ""no trump, slam, pass""and so forth.

""You can play with anybody, even if you can't understand their language and they can't understand yours,"" she said.

Though age is no problem, attracting a younger generation is.

Asadullah Khan, who is playing for Pakistan, joked that many of the players have ""no hair and protruding bellies. Most of us are smokers and losing our cognitive skills.""

For the record, 54-year-old Khan has all his hair — gray hair and a gray mustache.

""It's going to be an extinct game if the younger generation doesn't take it up,"" he said. ""The younger people are not enthusiastic about bridge, not excited about it unless it runs in the family.""

Khan said attracting younger players might be easy since bridge offers sedentary thrills, perhaps like computer games.

He argued that ""defending a (card) hand well or making a special play"" was just as exciting as serving an ace in tennis.

He even pushed for inclusion in the Olympics, which seems unlikely.

""It surely should be in the Olympics,"" Khan said. ""Getting exposure like this helps.""",world

The leader of Syria's al-Qaida affiliate has vowed to fight on in Idlib province, the country's last major rebel stronghold, in the face of a possible government offensive there.

The rare public statement by Abu Mohammed al-Golani came as Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces have been sending reinforcements into areas around Idlib in the country's northwest, along the border with Turkey.

The United States, Britain and France have expressed concern at reports of the Syrian military targeting civilians, schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure in Idlib and underlined ""concern at the potential for further — and illegal — use of chemical weapons"" to bring the province under government control.

Earlier this year, Syrian government forces captured rebel-held suburbs of the capital, Damascus, as well as the southern provinces of Daraa, Quneitra and Sweida.

In parts of these regions, rebels accepted to reconcile with the government, handing over their heavy weapons in return for amnesty — or agreed to be bussed out together with their families and other civilians to rebel-held areas in Idlib.

But taking Idlib would be a much more difficult challenge for Assad's forces as the province is also the base of al-Golani's militant and heavily armed Levant Liberation Committee as the al-Qaida branch in Syria is known.

In his comments, which came in a video released late on Tuesday, al-Golani said state-sponsored surrenders of rebel groups, similar to those that recently occurred elsewhere in Syria, won't happen in Idlib as such actions would be considered ""treason"" by his al-Qaida-linked fighters.

Earlier this month, the Syrian government dropped leaflets over Idlib, urging residents to reconcile with its authority. Officials have warned government forces would take back the province by force if necessary.

According to U.N. estimates, 2.9 million people live in Idlib and surrounding opposition-held areas. The U.N. has appealed to Turkey to open its border to refugees, should the Syrian government decide to attack the province.

Turkey, which has established itself as a sponsor of rebels in northern Syria, already hosts some 3.5 million Syrian refugees - the most of any nation. It has also established 12 monitoring posts in Idlib and deployed 1,000 troops in the province.

In the video, released on the occasion of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, al-Golani is seen wearing an olive-green military uniform and saying that ""Turkish monitoring towers"" cannot be relied on to take on Assad's forces.

""Our weapons are the source of our strength and honor,"" al-Golani says. ""Thinking about surrendering to the enemy and handing over weapons will be considered treason.""

Meanwhile, another militant figure from the al-Qaida-linked group, Abu Yaqzan al-Masri, was unharmed when a gunman opened fire at him and missed on Tuesday. The shooter was detained, according to Mazan al-Shami, an opposition activist based in northwestern Syria.

Dozens of members of the group have been killed over the past few months in attacks blamed on its main jihadi rival, the Islamic State group.",world

His coach had a heart attack and couldn't travel. He had to take three school exams in an embassy under close scrutiny of two government officials flown in to Jakarta to supervise.

And after all that, in the event where he was contending for an Asian Games medal, a teammate dived too early and Sri Lanka was disqualified from the heats in the 4x100-meter freestyle relay on Wednesday morning.

It has been a testing time indeed for Akalanka Peiris.

""This week was so, so hectic for me,"" said Peiris, who had to skip the opening ceremony last weekend because of his tight testing schedule — both academic and physical.

Still, the 18-year-old student from St. Peter's College in Colombo said he'd rather be here than anywhere else.

When the timetable clash became apparent between his exams and the Asian Games, Peiris decided it would be better to take the tests. His rationale was that even if he put them off for a year, some other sports event could crop up then. Also, he figured, he'd be a more competitive swimmer in four years at next Asian Games.

""I chose the exam,"" he said. ""After that, the Olympic committee wanted me to swim the relay because we had a bronze medal prospect.""

That's how Sri Lanka's national Olympic committee got involved. After high-level negotiations, the committee worked out a way for Peiris to become the first Sri Lankan student to take the tests while abroad.

It came at a cost — two extra airfares and accommodation for the ""invigilators"" — exam proctors — from the Sri Lankan examination department. Plus space had to be found at the Sri Lankan embassy for him to take the tests for English, general knowledge, and economics.

""The people really supported me very well,"" Peiris said. ""English and general knowledge was easy for me. The accounting paper was the difficult one, but I made it.""

The first test was Saturday and his last test was Monday, right after he'd placed fourth in his heat of the 50-meter backstroke.

Peiris said he'd had so much support from the delegation and the local organizers, and was only sorry his regular coach Manoj Abeysinghe — father of two of his relay teammates Matthew and Kyle Abeysinghe — had health problems last week.

""Manoj was going to come, but four or five days before he had a heart attack,"" Peiris said. ""We missed him a lot.""

The Sri Lankans posted a competitive time that would have earned them a spot in the final, but was rubbed out after the narrowly illegal change.

""We did a great job. We went our PBs, but unfortunately a small mistake had big repercussions,"" he said. ""We missed the opportunity to get the bronze medal.

""But it's OK. We'll work on it (and) we'll do something in the South Asian Games and next Asian Games as well.""

In the immediate future are more events — the 50-meter butterfly and the 200 backstroke — then thinking about university and more swimming either in the United States or Australia.",world

An approaching typhoon has whipped up strong winds, waves and heavy rain in southern South Korea, leaving one person missing and one injured, while another typhoon headed for western Japan on Thursday.

Typhoon Soulik is forecast to make landfall at the southwestern town of Seocheon at 3 a.m. Friday, dumping 3-6 inches (7-15 centimeters) of rain and gusts of up to 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour, meteorologists said. It is expected to weaken after crossing the Korean Peninsula's mountainous terrain.

President Moon Jae-in instructed officials to review whether to reschedule or change venues for rare reunions of Korean families separated by war. The second round of meetings is set for Friday at a North Korean mountain resort where the typhoon is expected to pass.

A 23-year-old woman was listed as missing after she was apparently swept away by waves while taking a photo on Jeju Island on Wednesday night, a disaster response agency said.

It said the waves also left a 31-year-old man injured.

More than 200 flights have been canceled in South Korea and many schools throughout the country plan to cancel classes on Friday.

Moon called for special efforts to minimize damage that's expected from the typhoon.

Another typhoon called Cimarron is expected to cross western Japan on Thursday night. Japan's weather agency has warned of strong gusts, high waves and heavy rain.

Airlines canceled over 300 flights to and from airports in the Shikoku and Kinki regions, according to Japan's Kyodo News service.

On Wednesday morning, three university students went missing along the coast of the central Japanese city of Shizuoka, Kyodo said.

South Korean officials said the second typhoon won't likely affect the Korean Peninsula.",world
"A Thai boy was beaten to death by an incensed Buddhist monk after the child displayed ""playful"" behavior during a temple prayer session, Thai police said Friday.

Monk Suphachai Suthiyano, 64, allegedly assaulted Wattanapol Sisawad, 9, with a bamboo stick and slammed the boy's head against a pillar before Sisawad fell into a coma last weekend, AFP reported. Sisawad died as a result of his injuries on Thursday.

Suthiyano reportedly flew into a rage after the young boy disrupted a Buddhist ceremony at the temple in Kanchanaburi, Thailand, two hours west of Bangkok.

Thai police originally charged Suthiyano with assault when he was arrested Sunday, but, after the boy’s death, the charge will be revised to assault resulting in death, authorities said.

Suthiyano lost his status as a monk following the arrest.

Sisawad's mother told Thai media she “will not forgive"" Suthiyano.

"A nurse for aid group Doctors Without Borders launched a terror attack on Israeli troops near the Gaza border Monday, shooting and throwing an explosive device at soldiers before being shot dead, Israeli officials said.

Hani al-Majdalawi was killed during a gun battle with Israel Defense Forces as he tried to slip past a border fence and gain entrance to Israel.

No Israeli troops were injured in the incident, The Times of Israel reported.

“He who takes part in saving lives should assist in humanitarian activities in the Gaza Strip, and should not take part in terrorism,” Maj. Gen. Kamil Abu Rokon, the head of Israel Defense Ministry body COGAT, said in a statement. COGAT coordinates government activities with Palestinians.

Al-Majdalawi’s brother, Osama, wrote on Facebook that al-Majdalawi was recently married, expecting a child and not affiliated with any militant groups. Osama also noted, however, that his brother had purchased a rifle.

Doctors Without Borders confirmed al-Majdalawi had worked for the group and was killed by Israeli troops. But the group didn’t comment on why al-Majdalawi put down his medical kit and picked up a rifle, with a spokesperson telling the Associated Press the organization was still “working to verify and understand the circumstances regarding this extremely serious incident.”

A prominent Irish survivor of priestly sexual abuse told a Vatican-sponsored conference Friday that the Holy See must put in place ""robust structures"" and strong sanctions to hold accountable bishops and Vatican officials who fail protect children from predator priests.

Marie Collins, a former member of Pope Francis' abuse advisory board, urged Catholic families attending the Dublin conference to ask why the pope scrapped such a structure — a proposed Vatican accountability tribunal — several years ago.

Collins was the headline speaker at a panel discussion on keeping children safe from pedophiles at the World Meeting of Families, a once-every-three-year Vatican-sponsored rally meant to encourage and energize Catholic families. Francis arrives Saturday in Dublin to close out the conference with a Mass on Sunday in Dublin's Phoenix Park.

While the sex abuse crisis was always going to cloud Francis' trip, given Ireland's devastating history of abuse and cover-up, new revelations in the U.S. of misconduct and cover-up by the U.S. hierarchy have ensured that Francis' trip will be dominated by the issue.

Cardinal Sean O'Malley, Francis' top abuse adviser, had been expected to head the Dublin safeguarding discussion Friday but stayed home due to what he called ""serious pastoral needs"" in Boston. O'Malley launched an investigation into his diocesan seminary, and removed its rector, after reports of misconduct went public.

It's the third seminary — including Philadelphia and Seton Hall, New Jersey — that are now under church investigation because of reports of sexual misconduct and possible abuse.

In a letter read out to the conference, O'Malley apologized for not being there in person but made clear he believed that protecting children was the single most important issue facing the Catholic Church today.

""All endeavors at evangelization and other great works will be dependent upon our ability to own our crimes and failings and to make the protection of children and vulnerable adults our No. 1 priority,"" his message read.

Collins, who resigned in frustration from O'Malley's panel last year, was more direct in demanding accountability for abusers and those in the church hierarchy who covered up for them, including at the Vatican.

""Anyone in the Vatican who would stand in the way of proper protection of children should be accountable as well,"" she said. ""This accountability must have strong sanctions for the guilty: Dismissal from their post, removal of their titles and privileges and if necessary, removal from the clergy entirely.""

Collins also said Catholics should ask why the church routinely opposes removing the statute of limitations for victims to prosecute and sue abusers, and yet claims to be on the side of victims. In his letter this week to all the worlds Catholics, Francis insisted that he was ""on the side of victims.""

""The actions of the church do not match the words, and they are in fact totally the opposite,"" Collins said to applause.",world
"Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.) has worked to distance her political career from her husband's investment career, especially when it's negatively spotlighted in the press, but her husband’s investment company now employs McCaskill's former campaign spokesman to handle its press.

The wealth of McCaskill's husband, Joseph Shepard, has long caused political problems for the senator, most recently on Tuesday when the Kansas City Star reported that his businesses had received $131 million in federal subsidies since McCaskill took office in 2007. Last month the report was that Shepard had millions of dollars invested in a hedge fund using offshore tax havens.

McCaskill has responded to stories on Shepard's investments by saying she has no involvement in them, but in an apparent effort to mitigate damage to McCaskill's reelection effort, Shepard's company Sugar Creek has brought in the political consultant who helped McCaskill first get elected to the Senate in 2006 to handle its damage control efforts.

Tony Wyche is president of Soapbox, a public relations and political consulting company based in Missouri that still lists McCaskill as its top political client. His LinkedIn résumé shows a long track record of work in Democratic politics, including two-year stints as communications director for the Missouri Democratic Party and deputy press secretary for the Democratic National Committee. His company was paid $44,500 by McCaskill's 2006 campaign, throughout which he was quoted as her spokesman.

"As Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election continues, two former members of his team are under scrutiny for text messages they exchanged about President Trump and the probe.

In the messages, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who were romantically involved, bashed Trump and discussed concerns about being too tough on Hillary Clinton during an investigation into the use of her private email server.

Overall, the pair exchanged some 50,000 text messages throughout the presidential election and first year of the Trump administration, many of them with anti-Trump sentiments.

In one particular message, when Page asked if Trump would ever become president, Strzok reportedly replied, “No. No he won't. We'll stop it.”

Other text messages showed an allegiance for fired FBI Director James Comey.

The messages have not gone unnoticed by GOP lawmakers or Trump. Republicans have argued that their messages color the outcome of the Clinton email investigation and undercut the FBI’s ongoing investigation into Russian election interference. The president has often tweeted personal attacks at Page and Strzok and called the texts “hate filled and biased.”

The Justice Department's inspector general has criticized Strzok and Page for creating the appearance of impropriety through the texts. But the report said it found no evidence of political bias in the FBI's decision to not pursue criminal charges against Clinton.

Here’s a look at who exchanged the text messages – and who would eventually leave the FBI.

Peter Strzok

A veteran counterintelligence agent, Peter Strzok was assigned to both the investigation into Clinton’s personal email server and the special counsel’s probe into potential collusion between Trump officials and Russia during the election.

Strzok was removed from the Russia investigation after it was revealed that he exchanged anti-Trump text messages with Page, then a senior FBI lawyer.

Months later, in August 2018, Strzok was fired from the FBI, his attorney said.

According to the text messages, Strzok was hesitant to join Mueller’s investigation because of his “gut sense” that there was “no big there there.”

MUELLER PROBE ONE YEAR LATER: HOW THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION BECAME DC’S BIGGEST POLITICAL FOOTBALL

Strzok previously worked on investigations pertaining to Chinese and Russian espionage, according to The New York Times. ABC first reported that Strzok left the probe and was reassigned to the human resources division in August 2017.

After he was fired, Trump said ""finally"" and again criticized the legitimacy of the Russia investigation.

Lisa Page

A lawyer for the FBI, Lisa Page was only temporarily on Mueller’s team, but she discussed the investigation with Strzok.

Page warned Strzok via text about the FBI’s investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state, saying in February 2016 that she “might be our next president.”

“The last thing you need [is] going in there loaded for bear,” Page continued. “You think she’s going to remember or care that it was more [DOJ] than [FBI]?”

Page, who has ""deep experience [in] money laundering and organized crime cases,"" was removed from the investigation in September 2017. She left the FBI in May.

House lawmakers subpoenaed her to appear for a private interview in July. They said she was ""cooperative"" and ""credible"" in her closed-door interview that lasted for hours.

Andrew McCabe

A controversial figure at the FBI, deputy director Andrew McCabe was seemingly referenced by Page and Strzok in their text messages.

“I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office - that there’s no way he gets elected - but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk,” Strzok texted in August 2016. “It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40.”

US MARSHALS SERVED SUBPOENA ON FBI LAWYER LISA PAGE, LAWMAKER SAYS

Some lawmakers believed “Andy” to be a reference to McCabe.

In another text that same month, Strzok told Page that McCabe was concerned with “information control” about the investigation into Trump’s campaign.

McCabe, whose wife ran as a Democrat for a Virginia Senate seat with financial assistance from a group tied to Clinton, repeatedly faced criticism from Trump.

“How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin' James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife's campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?” Trump asked in a December 2017 tweet.

In January, McCabe was “removed” from his post, taking “terminal leave” until his planned retirement in March. However, he was ultimately fired before he was set to leave his post.

Robert Mueller

Special Counsel Robert Mueller was tasked with overseeing the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself.

A LOOK AT TRUMP’S LAWYERS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

Mueller led the FBI through the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and served under presidential administrations of both parties.

His Russia probe has led to charges for four former Trump campaign officials, although none of the charges directly stem from misconduct during the election.

"Buoyed by a dramatic last-minute rally by President Trump, Republican State Sen. Troy Balderson appeared to be inching closer to beating back a challenge by insurgent Democrat Danny O’Connor in Ohio's special election for a vacant House seat Tuesday.

A victory in the race for Ohio's historically conservative 12th Congressional District would deny Democrats the major upset they had sought ahead of the November midterm elections. The winner takes the seat previously held by Republican Pat Tiberi, who resigned in January to take another job.

Speaking to cheering supporters Tuesday night, Balderson said O'Connor ran a ""hard race"" and claimed victory. And in a tweet Tuesday night, Trump wrote that Balderson had won a ""great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting.""

But O'Connor has not conceded, and said in a statement released shortly before midnight that ""we don't know the results quite yet.""

The race remains too close to call. Balderson maintains a slim one-percentage point lead with all precincts reporting, but there are at least 3,435 provisional ballots left to be reviewed and 5,048 outstanding absentee ballots. That's enough for O'Connor to potentially pick up enough votes to force a mandatory recount.

Unofficial Ohio state election totals showed Balderson with 101,574 votes and O'Connor with 99,820 -- a mere 1,754 vote difference.

State officials said that boards of elections cannot begin counting those additional ballots until the 11th day after the election, August 18.

The mood at O'Connor's campaign headquarters at the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association in Westerville had been optimistic early Tuesday evening as results intially indicated he was significantly ahead in Ohio's 12th Congressional District. Trump won the district by 11 percentage points in 2016, and it has had a Republican representative for the last three decades.

The race was one of several key contests on Tuesday, but it has garnered outsized attention because several polls showed no real daylight between the candidates in traditionally deep-red district -- which some, including Ohio Gov. John Kasich, has said ""does not bode well"" for the GOP in the upcoming November midterm elections.

Also, while Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, and Washington state were holding primaries on Tuesday, only Ohio was sending someone to Congress immediately.

Despite the apparent win by Balderson, 57, on Tuesday, the candidates will square off again in less than 100 days in November's general election. But O'Connor is expected to have much less of a fighting chance -- and outside funding -- in the fall.

Trump Tuesday night predicted on Twitter that Balderson will ""win BIG"" in November's general election.

Late Tuesday, as it became clear Balderson had a lead with all precincts reporting, O'Connor sounded a determined but somber note in a speech at his campaign headquarters.

""This is a grassroots campaign powered by small donations and people who want the future for their community,"" he said. ""We won’t rest; we will keep fighting through to November.""

FOUR OTHER STATES HEAD TO THE POLLS ON TUESDAY -- WHAT ARE THE KEY RACES?

A state Republican party official told Fox News that officials there were ""cautiously optimistic"" Balderson would prevail early in the evening, citing high turnout in areas like rural Muskingum County that nearly ran out of paper ballots.

Trump may have played a significant role in the reportedly high turnout in the Ohio contest by staging a freewheeling rally in suburban Columbus on Saturday night. In a sweltering auditorium, Trump said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ""controls Danny O’Connor, whoever the hell that is.""

In his tweet Tuesday night, Trump wrote, ""When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson, he was down in early voting 64 to 36. That was not good. After my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better.""

Described by campaign operatives as a ""Whole Foods"" district, the largely suburban region features a more affluent and educated voter base than the typical Trump stronghold.

Balderson touted Trump's help, saying Monday that the president ""definitely brought major excitement, and they were excited to see him up here.""

""We won’t rest; we will keep fighting through to November."" - Democratic House candidate Danny O'Connor

Vice President Mike Pence also campaigned on Balderson's behalf, saying he has been on board with the president's agenda.

O'Connor has dominated Balderson on the local airwaves. His campaign spent $2.25 million on advertising compared to Balderson's $507,000, according to campaign tallies of ad spending. The Republican campaign arm and its allied super PAC were forced to pick up the slack, spending more than $4 million between them.

Kasich, a leading voice in the GOP's shrinking anti-Trump wing, once represented the district in Congress.

At times, the race has centered on Trump's tax cuts as much as the candidates. O'Connor and his Democratic allies have railed against the tax plan, casting it as a giveaway for the rich that exacerbates federal deficits and threatens Medicare and Social Security.

Democrats have also hammered Balderson for telling a local newspaper that he would consider raising the eligibility age for Medicare and Social Security.

Turkey's Foreign Minister on Friday warned against a possible Syrian government offensive on the last remaining stronghold of opposition against President Bashar Assad, while Russia indicated that it's losing its patience with the rebels.

Mevlut Cavusoglu, who was in Moscow for talks with Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, said that Russia and Turkey should work to separate opposition groups from ""terrorists"" in the northwestern province of Idlib. He warned against a government offensive there, saying that it will cause a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""

""Our goal is to alleviate the concerns of our Russian counterparts and get rid of the terrorists in that area,"" he told a briefing in Moscow. ""We can work together but we could be putting civilian lives at risk while eradicating those radical groups.

Russia, which has been a key backer of Assad, launched its operation in Syria in 2015, ultimately helping to turn the tide of the war in Assad's favor.

Turkey, which supports some of the opposition groups along its border with Syria, has mediated cease-fire deals in several areas in Syria, including Idlib. Russia and Iran, who back Assad, have also mediated cease-fires of their own. In most such cases, opposition groups on the verge of surrender gave up their fight and were evacuated to remaining areas outside government control, namely Idlib.

Taking Idlib by force would be a difficult challenge for Assad's forces. As talk of a new government offensive swirled earlier this week, the leader of Syria's al-Qaida affiliate that is based in the province, vowed to fight on there. Abu Mohammed al-Golani said on Wednesday that state-sponsored surrenders of rebel groups won't happen in Idlib like they did elsewhere, because they would be considered ""treason"" by his al-Qaida-linked fighters.

Russia's Lavrov on Friday indicated that Moscow was losing patience with the Idlib militants, whom the Kremlin has accused of targeting government positions as well as Russia's Syria military base from there.

Lavrov said on Friday that when Turkey, Iran and Russia originally negotiated the cease-fire zones, Moscow did not expect militants to be ""using it as a human shield"" from which they could attack the government.

Lavrov acknowledged that the situation in Idlib is ""complex"" and called for the separation of militants from legitimate opposition groups. He said Cavusoglu will stay on in Moscow to join a meeting later on Friday with top Russian and Turkish defense and intelligence officials to discuss the situation in Idlib.",world
"The Trump administration announced Friday that it is cutting nearly $300 million in planned funding for a United Nations agency that aids Palestinian refugees after finding the operation “irredeemably flawed.”

The State Department said in a statement that after contributing $60 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East in January, “the United States was no longer willing to shoulder the very disproportionate share.""

The U.S. gives some $364 million each year to the agency which provides health care, loans and other social services to Palestinian refugees in in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The U.S., which supplies nearly 30 percent of the total budget, is the largest contributor to the organization.

HALEY PRESSURES ARAB STATES TO STEP UP ON PALESTINIAN AID: ‘WE ARE NOT FOOLS’

President Trump has long called for other nations to step up and share the “burden of costs,” and while efforts have been made to address the issue, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said that “the overall international response has not been sufficient.”

“Beyond the budget gap itself and failure to mobilize adequate and appropriate burden sharing, the fundamental business model and fiscal practices that have marked UNRWA for years – tied to UNRWA’s endlessly and exponentially expanding community of entitled beneficiaries – is simply unsustainable and has been in crisis mode for many years,” Nauert said.

“The United States will no longer commit further funding to this irredeemably flawed operation.”

The UNRWA released a statement on the U.S.’s decision to withdraw funding.

“We regret the United States’ decision to provide no further funding to UNRWA, which provides essential services to Palestine refugees and contributes to stability in the region,” the statement said. “The US has traditionally been the largest single contributor to UNRWA. We appreciate its support over the years.”

It also called on other countries to “fill in the remaining financial gap” so the organization could continue to provide assistance to the “vulnerable” Palestinian population.

UN’S SCATHING REPORTS STOKE US CONCERNS ABOUT ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS

UNRWA was set up in the wake of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war to deal with displaced Palestinians, but is a frequent target of Israel, which claims it perpetuates a “right of return” that Israel rejects. Trump vowed early on in his presidency that the U.S. will no longer fund agencies and countries that do not support its interests.

The State Department said it will continue dialogue with the U.N. about new approaches.

“Palestinians, wherever they live, deserve better than an endlessly crisis-driven service provision model. They deserve to be able to plan for the future.”

"Washington Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal is among the more than 500 protesters who were arrested inside a Capitol office building on Thursday while demonstrating against President Trump’s policies on illegal immigration.

The protest, which included hundreds demonstrators, took place in the Hart Senate Office Building. The protesters were calling for the abolishment of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and were heard chanting “abolish ICE."" Most of the protesters were female.

Eva Malecki, a spokeswoman for the United States Capitol Police, said 575 individuals were charged with unlawfully demonstrating in the atrium of the building.

“I was just arrested with 500+ women and @WomensMarch to say @RealDonaldTrump’s cruel zero-tolerance policy will not continue. Not in our country. Not in our name. June 30 we’re putting ourselves in the street again,” Jayapal tweeted.

It is rare that the Capitol Police would arrest a member on Capitol grounds. The protesters were arrested for demonstrating inside the building, according to two police officers. The officers said the protesters could have demonstrated outside but were arrested for being inside.

New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand also appeared at the demonstration, calling it “an amazing protest of women speaking out to be heard.”

“People across my state of New York, all across the country are furious with this administration’s policy to separate children from their parents,” Gillibrand said.

After an outcry over the separation of parents and children at the border, Trump last week signed an executive order to allow children to stay with parents caught crossing the border illegally.

At one point, protesters and police were seen battling over the signs in the building. Capitol police were seen trying to rip down “abolish ICE” signs from the balconies, but the protestors were keep trying to take them back and hang them up.

"An Australian Instagram model who died after she was found unconscious on a Mexican billionaire’s super yacht in Greece hanged herself, the Greek coroner’s office said Monday.

The coroner told Britain’s The Sunday Times that Sinead McNamara had killed herself using a thick rope. The 20-year-old model was found hanging from an upper deck on the Mayan Queen IV just before 2 a.m. Friday in the Greek port of Argostoli in Kefalonia.

A captain on a neighboring boat had discovered McNamara and yelled for help, news.com.au reported.

A doctor on the yacht, as well as other crewmembers, attempted to revive McNamara before authorities arrived at the scene. She died in the helicopter on the way to the hospital.

The coroner said McNamara was “unconscious, but not dead” when she was found on the 300-foot yacht owned by billionaire businessman Alberto Bailleres. The mining magnate was not on the $140 million yacht during the incident.

A toxicology test is being conducted. No suicide note was found at the scene.

INSTAGRAM MODEL FOUND DEAD ON MEXICAN BILLIONAIRE'S YACHT IN GREECE; MYSTERIOUS DEATH INVESTIGATED

Several details about McNamara’s death remain unclear, including what led to her suicide. The model had been working on the yacht as a stewardess for the last four months and had worked her final shift before she was set to reunite with her mother and sister, news.com.au reported. She posted on Instagram days before her death saying she was excited to see her sister.

A post shared by Salt Bby 💦 (@sineadmcnamara) on Aug 19, 2018 at 6:07am PDT

“Happy birthday to the most amazing big sister I could ever ask for, 5 days till I get to see you!! Excitement is an understatement,” she wrote.

Earlier in the month, the model shared a cryptic post, writing: ""My head is all over the shop today...take me back to this where my only worry was not cracking my skull open.""

Authorities are also searching McNamara’s text messages and reviewing security footage that captured her last moments.

The super yacht was initially ordered to remain at the port during the investigation into McNamara’s death. Police allowed the yacht to sail on Sunday after all the crewmembers were interviewed by police.

"College students in Arizona who participate in the Obama-era DACA program are no longer eligible for cheaper “in-state” tuition, the state’s Supreme Court ruled this week.

The ruling affects so-called Dreamers who attend Arizona’s three state universities and its largest community college.

The unanimous ruling Monday will affect at least 2,000 students who participate in DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which began in 2012 and which President Donald Trump has been looking to scrap or change since taking office in 2017.

The court said it would issue a written opinion explaining its reasoning by May 14.

The high court heard arguments last week in connection with the case.

The Arizona Supreme Court said it was making its decision known quickly to give the district and its students, as well as the state, as much time as possible for planning.

The case was filed under former Attorney General Tom Horne and continued by current Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who issued a statement saying his duty was to uphold the law.

""While people can disagree what the law should be, I hope we all can agree that the attorney general must enforce the law as it is, not as we want it to be,"" the statement said.

""While people can disagree what the law should be, I hope we all can agree that the attorney general must enforce the law as it is, not as we want it to be."" - Mark Brnovich, Arizona attorney general

Matt Hasson, spokesman for the Maricopa County Community Colleges District, said the district was disappointing.

""This ruling is troubling for the 2,000 DACA students currently enrolled in Maricopa Community Colleges,"" he said in a statement. ""During the past five years, more than 600 DACA students earned an associate's degree or a certificate from one of our colleges and are making valuable contributions to the health of our economy.""

The chair of the state Board of Regents also lamented the decision, which came in a case pursued by the attorney general after the community college district began allowing DACA students to pay in-state tuition several years ago.

A lower court in 2015 rejected the attorney general's contention that lower tuition violated a voter-approved 2006 law known as Proposition 300 that prohibits public benefits for anyone living in Arizona without legal immigration status.

The university system used that ruling to offer lower tuition and continued the practice when the Court of Appeals ruled last year that federal and state law don't allow lower tuition for DACA students.

A current community college student taking a full-time course load would see tuition go from about $2,580 a year to about $8,900 a year. The state's three universities have a policy of charging residents without citizenship 150 percent of in-state tuition, moving tuition from about $10,000 a year to $15,000 per year.

Many young people covered by the DACA program, who are known as Dreamers, had said their school plans would be derailed if they lost access to lower in-state fees.

""Not only does this put education out of reach for most students, many will simply drop out from this disappointing decision,"" said Edder Diaz Martinez, a DACA recipient himself and a founding member of Undocumented Students for Education Equity, a group representing immigrant students at Arizona State University.

"President Trump, in an exclusive interview with Fox News' Ainsley Earhardt, warned that the “market would crash” if he's ever impeached -- while questioning why Democrats would even consider that course in the future.

“I don’t know how you can impeach somebody who’s done a great job,” Trump said, in the interview which aired Thursday on ""Fox & Friends.""

The president weighed in on calls from the left to pursue impeachment if Democrats seize the House in the midterms. That speculation kicked up following the plea deal struck by his former attorney Michael Cohen claiming the president was involved in hush-money payments and admitting campaign finance violations related to them.

The president argued that he's done a great job in office, despite the critical coverage in connection with the Cohen case and other controversies.

Further, he warned, “If I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, I think everybody would be very poor, because without this thinking, you would see — you would see numbers that you wouldn’t believe in reverse.”

The president touted his economic accomplishments, claiming that the economy was going to be “down” if he hadn’t been elected.

“I freed up, I got rid of regulations, the tax cut was a tremendous thing,” Trump said.

He added: “Had Hillary and the Democrats gotten in, had she been president, you would have had negative growth. We picked up $10 trillion worth.”

Impeachment talk is still confined to certain corners of the Democratic Party. Top House Democrats have largely pushed back on calls to pursue that option, though some have kept the door open.

Many Democrats have said the Cohen plea creates legal risks for Trump. ""The factual basis of the plea, potentially implicating the president in illegal campaign finance violations, adds to the president’s legal jeopardy,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., top House Intelligence Committee Democrat, said in a statement.

The president also hit on immigration in the interview — saying “we’re doing a record-breaking job, but we have bad laws.”

“You know when you have bad laws you can do good. But you can do a lot better if you had good laws. So they’ll all get changed, but we have to elect more Republicans,” Trump said.

The president was asked about the murder of 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts, whom he called “a beautiful young girl.”

“She was killed by a horrible person that came in from Mexico, illegally here. Found by ICE, our great ICE who’s abused by the Democrats and the left. And without them, you might not be sitting here so comfortably right now. I just think it’s so sad,” Trump said.

Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, in the U.S. illegally from Mexico, was charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday in Tibbetts’ death. He is currently being held on a federal immigration detainer.

“We’re building the wall. It’s already started. We’ve spent $3.2 billion on it. We’re asking for $5 billion for this year’s funding. The wall is going up. A lot of people don’t know it,” Trump said.

He added that he would “like to build it even faster,” but said working with the Democrats is “very tough.”

“We’re doing an incredible job,” Trump said.

The president said he would give himself and his presidency, thus far, an “A plus.”

“I don’t think any president has ever done what I’ve done in this short, we haven’t even been two years, biggest tax cuts in history, soon-to-be two unbelievable Supreme Court justices—I’m sure that Justice Kavanaugh will be approved, Justice Gorsuch has been a star,” Trump said. “You look at all of the things we’ve done with regulations, the economy is the best it’s ever been in history.”

Trump announced Brett Kavanaugh as his choice to replace retired Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy on the bench. His confirmation hearing is expected in the Senate in early September, though some Democrats are pushing for delays after the Cohen plea.

The one area where Trump said he was not succeeding was with the media.

“The only thing I’m doing badly on is the press doesn’t cover me fairly,” Trump said. “I thought after I won, you know, they killed me during the campaign. Just killed me. I said well, one good thing about winning, I’ve showed them, so now I’m going to get fair press.”

He added: “Guess what, it got worse. It’s worse.”

The president has routinely mocked and attacked media outlets — like CNN, NBC, The New York Times, and The Washington Post -- over critical stories that he often disputes. Last week, more than 300 publications across the country participated in coordinated editorial columns promoting freedom of the press and criticizing Trump.

Trump went on to criticize the media coverage of his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, last month.

“My meeting with Putin was a tremendous success, I got killed by the fake news,” Trump said. “They wanted me to go up and punch him in the face. I said I want to get along with Russia. I want to get along with everybody.”

He added: “They said I was too rough on North Korea, remember that, too rough. But with Putin, they said I was too soft.”

The president angered members of both parties at the Putin summit by saying both countries share blame for damaged relations and by not firmly standing by U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections.

Trump praised his wife, Melania Trump, for her grace through negative media coverage of the first family and his administration.

“She is doing great. She's a terrific woman. She goes through a lot with all this publicity. But she's a terrific woman, she's doing great,” Trump said, adding that unfavorable coverage and publicity is “part of my life.”

He added: “I’ve always won. I’ve always won. It was controversial when I ran, and I won, and now the country’s doing better than it’s ever done.”",politics
"The Pentagon says it has suspended $300 milllion in military aid to Pakistan for not doing enough to battle terrorists groups inside its borders.

The announcement comes ahead of an expected trip to Islamabad by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the U.S. military’s top officer, Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

In January, the Pentagon suspended nearly $1 billion in aid to Pakistan for what Defense Secretary James Mattis and other top officials said at the time was Islamabad’s failure to take on the Haqqani terrorist network.

That network is believed to be holding western hostages, including Kevin King, a U.S. professor from American University in Kabul who was abducted along with an Australian colleague two years ago. King was last seen in a ""proof-of-life"" video, released last October.

"One flight out of D.C. certainly brought awkward to new heights.

A photo obtained by Politico Playbook showed both Special Counsel Robert Mueller and Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, waiting at gate 35X at Reagan National Airport on Friday morning.

Mueller can be seen seated and reading a newspaper; Trump Jr. is standing against the wall on his phone.

From the photo, it's unclear whether the two men are oblivious to one another or deliberately avoiding eye contact.

But while it might appear Mueller is now physically closing in on Trump's inner circle, the special counsel's office assured Fox News he didn't know the presidential son was there.

""If it’s accurate that the other person in the photo was Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Mueller was not aware of him and had no interaction with him,"" spokesman Peter Carr said.

Fox News confirmed that the person in the photo is the president's son. A source said he didn’t know Mueller was in his midst.

Mueller is spearheading the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election – which has at times scrutinized the actions of Donald Trump Jr., himself, notably the infamous Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer and others.

Trump and his eldest son routinely deride what they call the ""witch hunt,"" with the president hammering the probe again Friday morning as he denied a reported claim from his ex-attorney that he knew about the Trump Tower meeting.

"The daughter of a British couple who died at an Egyptian resort hotel last week under mysterious circumstances said Sunday that she believes something in her parent's room killed them.

John and Susan Cooper died last Tuesday morning while on vacation at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Hurghada. The deaths of the couple, ages 69 and 63, prompted travel company Thomas Cook to evacuate 300 guests from the hotel as a precaution.

The couple's daughter, Kelly Ormerod, said she is suspicious because her parents had been in perfect health hours before they died. She told Sky News that her father, John Cooper died in his room while her mother died after she was taken to the hospital.

""I think when they went back to that room that evening there was something in that room that's actually killed them - whether they've inhaled something that poisoned them, I don't know,"" she told Sky News. ""I can only have my opinion on what's gone on, but there's something that happened in that room that killed my parents.""

On Sunday, Thomas Cook Group CEO Peter Fankhauser told Sky News the company has brought in experts to test food, water, and air conditioning systems at the Egyptian resort hotel.

""There is no evidence that it is a carbon monoxide poisoning. We have no evidence but I don't want to rule out anything before I really know the cause,"" he said.

Fankhauser told Sky News that experts have taken ""probes of the food, of the hygienic systems, of water, as well as the air conditioning systems and all those probes are now in Egypt,"" and that tests should take 10 days to complete.

THOMAS COOK TAKES ITS GUESTS OUT OF EGYPT HOTEL AFTER 2 DIED

Besides the deaths of the couple, it has emerged that 13 other customers at the hotel had food poisoning. The hotel told The Associated Press in an email that there was no increased level of illness there and attributed the couple's deaths to ""natural causes.""

Prosecutors in Egypt on Saturday dismissed speculation that toxic gas fumes in the Coopers' hotel room killed the couple. An official inspection of the room found no harmful gas leaks and all the devices worked properly, they said.

The Egyptian prosecutor's office said it is awaiting a forensic analysis of samples taken from the bodies to provide more details, according to the AP.

Egyptian authorities dismissed criminal motives as being behind the deaths. An official statement by the Red Sea governorate on Friday said an initial medical examination of John Cooper showed he had suffered acute circulatory collapse and a sudden cardiac arrest. It said Susan Cooper later fainted and was rushed to a hospital, where resuscitation attempts continued for a half-hour.

"CNN is standing by its “scoop” that Michael Cohen had information that President Trump knew in advance about the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian officials despite the source for a related story walking back the claims.

A CNN report from July 27 headlined, “Cohen claims Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting,” was co-bylined by Jim Sciutto, Carl Bernstein and Marshall Cohen. It cited “sources with knowledge” and noted that the ex-Trump lawyer is willing tell Special Counsel Robert Mueller that Trump knew of the meeting in advance, contradicting repeated denials by Trump and his surrogates. CNN’s report resulted in countless cable news segments and sent other news organizations scurrying to match.

Among them was The Washington Post, which has since outed Cohen’s high-powered attorney Lanny Davis as its source -- while publishing an interview in which Davis backpedals.

Davis told The Washington Post Sunday that he “should have been more clear” that he “could not independently confirm what happened.” Davis even told the Post he regrets his “error.”

The newspaper's original version was not as damaging as CNN’s and didn’t mention Donald Trump Jr. allegedly telling his father that the meeting was with Russians, which CNN reported. The latest Davis interview, though, raised questions about a slew of related stories.

“Davis’s latest comments cast doubt on what Cohen may know, including about a June 2016 meeting in New York’s Trump Tower attended by Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer,” the Post wrote on Sunday night. “Davis told The Washington Post that he cannot confirm media reports that Cohen is prepared to tell special counsel Robert S. Mueller III that Trump had advance knowledge of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting.”

While the Washington Post outed Davis as its source and essentially issued a quasi-correction, CNN is standing by its reporting.

“Pro-Trump web sites are claiming that the CNN story was a ‘lie,’ and that it's been ‘debunked.’ They might want it to be ‘debunked,’ but it's not. The critics don't know who CNN's sources were,” CNN’s media newsletter stated in a blurb that referred to the original story as a “scoop.”

Trump has denied knowledge all along and fired back following CNN’s report last month.

“I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary’s lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!” Trump tweeted on July 27.

""We stand by our story, and are confident in our reporting of it,"" a CNN spokesperson told the Post.

Davis began walking back the allegations last week, when during an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, he was asked whether there was evidence that Trump knew about the meeting before it happened.

“No, there’s not,” Davis said.

Axios reported last week that Cohen even told Congress he doesn’t know if Trump knew about the meeting in advance. Trump, again, maintained that he knew nothing of the meeting beforehand, and blasted the reports as ‘fake news.’

On Sunday, Trump Jr. blasted CNN as “literal fake news,” saying it was “Comical” to watch CNN “covering” for its reporters who “obviously got [the] story wrong.”

CNN has been slammed by critics since Davis backpedaled. Daily Caller media editor Amber Athey said the new information puts CNN’s reporting on “shaky ground” and The Daily Wire wrote that there is “mounting evidence debunking CNN's report.”

"Voters are increasingly divided over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court since President Trump announced him as his choice to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy.

Forty-five percent would confirm Kavanaugh, while 46 percent oppose him, according to the latest Fox News poll.

Last month, voters supported him by a 38-32 percent margin. Many voters at that time, 30 percent, had no opinion on Kavanaugh’s nomination. That makes sense, given interviews for the July poll were conducted July 10-11, which was soon after the president’s July 9 prime-time announcement of his selection.

READ THE COMPLETE POLL RESULTS.

Since July, support for Kavanaugh is up 15 points among Republicans (was 70, now 85 percent), while opposition among Democrats is up 20 points (was 58, now 78 percent).

There’s a gender gap too, as men (53 percent) are 15 points more likely than women (38 percent) to support his confirmation.

Many other nominees received similar mixed support. For example, voters backed the confirmation of President Trump’s first nominee Neil Gorsuch by a 45-39 percent margin (March 2017), and former President Obama’s second nominee Elena Kagan by 38-36 percent (June 2010). In addition, trend going back to 2005 shows that only two nominees garnered majority support: John Roberts received 51 percent support in July 2005 and Sonya Sotomayor got 53 percent in July 2009.

The new survey, released Thursday, also finds voters split over whether Senate Democrats should do “everything they can” to block any of President Trump’s Supreme Court nominees: 45 percent say yes, while 42 percent disagree. Among Democrats, 75 percent think their party’s leaders should do everything they can to oppose Trump nominees.

On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer requested a delay in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Kavanaugh’s nomination, stating: “Kavanaugh’s refusal to say that a president must comply with a duly issued subpoena, and Michael Cohen’s implication of the president in a federal crime, makes the danger of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court abundantly clear. It’s a game changer. Should be.”

Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty Tuesday to campaign-finance violations and other charges.

When the president revealed his selection of Kavanaugh in July, Senate Democrats called for delaying the vote on his nomination until after November’s midterm elections. According to polling conducted at that time, voters disagree with that, saying the Senate should vote before the midterms by a 50-42 percent margin.

The Senate is scheduled to begin Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings September 4.

Pollpourri

More voters view Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer negatively than positively by 14 points (28 favorable vs. 42 unfavorable). Other leaders fare even worse. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is viewed more negatively by 25 points (29-54 percent), House Speaker Paul Ryan is underwater by 20 points (31-51 percent), and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has a net negative of minus 30 (22-52 percent).

For comparison, voters rate Trump negatively by 16 points (41 favorable vs. 57 unfavorable).

Nearly half of voters, 46 percent, have a “strongly” unfavorable opinion of Trump. The next highest on that measure? Pelosi, at 35 percent “strongly” unfavorable.

Among the party faithful, Trump does best. Among Republicans, 83 percent have a favorable view, while Ryan comes in at 57 percent and McConnell 36 percent. Among Democrats, 46 percent have a favorable opinion of Pelosi and 39 percent of Schumer.

Voters view the Democratic Party more positively than the Republican Party.

Opinion of the GOP is upside down by 17 points (39 favorable vs. 56 unfavorable), while the Democratic Party is rated positively by 4 points (50 favorable vs. 46 unfavorable).

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,009 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from August 19-21, 2018.

"A Dutch city council member reportedly committed suicide just hours after posting a video online in which she claimed to have been gang-raped by a group of Muslims who were following the orders of a former fellow member of her anti-immigration PVV party.

Willie Dille, a 53-year-old who represented the PVV in parliament from 2010 to 2012 and later became a city councilor at The Hague, killed herself Wednesday after she “could no longer bear what had happened to her and the reactions she had had,” local PVV leader Karen Gerbrands told Dutch News.

In a video Dille reportedly posted online earlier in the day, she claimed former PVV parliament member Arnoud van Doorn – who apparently disliked her -- ordered the attack, which allegedly happened in early 2017.

The video reportedly showed Dille pale and thin-looking. She claimed she was told by the attackers to keep quiet in the council debating chamber, amongst other threats she said to have received. The footage ended with her saying she was resigning her council seat, Dutch News reported.

The mayor of The Hague, Pauline Krikke, described Dille in a statement as someone who was “involved and passionate” with politics, the website added.

Van Doorn, however, denies the alleged attack and says he is weighing his legal options after his name surfaced.

Police also told the AD newspaper that Dille never made a formal complaint to them about the alleged attack.

"Following the historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, President Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to share a video that was shown to Kim during their historic Singapore sitdown.

The video, “A Story of Opportunity,” begins with various images highlighting both American and North Korean culture and seems to be a trailer of what’s envisioned as a lasting product of the summit.

“History may appear to repeat itself for generations, cycles that never seem to end,” the narrator intones. “There comes a time where only a few are called upon to make a difference, but the question is, what difference will the few make?” he says as images of Trump and Kim appear.

"Aaron Schock, the former Republican congressman who resigned from office in 2015 amid spending scrutiny, told Fox News on Thursday that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Central Illinois has shown a “lack of judgment” throughout its investigation and called its current case a ""fishing expedition.""

The 36-year-old from Peoria was indicted in 2016 on charges of misusing funds. He resigned amid scrutiny of his spending, including to redecorate his Capitol Hill office in the style of the television show ""Downton Abbey.""

Schock told Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle” that he was unfairly targeted by a district attorney’s office that saw him as a rising Republican star and could not resist a chance to “move up the ladder in the Justice Department.”

He said the Department of Justice often defers to local district attorneys to “run their little fiefdom.”

Schock said the office wired up an informant illegally during its investigation and used his Fifth Amendment rights against him.

In 2017, federal Judge Colin Bruce concluded that the lead prosecutor, Timothy Bass, appeared to give inaccurate information to the court about prosecutors informing a grand jury that Schock was subpoenaed and did not appear, Politico reported.

“In fact they had used my Fifth Amendment rights against me 11 times on 11 different occasions,” he told Fox News.

Schock said the case has national implications because it involves the Justice Department reinterpreting House rules.

“They [DOJ] infringed upon the Constitutional Rights of Congress, as well, to make and interpret its own rules,” he said.

He said some of the accusations against him are “almost laughable.”

“According to House rules, you can buy fixtures and not furniture, and so the government has come in and said, “that’s not a fixture, that’s a piece of furniture”…again a false statement to a federal agent-- a 20 year felony.” - Aaron Schock on “The Ingraham Angle”

The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment when reached by Fox News.

Schock has been investigated for how he spent his office allowance and campaign funds. He used two examples to claim the government is reaching with its charges.

He said the Congress Finance Office accepted his office's estimate of the amount of miles he drove in his district to be reimbursed. The government, however, would not accept the estimates.

He said he faces another 20 years for identifying a light in his office as a light fixure.

“According to House rules, you can buy fixtures and not furniture, and so the government has come in and said, “that’s not a fixture, that’s a piece of furniture”…again a false statement to a federal agent -- a 20-year felony.”

The New York Times reported that Schock's office was painted blood red and had a plume of pheasant feathers. He personally paid back $40,000 for the renovations, the report said.

The Urbana-based Bruce was removed from hearing all his criminal cases after it was revealed he exchanged emails with an employee at the U.S. attorney's office in which he commented on and joked about one of his trials in progress at the time.

It isn't known what the change in judges and several pending motions will do for the case timetable, which has a trial beginning early next year.

"A U.S. Army Special Forces soldier, who was supporting Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, has died from wounds he received in a bomb blast in Afghanistan’s southern Helmand Province, the Pentagon announced Monday.

Sgt. 1st Class Reymund Rarogal Transfiguracion, 36, of Waikoloa, Hawaii, died Sunday at a hospital in Germany. He was wounded five days earlier after an improvised explosive device detonated near him while he was on patrol.

The Pentagon told Fox News that the incident is under investigation.

Transfiguracion was a staff sergeant when he was wounded, but was posthumously promoted to sergeant first class, said Maj. Beth Riordan, spokeswoman for 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne).

He was an engineer assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group, based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.

Born in the Philippines, Transfiguracion enlisted in the Hawaii National Guard in 2001.

He joined the active duty Army in 2008, and later went through Special Forces training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Transfiguracion deployed to Iraq in 2005 and 2008, and then went to the Philippines in 2010 for six months, Riordan said. His latest war tour in Afghanistan started in March.

Among his numerous awards, Transfiguracion received a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart and a Meritorious Service Medal as a result of his Afghanistan service. It was the second Purple Heart he received during his military career.

He was awarded a posthumous Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart and the Meritorious Service Medal, Riordan told Fox News in a statement.

"Immigration officials blasted a New Jersey county Monday after more than three dozen illegal immigrants were arrested there during a five-day sweep.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 37 people in Middlesex County, including 16 people who were released from the Middlesex County Jail, officials said in a news release. ICE blasted the county for not cooperating with federal law enforcement.

“Middlesex County, which aspires to be a 'sanctuary county' by protecting criminal aliens, in the process assists criminals in undermining federal law, and creates a dangerous environment in the community,” Ruben Perez, acting field office director of Enforcement and Removal Operations in the agency’s Newark office, said in a statement.

ICE had issued a detainer request asking the Middlesex County Jail to hold illegal immigrants until they could be picked up by federal officers, according to NJ.com. The jail ignored the request and released the immigrants without notifying ICE.

Middlesex County officials denied being a “sanctuary county” in a statement to NJ.com.

“To the contrary, Middlesex County has adopted a policy regarding interaction with ICE by county corrections and sheriff's department personnel which provides that the county will honor a detainer request from ICE if the inmate has previously been convicted of a first or second degree offense or was the subject of a Final Order of Deportation signed by a federal judge,” officials said. “By honoring these detainer requests the county has as its primary goal the protection of the public safety of our residents.”

The ages of those arrested during the sweep ranged from 21 to 68, ICE said. They hailed from 13 countries, including Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Ivory Coast, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, and Turkey, officials said.",politics
"A string of powerful blasts from the direction of a military airport in Damascus lit up the skies and shook the capital city in the early morning hours on Sunday, residents and state TV reported.

The explosions were seen and heard coming from the direction of the Mezzeh airport, southwest of the capital. The airport has been targeted in a number of airstrikes in recent years that the government has blamed on Israel.

The state-run Al-Ikhbariya TV station showed what appeared to be hand-held footage shot by residents of the capital capturing a string of bright explosions lighting up the night sky.

The TV station reported, citing an unnamed military source, that the explosions did not come from inside the airport but from a nearby munitions depot. The station said an electrical short circuit was to blame, and reported that emergency services were at the scene.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the explosions came from inside the Mezzeh air base and said they were likely caused by an Israeli missile strike.

Israel rarely acknowledges strikes inside Syria but has said it would use military action to prevent weapons transfers to its enemies. Israel is alarmed by the the expansion of operations by Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah to support President Bashar Assad in Syria's seven-year-long civil war.

The blasts come at a tense moment, as Syrian government forces prepare to attack the last refuge of the opposition in the northwest of the country. The U.S. is warning Damascus against using chemical weapons in the battle, while Damascus alleges that the U.S. is preparing to falsify a chemical attack to justify military operations on Syria.

The U.S., France, and the U.K. struck military installations around Damascus in April this year after a chlorine gas attack against rebels under siege outside the capital.",world

Former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet was 23 years old when she was tortured and fled her country's dictatorship into exile. Now, more than four decades later, she will face her past fighting such abuses worldwide as the new U.N. human rights chief.

Bachelet, 66, is often seen smiling, chatting easily or tossing unplanned comments or jokes into her speeches. But behind her good humor lie haunting memories of the brutal dictatorship that tore her family apart.

Her father, air force Gen. Alberto Bachelet, died in 1974 following months of torture in prison. Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military had convicted him of being a traitor for opposing the 1973 military coup that ousted President Salvador Allende.

Bachelet herself was arrested along with her mother in 1975. She was a young member of the Socialist Party, and her time in a secret prison was an ordeal that she prefers not to talk about, saying only in her autobiography that she suffered ""physical hardships.""

Using the family's political connections, she went into exile in Australia and the former East Germany. There she reunited with her then-partner, Jaime Lopez.

At age 25, Lopez became one of the leaders of the Socialist Party that had seen many of its members tortured, killed or forcibly disappeared by Chile's military dictatorship. He returned to Chile, but only briefly because he feared he would be captured by Pinochet's agents.

Back in Europe, Bachelet reminded him of the importance of committing to the cause and her father's sacrifice, according to ""Bachelet. The Unofficial Story,"" by Javier Ortega and Andrea Insunza.

""My dad died because he was consistent. I expect nothing less from you,"" the book says Bachelet told her then-boyfriend.

When he followed her advice, Lopez was captured in Chile. Under torture, he gave Pinochet's secret police information on other members of the Socialist Party, before he became one of the about 1,000 people who were forcibly disappeared during the dictatorship.

Her father's death and her boyfriend's disappearance marked Bachelet's character. Despite this, she never held grudges - not even against the Chilean military, said Giorgio Agostini, a sociologist who has long-known Bachelet and has written about her life.

Bachelet returned to Chile in 1979 when she felt she could do so safely. She studied medicine, specializing in pediatrics, and began working at an organization that helped children with mental health problems whose parents had been victims of the 1973-90 dictatorship.

Bachelet rose through the ranks of the Socialist Party and became a key player in the center-left coalition that dominated Chile's government for almost 20 years after Pinochet lost power.

Putting her traumatic past behind, she helped the discredited military regain its status in the wake of Pinochet's dictatorship.

One of her emblematic moments came when she was named Latin America's first woman defense minister during the government of President Ricardo Lagos. She continued to break boundaries when she became Chile's first women president in 2006.

After her term, she was named the first head of UN Women, the world body's new women's agency. She left the post to return to Chile and won the presidency again, serving from 2014-18.

Bachelet is known as a caring single mother, a hard worker and an astute negotiator.

In her new post as the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, she replaces Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein, a diplomat and member of Jordan's royal family.

Diplomats from the U.N.'s 193-member states burst into applause in July when the General Assembly president gave official approval to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' selection of Bachelet.

But in Chile, some human rights groups criticize her record, saying that as president she failed to close a special prison for dictatorship-era criminals that provided them with comforts they wouldn't enjoy in regular confinement.

Guterres has said that Bachelet is taking office ""at a time of grave consequence for human rights.""

""Hatred and inequality are on the rise,"" he said. ""Respect for international humanitarian and human rights law is on the decline. Space for civil society is shrinking. Press freedoms are under pressure.""

On Monday, Bachelet's third day in her new job, a Myanmar court sentenced two journalists from Reuters news agency to seven years in prison on charges of illegal possession of official documents.

The ruling was met with international condemnation that will add to outrage over the military's human rights abuses against Rohingya Muslims.

""On several issues related to different parts of the world,"" Bachelet told reporters in Geneva on Monday, ""I need to gather more information and make a deep analysis. But I have to mention how shocked I am after finding out about their seven-year prison sentences.""

She called on the Myanmar government to release the journalists and said that their trial breached international standards.

Bachelet will face many other challenges, chief among them, how to get dictators, autocrats, tyrants and demagogues to respect human rights.

She also comes to the job soon after President Donald Trump's national security adviser told the Associated Press that the United States will cut funding for the U.N. human rights chief's office.

Bachelet also faces a decision on how outspoken she will be on what she sees as human rights violations. Zeid told U.N. reporters last month that ""silence does not earn you any respect — none.""

Zeid said he will give his successor the same advice his predecessor, Navi Pillay, gave him — ""be fair and don't discriminate against any country"" and ""just come out swinging.""

Globally, Bachelet will also have to tackle the persecution of religious minorities and homosexuals in Africa and the Middle East, and the use of banned weapons on civilian populations.

In Latin America, she will face an economic and governance crisis that has forced more than two million Venezuelans to flee their country, as we well as violence under an official crackdown in Nicaragua.

""Those who defend human rights and the victims look up to the High Commissioner and hope that we are there to defend and support them,"" Bachelet said Monday. ""And I'll do everything on my side to make sure that we do so.""

Her deep resume will work in her favor, said Heraldo Munoz, who served as her foreign minister.

""She knows presidents and prime ministers who will pick up the phone (when she calls them),"" Munoz said. ""That can be a very important mechanism to try to resolve human rights problems through dialogue.""

"U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May came under pressure from opposition lawmakers Wednesday to cancel President Trump’s upcoming visit over his administration's controversial treatment of families caught illegally crossing the border.

Trump is due to arrive in the U.K. for a working visit on July 13, where he plans to meet with May. But opposition MPs who have long tried to head off a Trump visit seized on the immigration debate to suggest May rescind her invitation.

The Scottish National Party’s Ian Blackford, citing the practice, asked May in Parliament: “Is the Prime Minister still intending to roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump?”



“On the very important issue that he’s raised, of what we have seen in the United States, the pictures of children being held in what appear to be cages are deeply disturbing,” May responded. ""This is wrong. This is not something we agree with. This is not the United Kingdom’s approach.”



But she also defended the U.S.-U.K. visit while being heckled by opposition MPs who yelled “shame.”



“We have a special and longstanding relationship with the United States and I think it is right there will be a range of issues I will be discussing with President Trump ... and I think it’s important that we make sure that when we see the president of the United States here in the United Kingdom we’re able to have those discussions,” she said.

The discord in London marks the latest political and diplomatic fallout from a policy that Trump and congressional Republicans are scrambling to address.

At issue is the practice of separating children from parents caught crossing the border illegally. It stems from the implementation of a “zero tolerance” policy calling for prosecutions across the board. Families are in turn being separated, because of a policy that predates this administration barring children from being held in those facilities for an extended period.

Trump on Wednesday signed an executive action keeping families together, while congressional Republicans work on legislation.

In London, the raucous scene was similar to the protests in Washington and other U.S. cities.

Blackford called May's answer “disappointing,” sparking groans from Tory MPs, and then went on to criticize the U.K.’s policy of indefinite detention of some illegal immigrants awaiting deportation.

The topic of child separation in the U.S. and Trump's visit came up again later in the session.



“President Trump has locked up 2,000 little children in cages and is refusing to release them unless he is allowed to build a wall. He has quit the U.N. Human Rights Council, praised Kim Jong Un’s treatment of his own people, turned away Muslims,” Labour Party MP Gavin Shuker said. “What does this man have to do to have the invitation she has extended revoked?”

May reiterated that she considers the U.S. stance wrong but reminded the chamber on the importance of the special relationship.



“When we disagree with the United States, we tell them so,” she said. “But we also have some key shared interests with the United States, in the security and defense field and in other areas as well, and it is right that we are able to sit down and discuss those with the president of a country with which we have had a longstanding ... special relationship.”

Left-wing Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn did not call for May to cancel the visit, but on Tuesday called the situation ""immoral.""

Not all voices in the U.K. were critical. Former U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage urged Trump to stick to a tough line on the issue.

""Trump has got to stay tough on this and ignore all the screams coming from the liberal media,"" Farage said on ""Fox & Friends.""

Sky News reported on Wednesday that Trump is expected to meet with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle while on the visit.



“Yes, yes, I mean he has to see the head of state. Putting his foot on British soil, it's job one, it's very important, very symbolic,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. Robert Wood Johnson told Sky.

"Sen. John McCain's final journey ended Sunday on a grassy hill at the U.S. Naval Academy within view of the Severn River and earshot of midshipmen present and future, and alongside a lifelong friend.

A horse-drawn caisson carrying the senator's casket led a procession of mourners from the academy's chapel to its cemetery following a private service. The senator's widow, Cindy, and his children were among those who walked behind the caisson. Joining them were family and friends as well as members of McCain's Class of 1958 and military leaders.

The U.S. Navy band played marches along the way and several hundred Naval Academy midshipmen lined the path. A flyover of military aircraft in ""missing man"" formation honored the Navy pilot who was shot down over Vietnam and held more than five years as a prisoner of war.

After the American flag was removed from the casket, a grieving Cindy McCain pressed her check to its surface and McCain sons Jimmy and Jack shared a hug. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis presented flags to Cindy McCain and Roberta McCain, the senator's 106-year-old mother.

The burial was private as per the wishes of McCain, the Arizona Republican and 2008 presidential nominee died Aug. 25 from brain cancer at age 81.

Those offering tributes or readings during the funeral service included Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; McCain sons Jack and Douglas; retired Gen. David Petraeus, former CIA director; and Mark Salter, McCain's longtime co-author.

Petraeus said McCain was a man of ""great courage, unshakable determination, and unwavering devotion to our country and those who defend it,"" according to remarks released by the family.

Jack McCain said of his father, ""He fought hard, obstinately, exuberantly because he liked to fight, but more importantly, because he believed in what he was fighting for."" He later added, ""My father fought and suffered, endured defeats, rose from the ground and fought again to keep faith with his heroes, to safeguard the country he loved and her causes, to be a better man, and to make a better world.""

Earlier, as the hearse carrying McCain passed through a gate and into the academy, there was loud applause from the several hundred people lining the street outside on the hot and muggy summer day. Many held their hands over their hearts and waved American flags. Some shouted, ""God bless you.""

People in the crowd held signs that read ""Senator John McCain Thanks For Serving! Godspeed"" and ""Rest In Peace Maverick.""

For his final resting place, McCain picked the historic site overlooking the Severn River, not Arlington National Cemetery, where his father and grandfather, both admirals, were buried.

Years ago Chuck Larson, an admiral himself and an ally throughout McCain's life, reserved four plots at the cemetery — two for McCain and himself, and two for their wives, now widows. Larson died in 2014, and McCain wrote in a recent memoir that he wanted to be buried next to his friend, ""near where it began.""

Among the pallbearers on a list provided by McCain's office were Frank Gamboa, his academy roommate; Mattis; and two men who were POWs with McCain in Vietnam, John Fer and Everett Alvarez Jr.

Tributes to McCain began Wednesday in Arizona and continued for the remainder of the week. On Saturday, speeches by his daughter Meghan and two former presidents — Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama — remembered McCain as a patriot who could bridge painful rivalries. While their remarks made clear their admiration for him, they also represented a repudiation of President Donald Trump's brand of tough-talking, divisive politics. Trump and McCain were at odds during the 2016 campaign and for much of Trump's presidency.",politics

Israel is building a massive wall along its northern border, saying the barrier is needed to protect civilians from Hezbollah attacks, but the project has raised tensions with Lebanon, which fears the fence will encroach on its territory.

The Israeli military insists the entire barrier is being constructed in Israeli territory, and the U.N. peacekeeping force in the area agrees. But Hezbollah has never fully accepted the border, and a senior Israeli military official stressed the need for the wall, saying that while Israeli intelligence closely monitors the militant group, ""we are prepared for the possibility that they will surprise us.""

The official spoke on condition of anonymity under military guidelines during a military-led tour of the border region provided for reporters.

Israel's military conducted a large-scale combined arms drill in northern Israel this week simulating a future conflict with Hezbollah, with which it fought a monthlong war in 2006. Israelis fear there could be a renewal of hostilities as the civil war winds down in neighboring Syria, where the Iran-backed militant group has been fighting alongside President Bashar Assad's forces for the last seven years.

Hezbollah, which is considered a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel, is believed to have an even larger and more sophisticated arsenal of rockets than in 2006, when it fought Israel's vaunted military to a stalemate in southern Lebanon. That war began with a deadly cross-border raid in which Hezbollah killed eight Israeli soldiers and abducted two others, whose remains were returned to Israel in a prisoner exchange two years later.

Brig. Gen. Eran Ofir, the commander in charge of Israel's border wall projects, said around seven miles of the 80-mile (130-kilometer) barrier has been built. The $450 million project is slated for completion in two years. Most of the barrier is a concrete wall topped by steel mesh, sensors and surveillance cameras. Steel fencing replaces the concrete wall in especially rugged areas.

Earthmovers and other large machinery rumbled alongside a completed section of the 30-foot (9-meter) high concrete wall earlier this week near the Mediterranean coast. Lebanese soldiers looked over the barrier from a guard post on the opposite side of the Blue Line, which was demarcated by the U.N. after Israeli forces withdrew from south Lebanon in 2000 following an 18-year military occupation. The two countries technically remain at war.

Last month, the Lebanese army complained to UNIFIL, the U.N. peacekeeping force, saying Israeli bulldozers working on the barrier were encroaching on the Lebanese side. A Lebanese security official at the time said that following the Lebanese request, the Israeli bulldozers stopped their work and pulled back 50 meters (160 feet).

The U.N. Security Council warned last month that violations of the cease-fire agreement between Lebanon and Israel could lead to fresh conflict, and Lebanon's top security body earlier this year described the planned border wall as an ""aggression"" against its sovereignty.

""This wall, if it is built, will be considered an aggression against Lebanon,"" it said in a statement. ""The Higher Defense Council has given instructions to confront this aggression to prevent Israel from building this so-called wall barrier on Lebanese territory,"" it added.

Maj. Tomer Gilad, Israel's liaison officer with UNIFIL, said there are monthly meetings with the Lebanese military and U.N. officials to coordinate the barrier's construction.

""Even for the past year before we started this construction, we've coordinated this activity with UNIFIL, and through UNIFIL with the Lebanese Armed Forces. We've alerted them of our intention to do so, to construct this defensive mechanism,"" Gilad told reporters.

Thus far, construction has proceeded ""very calmly with the participation on all sides to maintain the stability,"" Gilad said. ""We expect UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Force to maintain stability over here throughout this construction, because this construction is a stabilizing measure.""

UNIFIL spokesman Andrea Tenenti said that since construction began in February 2018, everything has been built south of the Blue Line and away from sensitive areas.

Israel says the barrier's purpose is to defend Israeli communities from Hezbollah, pointing to sporadic cross-border attacks on Israeli troops and civilians in recent years. The volatile border between the two countries has been relatively quiet since the 2006 war, with few major cross-border attacks or incidents.

Israel warplanes, however, regularly violate Lebanese airspace, including to carry out airstrikes in neighboring Syria.

In 2010, an Israeli army officer was killed and another was seriously wounded when Israeli troops came under fire by Lebanese army forces while trimming trees on the Israeli side of the border. Three Lebanese soldiers and a Lebanese journalist were killed in Israeli retaliatory shelling. In 2013, an Israeli soldier was killed by a Lebanese army sniper while driving along the border, and in 2015 Hezbollah fired an anti-tank missile at an Israeli military convoy, killing two soldiers and wounding seven.

The Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the army has noticed a troubling rise in ""very close cooperation between Lebanese Army Forces and Hezbollah"" near the Israeli frontier in the past year. He says the military expects even more Hezbollah fighters to arrive in the area after the Syrian war ends.",world
"Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Monday expressed his approval of President Donald Trump’s handling of Russia despite the tsunami of criticism the president faced after his press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“It’s gotten so ridiculous that someone has to stand up and say we should try to engage even our adversaries and open up our lines of communication,” Paul told Politico after the controversial press conference.

“We’re going to talk to the president about some small steps in order to try to thaw the relations between our countries,” the senator added, noting that he’s set to travel to Russia early next month to continue the dialogue that Trump started.

""We’re going to talk to the president about some small steps in order to try to thaw the relations between our countries."" - Rand Paul, R-KY.

WATCH: PUTIN SITS DOWN WITH FOX NEWS

Paul said he hopes to meet with Trump before the trip to “to see if there’s anything he wants us to follow up on.” The trip, in his view, will allow the U.S. to eventually start working with Russia to stop civil war in Syria, denuclearize North Korea and get Russian military out of Ukraine.

When it came to Trump’s remarks following the one-on-one meeting, Rand broke ranks with most Republicans and criticized those slamming the president.

""Republicans that are making the criticism are either the pro-war Republicans like McCain and Graham or the anti-Trump ones like Sasse ... They are motivated by their persistent and consistent dislike of the president."" - Rand Paul, R-KY

“Republicans that are making the criticism are either the pro-war Republicans like (Sen. John) McCain and (Sen. Lindsey) Graham or the anti-Trump ones like (Sen. Ben) Sasse,” he told Politico. “They are motivated by their persistent and consistent dislike of the president.”

Trump later tweeted: ""Thank you @RandPaul, you really get it!""

Trump drew fury from Republicans after saying both Russia and the U.S. are to blame for strained relations and by not standing behind the U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections.

Trump said he has great confidence in the intelligence community, but Putin gave a “strong and powerful” denial. He said he doesn't “see any reason why” Russia would be behind election meddling.

“There is no question that Russia interfered in our election and continues attempts to undermine democracy here and around the world,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said shortly after the press conference in Helsinki, Finland.

SCHOEN: PUTIN ATE TRUMP'S LUNCH

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called Trump’s performance “disgraceful” and issued a lengthy statement criticizing the president for kowtowing to the Russian president.

“President Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to stand up to Putin. He and Putin seemed to be speaking from the same script as the president made a conscious choice to defend a tyrant against the fair questions of a free press, and to grant Putin an uncontested platform to spew propaganda and lies to the world,” McCain in a statement, calling the president’s comments at the press conference “a recent low point in the history of the American Presidency.”

But it’s no surprise that Rand, and a handful of other Republican lawmakers, are embracing Trump’s approach to Russia. Last year, the senator from Kentucky voted against a sanctions bill against Russia.

As a libertarian-leaning Republican, he also long opposed the hawks – like national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo – in the Trump administration, who in his view, seek confrontation rather than dialogue.

“We have a lot of areas ... we should be talking about,” Paul told Politico about Russia. “We won’t get anywhere on it if we just say we want ... to put more sanctions on them and tomorrow they’ll surrender and do what we want.”

"Charles Krauthammer, the beloved and brilliant Fox News Channel personality who gave up a pioneering career in psychiatry to become a Pulitzer Prize-winning political analyst, on Friday revealed the heartbreaking news that he is in the final stages of a losing battle with cancer.

The 68-year-old’s incisive takes on politics of the day have been missing from Fox News Channel’s “Special Report” for nearly a year as he battled an abdominal tumor and subsequent complications, but colleagues and viewers alike had held out hope that he would return to the evening show he helped establish as must-viewing. But in an eloquent, yet unblinking letter to co-workers, friends and Fox News Channel viewers, Krauthammer disclosed that he has just weeks to live.

“I have been uncharacteristically silent these past ten months,” the letter began. “I had thought that silence would soon be coming to an end, but I’m afraid I must tell you now that fate has decided on a different course for me.”

""This is the final verdict. My fight is over.” - Charles Krauthammer

Krauthammer, who graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1975 despite a first-year diving accident that left him a quadriplegic, explained that he had a malignant tumor removed from his abdomen last August. Although a series of setbacks left him in the hospital in the ensuing months, he believed until recently that he was on the road to recovery.

“However, recent tests have revealed that the cancer has returned,” Krauthammer wrote. “There was no sign of it as recently as a month ago, which means it is aggressive and spreading rapidly. My doctors tell me their best estimate is that I have only a few weeks left to live. This is the final verdict. My fight is over.”

Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of Fox News and its parent company, 21st Century Fox, said Krauthammer has been a giant of journalism and a key part of the channel's success.

""Charles has been a profound source of personal and intellectual inspiration for all of us at Fox News,"" Murdoch said. ""His always principled stand on the most important issues of our time has been a guiding star in an often turbulent world, a world that has too many superficial thinkers vulnerable to the ebb and flow of fashion, and a world that, unfortunately, has only one Charles Krauthammer.

""His words, his ideas, his dignity and his integrity will resonate within our society and within me for many, many years to come,"" Murdoch added.

Fox News viewers will undoubtedly miss Krauthammer’s formidable intellect and ability to analyze politics and politicians with a cerebral wit and keen charm. As the dean of “The Fox News All Stars,” the panel of pundits who break down headlines and events nightly on Fox News Channel’s top-rated “Special Report,” Krauthammer could be counted on to make viewers think, question and even chuckle.

Krauthammer was on his way to greatness in the medical field when he veered first into policy, and then into journalism. After medical school, he became chief psychiatry resident at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he studied depression and published ground-breaking findings in top medical journals. But in 1978, he took a job in the Carter administration directing planning in psychiatric research and later served as a speech writer for Vice President Walter Mondale.

It was in the nation’s capital that Krauthammer trained his mind and talents on political analysis and began penning columns for The New Republic, Time magazine and finally the Washington Post. In 1985, he won journalism’s top prize for his weekly political commentary. In his sobering farewell, Krauthammer said he is “grateful to have played a small role in the conversations that have helped guide this extraordinary nation’s destiny.”

“I leave this life with no regrets,” Krauthammer wrote. “It was a wonderful life – full and complete with the great loves and great endeavors that make it worth living. I am sad to leave, but I leave with the knowledge that I lived the life that I intended.”",politics
"After days of being dressed down by the judge overseeing the Paul Manafort case, federal prosecutors sought Thursday to put their foot down -- filing a motion complaining that Judge T.S. Ellis III had unfairly admonished them in front of the jury.

Ellis has memorably and repeatedly criticized Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team during the trial for the former Trump campaign chairman. On Wednesday, Ellis ripped into prosecutors for letting a witness, IRS Agent Michael Welsh, sit in the courtroom before his testimony.

But in a five-page motion filed Thursday, Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann and other attorneys on the team claimed Ellis had actually granted permission earlier in the trial for the witness to remain in the room during proceedings.

“The court’s reprimand of government counsel suggested to the jury—incorrectly—that the government had acted improperly and in contravention of court rules,” the prosecutors wrote. “This prejudice should be cured.”

Ellis responded by expressing regret in court Thursday.

“This robe doesn’t make me anything other than human,” Ellis said.

Referencing his earlier reprimand, Ellis said Thursday: “Any criticism of counsel should be put aside.”

The truce between the judge and prosecutors, though, did not last long.

Hours later, when prosecutors tried to introduce an exhibit that was dozens of pages long, Ellis interjected: ""There might be some kind soul on the jury who thinks they need to leaf through all this stuff -- and it isn't true.""

The Mueller team relented and only entered 11 pages into evidence.

Ellis has a reputation for making colorful comments – and being tough on the prosecution.

On Wednesday, Ellis explained that he would not ask the defense to reveal as much information as he has demanded from the prosecution because “it’s sort of like poker -- you don’t have to show your hand until you’re called.”

“Something like that, I’m not a poker player,” Ellis said.

MANAFORT TRIAL JUDGE TS ELLIS TAUNTS AND TORMENTS MUELLER TEAM

Earlier this week, Ellis seemed to accuse Greg Andres, the prosecutor, of crying in his courtroom.

“I understand how frustrated you are. In fact, there’s tears in your eyes right now,” Ellis said Monday, according to a Bloomberg-obtained transcript.

When Andres denied Ellis’ claim, the judge said, “Well, they’re watery.”

And on Wednesday, Ellis chastised Andres again for how he speaks to him. At one point, Andres responded with a simple “yea.”

“Be careful about that, this is not an informal proceeding,” Ellis warned.

Manafort is accused of committing tax and bank fraud with millions made through political work in Ukraine. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Earlier this week, the prosecution’s star witness, Rick Gates – who struck a plea deal to cooperate with the government -- testified that he and Manafort committed bank and tax fraud together.

On Thursday, prosecutors attempted to prove Manafort committed bank fraud by calling witnesses to describe a rental property he owned.

One witness from AirBNB testified that one of Manafort's properties was available for rent on the site and someone paid more than $11,000 to stay there for 21 days.

RICK GATES ADMITS EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIR IN LONDON

But prosecutors say that property was listed on papers as a second home, and not as a rental property, something that would impact whether or not a bank would have agreed to loan him more than $5 million.

Prosecutors also brought up a mortgage processor from Citizens Bank to show that Manafort had many opportunities to say it was a rental property for tax purposes but didn't.

"In the five weeks since President Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court, we have seen Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., take obstruction and hyper-partisanship to new heights.

Immediately following the president’s July 9 nomination of Kavanaugh – a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia – Schumer vowed that he would oppose the nomination “with everything I’ve got.” If the weeks since are any indication, we should believe him.

Schumer has gone so far as to refuse to meet with Kavanaugh, and to encourage other Senate Democrats to also refuse to meet with the judge.

It is customary for the Senate leadership of both political parties to meet with a president’s nominee. In 2010, then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., met with Elena Kagan the very first day she was on Capitol Hill, just two days after her nomination to the Supreme Court was announced by President Obama.

Likewise, Sonia Sotomayor met with nearly every senator of both parties the summer leading up to her confirmation as a justice on the high court.

To his credit, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., broke ranks with his party to sit down with Kavanaugh on July 30, calling the two-hour meeting “very productive.”

Shortly after Manchin announced that he would meet with Kavanaugh, Sens. Joe Donnelly D-Ind., and Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., also scheduled meetings with the nominee. Those meetings took place Wednesday when the Senate returned from its abbreviated summer recess.

In the face of these defections, even Schumer himself finally agreed to meet with Kavanaugh later this month.

Manchin, Donnelly, and Heitkamp were the only three Senate Democrats who voted for Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to the Supreme Court last year. Yet all three senators are carefully toeing the fallback line set by Schumer to remain noncommittal about Kavanaugh, to give Schumer room to maneuver. Manchin has said that he plans to meet with Kavanaugh again after the judge’s Senate confirmation his hearing.

After Donnelly met with Kavanaugh he issued a statement saying that he “will continue a thorough review of Judge Kavanaugh’s record” and will to follow the judge’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing closely.

Donnelly added: “I plan to keep doing my homework and make a decision sometime after Kavanaugh’s committee confirmation hearing.”

Heitkamp was also circumspect, only saying that she will “continue reviewing his record” and “closely study his answers at his Senate hearing” after she met with Kavanaugh.

Schumer’s dogged opposition to Kavanaugh has put the three senators in a tight spot. A recent poll conducted by North Star Opinion Research shows that in Indiana, Hoosiers favor Kavanaugh’s confirmation 52 to 34 percent. In North Dakota, the margin is even greater, with 60 percent of people supporting Kavanaugh’s confirmation, and only 22 percent opposing.

The numbers hold strong for those who self-identify as independents: In Indiana, 48 percent of independents favor confirmation of Kavanaugh, versus 34 percent who oppose. In North Dakota, 60 percent of independents want to see Kavanaugh confirmed versus 18 percent who don’t.

Donnelly and Heitkamp find themselves at a crossroads now that they have met with Kavanaugh. Their constituents strongly favor the judge’s confirmation and recognize that critical issues are at stake with the appointment of the next justice to the Supreme Court.

People in both states care about preserving our nation’s constitutional structure and the framers’ respect for separation of powers. They desire checks on the power of the federal government, such as the protection of their Second Amendment rights. They want to enforce constitutional limits on the federal agencies that oversee an ever-more burdensome regulatory state.

This week (and later next month, when they make the decision to vote for or against Kavanaugh), Donnelly and Heitkamp have the chance to prove that they are not beholden to the obstructionist liberal leadership of their party, but rather are true representatives of the interests of their respective states.

"Top law enforcement officials have countered a claim by Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson that Russian operatives had penetrated some county election systems in his home state of Florida.

In a Monday letter obtained by Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and FBI Director Christopher Wray told Florida officials that while Russian spies “have previously demonstrated both the intent and capability to conduct malicious cyber operations,” there is no current evidence to suggest any meddling in the upcoming midterm elections in November.

“DHS and the FBI will continue to notify any victim of a successful cyber intrusion into their election network in any jurisdiction nationwide,” the letter, which was first reported by the Orlando Sentinel, stated.

The letter is the latest blow to Nelson's claims. It comes after Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner sent letters to the DHS, FBI and congressional leaders inquiring about the senator's assertions.

Nelson made the unsubstantiated claim earlier this month. He said Russian agents “have already penetrated certain counties in the state and they now have free rein to move about.” He added that voting machines in Florida have already been compromised by Russian meddling.

The senator’s claim drew quick retorts from a number of prominent Republicans, including Florida Gov. Rick Scott who is challenging Nelson for his Senate seat. Scott demanded that the three-term Democratic incumbent provide proof of his claim and raised the concern that Nelson may have revealed classified information.

""Until the essential question is answered – was Nelson revealing classified information or did he make this up – until that answer is clearly marked out by the senator, I think that these questions are not going away,"" Lauren Schenone, the press secretary for Scott's campaign, told The Hill.

Nelson, and fellow Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote to election officials back in July warning about potential threats to their state’s election apparatus. Nelson and Rubio suggested that 2018 would be a year that demands “greater awareness of cyber threats,” and encouraged state officials to take advantage of the “wide range of services” provided by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to safeguard against such intrusion.

Despite the criticism from Scott and other Republicans, Nelson has refused to back down from his comments.

During stops in north Florida over a two-day period last week, Nelson said state and local officials need to take Russian meddling as a ""serious threat"" and county election supervisors need to make sure they have help to protect their election systems. Russian hackers targeted at least 21 states, including Florida, during the last election.

""It would be foolish to think that the Russians are not continuing to do what they did in Florida in 2016,"" Nelson said. ""It is unfortunate that some Florida officials are trying to use this for partisan purposes.""

"President Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Sunday slammed Trump’s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, after he pleaded guilty last week to federal charges and implicating the president in a crime.

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Lewandowski sought to distance Trump from his former attorney and denied that Cohen played any significant role in Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.

""Michael was very good at certain things and one of the things he was very good at, and we have now seen it, is intimidating people,"" Lewandowski responded.

""I didn't like to work with Michael, I didn't like to interact with Michael, and that's why he had no role in the campaign, even when he wanted one,"" he added. ""I was very clear when I was in charge of the campaign, Michael was not somebody who we wanted at the campaign. He would go out and make statements that we had to walk back afterwards because he would say things which were factually untrue. I warned everybody at the organization that Michael was going to become a problem.""

Cohen pleaded guilty on Tuesday to tax evasion, campaign finance violations and bank fraud.

Cohen, who once said he would ""take a bullet"" for Trump, commented in court Tuesday that Trump had directed him to arrange payments of $130,000 to porn actress Stormy Daniels and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to buy their silence about alleged affairs before the election.

While Trump denies the affairs, his account of his knowledge of the payments has shifted. In April, Trump denied he knew anything about the Daniels payment. He told Fox News in an interview aired Thursday that he knew about payments ""later on.""

"A 24-year-old woman celebrating her birthday was among the three people reportedly killed by gang members outside her party late Saturday night in Brazil.

Eliana Ferreira Campos, a suspected gang member, was hosting her birthday party at a home in the municipality of Ji-Parana, about 1,926 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, when she was attacked.

Surveillance footage from outside the party shows Ferreira Campos chatting with friends when she was approached by a group of people who began physically attacking her. Amid the scuffle, one person took out a gun and fatally shot her, local news outlets reported.

Local news outlet Comando 190, citing police, said Ferreira Campos was struck in the forehead, chest and the back of the head. Two of the attackers fled the scene on a stolen motorcycle, police said.

Two other people, identified later as Paloma de Oliveira Guimaraes, 26, and Edmundo Cristian Ferreira de Matos, 18, were also killed at the scene.

WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO

RH 24 Horas reported the deadly incident happened “due to the war between the criminal factions Red Command and First Command of the Capital.”

According to Comando 190, Ferreira Campos was a member of Red Command and went by the name “Miss Barbye Marley.”

Police arrested three people in connection to the fatal incident: 22-year-old Ray de Souza Silva aka “Baleado;” 25-year-old Fernando Ferreira da Silva, aka “Furunco;” and 22-year-old Gustavo Pereira Cabral, commonly known as “Brizola.” All three are believed to be gang members with First Command of the Capital.

Local news outlets reported witnesses told police the gunmen arrived at the party in a silver-colored vehicle and that a person had followed the vehicle to a nearby supermarket. Police eventually arrested Pereira, who reportedly had cell phone videos that confirmed he participated in the incident.

Souza Silva and Ferreira da Silva were stopped by police at a nearby town.

Police said de Souza Silva told authorities that he felt no remorse for the crime and that they had planned to kill more people at the birthday party.

“I’m not sorry at all … because if I do not kill them, they’re the ones who kill me because we’re at war,” he reportedly police, according to RH 24 horas.

Brazil has long been the world leader in overall homicide numbers, and its homicide rate is also one of the world’s highest. According to a report released Thursday, a record 63,880 people were slain in the South American country last year.

The report counted an average of 14 deaths a day at the hands of police officers, which it said was a 20 percent increase over last year.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has voided an amnesty given to a former rebel military officer and ordered the arrest of the man who as a senator has been one of the controversial leader's fiercest critics.

Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV spoke Tuesday in the Senate to condemn Duterte's move against him as illegal and draconian but added he won't resist arrest. After being advised that Senate leaders won't allow his arrest in the building, Trillanes said he would heed their advice and stay within the Senate in a looming standoff.

""We're living basically in a de facto martial law environment of the '70s kind,"" Trillanes told a throng of journalists and followers, referring to the martial law declared by dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, which is regarded as a dark chapter in Philippine democracy.

Some opposition politicians started trooping to the Senate to show support to Trillanes, a 47-year-old former navy officer, who had been detained for several years before his election to the Senate for his involvement in at least three military uprisings from 2003 to 2007 to protest official corruption.

Trillanes received an amnesty during the time of Duterte's predecessor, President Benigno Aquino III. Several young military officers who were detained for joining the failed coup attempts and uprisings against the administration of Aquino's predecessor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, benefited under the amnesty program, but only Trillanes' amnesty has been voided so far.

Trillanes said his lawyers would file petitions to the Supreme Court ""to resolve this madness of Duterte"" and the government's solicitor-general and fight what he said amounted to a warrantless arrest.

""They're bending the law to be able to do their political objective, which is to persecute the political opposition,"" Trillanes said.

Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra told a separate news conference that Duterte signed a proclamation last week voiding the 2011 amnesty given to Trillanes because the senator failed to comply with all the amnesty requirements, including a clear admission of his involvement in past coup attempts.

Law enforcers can comply with Duterte's order to arrest Trillanes anytime because the senator cannot invoke his immunity from such arrests because the crimes he supposedly committed, including rebellion, were serious and are punishable by life imprisonment.

Opposition Sen. Franklin Drilon said all rebellion and coup-related cases against Trillanes were dismissed by a court after he was amnestied. Duterte's administration could not renew those cases against the senator because that would amount to a ""double jeopardy"" that's forbidden under Philippine law.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque, who is accompanying Duterte in a visit to Israel, denied that the move against Trillanes was political persecution, saying the government was just enforcing the law. He said the government would exercise maximum tolerance in case protests erupt.

Duterte has openly expressed his anger against Trillanes, who has accused him of large-scale corruption and involvement in illegal drugs, allegations the volatile president has repeatedly denied. He has been hyper-sensitive to criticism, especially concerning his deadly crackdown on illegal drugs, and once told President Barack Obama to ""go to hell"" after Obama raised concerns over the drug killings.

Aside from Trillanes, a fellow opposition senator, Leila de Lima, has been detained after being accused by Duterte of involvement in illegal drugs, a crime she has vehemently denied. De Lima, a former human rights commission chief, investigated allegations of Duterte's links to extrajudicial killings of drug suspects when Duterte was still mayor of southern Davao city.

Duterte, now 73, said those past investigations did not turn up any evidence against him. De Lima and other former human rights officials said witnesses were terrified of testifying against Duterte in Davao because of the many killings of drug suspects when Duterte served for years as Davao's mayor.

Another Duterte critic, Maria Lourdes Sereno, was ousted by fellow magistrates in the Supreme Court in May after the government alleged that her appointment by Duterte's predecessor was legally flawed and petitioned her removal in an unprecedented move that Sereno called political persecution.",world
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took to Twitter Monday to poke fun at protesters who confronted him over the weekend, saying “they waited until” his wife -- Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao -- “wasn’t around.”

McConnell’s “Team Mitch” Twitter account retweeted an article by The Hill that showed a group of protesters shouting at the Kentucky lawmaker as he left the Bristol Bar & Grille in Louisville on Saturday.

Demonstrators were heard yelling “abolish ICE” and “no justice, no peace.” McConnell could be seen in the video walking to his car unfazed.

“I see what they did here. They waited until Elaine wasn’t around,” the tweet that accompanied the article read. The tweet was signed “-MM.”

He also included the hashtag “#dontleavehomewithouther.”

McConnell seemed to be referencing an incident last month outside an event at Georgetown University where protesters confronted McConnell and Chao.

“How do you sleep at night?” one protester shouted.

“You leave my husband alone!,” Chao responded.

Father Jacque Lacroix, 89, a priest who belonged to the Meaux Diocese, became a viral sensation after a YouTube video showed him giving a baby a slap on the cheek. The video, which has been viewed more than 5 million times, sparked backlash from viewers.

The diocese released a statement on Friday regarding the viral video, saying that Lacroix has been suspended.

“This short video is an excerpt from the celebration during which the baby cries a lot. The elderly priest loses his temper and slaps the child. Aware of this inappropriate gesture, the priest apologized to the family at the end of the baptism,” the statement read.

The diocese then announced that Lacroix was “suspended from all baptism and marriage celebrations.”

“On Friday, June 22, Bishop Nahmias, Bishop of Meaux, took provisional measures to ensure that the priest was suspended from all baptism and marriage celebrations. These measures also require him not to intervene on the Collegiate Church of Champeaux now and to celebrate masses only at the express request of the parish priest,” the statement concluded.

"Republican House members could be days away from the release of article of impeachment against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, sources told Fox News on Monday.

Sources said there could be two separate resolutions to impeach Rosenstein but there is hope among some members of Congress to vote on the issue prior to the House’s August recess.

The deputy attorney general oversees Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia.

Politico reported last week that Reps. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, both members of the House Freedom Caucus, are leading the effort.

Politico’s story on the possible impeachment filing against Rosenstein came on the same day that Rosenstein announced Mueller’s 12 indictments against Russian military intelligence officials on charges linked to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Speculation that President Donald Trump might fire Rosenstein increased in April, after FBI agents conducted raids at the office and home of Michael Cohen, the president’s former personal attorney, the Hill reported.

The 29-page indictment lays out how, months before Americans went to the polls, Russians schemed to break into key Democratic email accounts, including those belonging to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Stolen emails, many politically damaging for Clinton, appeared on WikiLeaks in the campaign's final stretch.

Rosenstein called for a unified approach to countering foreign meddling.

""When we confront foreign interference in American elections, it is important for us to avoid thinking politically as Republicans or Democrats and instead to think patriotically as Americans,"" he said. ""Our response must not depend on who was victimized.""

"A top navy general in Iranian said Monday the country took full control of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping route that the Iranians threatened to block in the past amid worsening American-Iranian relations.

The Tasnim news agency reported the announcement by the head of the Revolutionary Guards navy, General Alireza Tangsiri, according to Reuters.

The Strait of Hormuz has long been the target of the Iranians as it’s a major shipping route where around 20 per cent of oil traded worldwide passes through the waterway.

The Iranian officials recently threatened to block the waterway in retaliation for any hostile action by the U.S. government amid President Trump’s remarks in July, which were prompted by the Iranian President Rouhani saying the U.S. risks the “mother of all wars"" with Iran.

Trump called for Rouhani to stop the rhetoric or – in caps lock – “suffer the consequences the like of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence and death. Be cautious!”

The comment prompted Iran to undergo a major naval exercise near the passage earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported.

There were more than 100 boats and ships participating in the military drill in a bid to send a message to the U.S. that Iranians can simply close down the passage, said U.S. officials.

According to Reuters, U.S. officials aim to economically isolate Iran and reduce its oil exports – one of the few regime-saving industries – to zero.

"President Trump threw in the towel Friday with a tweet telling Republicans in Congress to ""stop wasting their time"" on immigration legislation until after the November elections. He said that next year they should try again to overcome their internal disputes on the issue.

The reason for the president’s reversal was those elections. Polls show the GOP electorate is split on immigration. Even among Republicans over the age of 50, over 40 percent oppose President Trump’s actions on family separation.

Control of the House of Representatives will be determined by election results in suburban congressional districts with large numbers of highly educated voters that are now represented by Republicans. With some exceptions, such as in Minnesota, the key races that will determine which party wins a House majority will not be fought in the blue-collar, populist districts that swung from Barack Obama to Donald Trump in 2016.

The generic vote for Congress is close. A tough policy on immigration may bring out President Trump’s base to vote, but the public relations disaster of family separations threatened to drive suburban voters – especially women – to the Democrats.

“Somehow I don’t think that putting kids in cages is likely to go over very well with suburban moms,” Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, told The Atlantic magazine.

Trump aides hope that by now combining tough rhetoric on issues such as sanctuary cities with ducking a bruising political battle in Congress, they will thread the needle and allow Republicans to keep the House.

Two new polls indicate that immigration may not be quite the potent issue it was for Trump in 2016. Ironically, the surging economy has lowered the number of people trying to cross the border or overstay their visas.

A new Gallup poll finds that only 29 percent of Americans think legal immigration should be reduced. A plurality of 39 percent think it should stay at current levels, while 28 percent want immigration increased. A large majority favor allowing “Dreamers” who came to the U.S. as children and are now protected by the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program to remain in the country.

Republicans have learned that without a fully thought out strategy, immigration can boomerang as an issue.

In last year’s Virginia governor’s race, Republican Ed Gillespie backed President Trump and ran commercials in northern Virginia touting the need to crush MS-13, a gang with ties to Central America that had made inroads in the area. But the northern Virginia counties swung away from Gillespie, as suburban voters indicated they had other priorities.

In Loudoun County, Gillespie won only 39 percent of the vote, barely edging Trump’s 2016 showing. Only five years earlier, Mitt Romney had won 47 percent in Loudoun.

President Trump makes some strong points on the need to restore the rule of law in our approach to border enforcement, especially given that many Democrats appear to have largely moved towards a position where they barely support the notion of a border at all.

But sometimes it’s best to live to fight another day. President Trump made a hash of his family separation policy in much the same way he mishandled the travel ban that he declared in his administration’s first week in office. An understaffed White House came up with a family separation plan that wasn’t fully thought through and wasn’t run by relevant officials in the Cabinet departments. When it came under fire, the Trump White House ended up with a surreal 14 different explanations for its actions.

It’s no wonder that Rep. Mike Coffman, a conservative Republican representing the Denver suburbs, has tweeted: “The President should put a General, a respected retired CEO or some other senior leadership figure on the job of making sure each and every child is returned to their parents. ... This is a human rights mess. It is on the President to clean it up and fire the people responsible for making it.”

The Washington Post reported in May that Taylor, a student at Catonsville Middle School, is a “sixth-grader with strong beliefs about racial injustice, sexism, gay rights and President Trump’s proposed wall at the Mexico border.”

According to the Post, Taylor says she was reprimanded by her teacher, leading to the involvement of her parents as well as the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland. However, her school has said she wasn’t punished for her actions.

Clinton, with her tweet, was doing more than weighing in on a local school dispute. Speaking in support of kneeling puts her at odds with her political nemisis and 2016 foe, President Trump, who has waged a war of words against football players who kneel during the national anthem.

She also weighed in last year, when promoting her campaign post-mortem “What Happened.”

"Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election is ongoing – and secret.

So far, four former Trump campaign associates – Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Richard Gates and George Papadopoulos – have been charged, though none of the charges are directly related to any misconduct by the president's campaign. Of the four, only Manafort has been found guilty by a jury in part of Mueller’s probe.

Alex van der Zwaan, an attorney, pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators during the investigation, and was sentenced to 30 days in prison in April 2018. He was the first to be sentenced in the probe.

The special counsel filed new tax evasion and bank fraud charges against Manafort and Gates in late February, potentially increasing the amount of prison time the pair could face if convicted at trial. The charges are similar to those filed in October.

Here's a closer look at those who have faced charges throughout Mueller's probe.

Michael Flynn

Michael Flynn, who served as Trump’s national security adviser for less than a month before resigning, was charged and pleaded guilty in December 2017 to making false statements to the FBI.

Flynn reportedly lied about his talks with Russia's ambassador to Washington. In late 2016, while former President Barack Obama was still in office, the two allegedly spoke about the U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia.

This raised concerns that Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, misled Trump officials about his conversations with Russian officials.

Paul Manafort

The special counsel filed a 32-count indictment on Feb. 22 against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and aide Rick Gates, accusing the pair of tax evasion and bank fraud.

The new indictment accused Manafort and Gates of doctoring documents to inflate the income of their businesses and then using those fraudulent documents to obtain loans. It also accused Manafort of evading taxes from 2010 through 2014 and, in some of the years, concealing his foreign bank accounts.

And on Feb. 23, a newly unsealed indictment accused Manafort of secretly paying former European politicians to lobby on behalf of Ukraine.

Manafort turned himself in to federal authorities in the fall. The 69-year-old served as Trump’s campaign manager for a few months in 2016. Gates, Manafort's business associate, also turned himself in at the time.

Manafort was initially charged in a 12-count indictment in connection with foreign lobbying work, and he pleaded not guilty. The charges included: conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, false statements, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, and multiple counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts, according to a special counsel's office spokesman.

In June 2018, Mueller's team brought additional charges of obstruction of justice against Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik, an associate.

Manafort sued to have the case against him dismissed and argued that Mueller had overstepped his bounds by charging him for conduct he says is unrelated to Russian interference in the 2016 election.

On June 15, however, Manafort was jailed after a federal judge revoked his $10 million bail based on new witness tampering charges brought by Mueller.

Manafort was found guilty of eight financial crimes on Aug. 21 in the first trial victory of the special counsel investigation into the president's associates. A judge declared a mistrial on 10 other counts the jury could not agree on.

Richard Gates

Rick Gates was named alongside Manafort in the recent charges brought by the special counsel. He's accused of 11 counts related to filing false income tax returns and three counts of failure to report foreign bank and financial accounts.

Gates pleaded guilty on Feb. 23 to federal conspiracy and false-statements charges.

In wake of the guilty plea, Mueller moved to drop the 22 bank and tax fraud charges against him. The decision to drop the more expansive charges against Gates could suggest that the former Trump campaign official is cooperating and providing good information to Mueller's team.

Like Manafort, Gates was initially indicted in October in connection with foreign lobbying work; he pleaded not guilty at the time. His charges were similar to Manafort’s – ranging from conspiracy against the U.S. to conspiracy to launder money.

A superseding criminal complaint says Gates was charged with conspiracy against the United States between 2006 and 2017.

George Papadopoulos

A former foreign policy adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign, George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in 2017 to making false statements to the FBI regarding “the timing, extent and nature of his relationships and interactions with certain foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior Russian government officials,” according to court documents.

He also reportedly tried to set up meetings between Russian and Trump campaign officials on various occasions.

Alex van der Zwaan

Mueller's team charged Dutch attorney Alex van der Zwaan for lying to federal investigators in the Russia probe in federal court on Feb. 16. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 days in prison and given a $20,000 fine on April 3.

Van der Zwaan was released from prison on June 4 and turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.

According to charging documents, van der Zwaan was employed by a law firm hired by the Ukraine Ministry of Justice in 2012. He admitted to lying about his interactions with Gates.

The charge against van der Zwaan did not involve election meddling or the Trump campaign's operations. It stemmed from the special counsel's investigation into a covert Washington lobbying campaign Manafort and Gates are accused of directing on behalf of pro-Russian Ukrainian interests.

The law firm where he used to work says it fired him last year and will continue cooperating with authorities as needed.

Richard Pinedo

Richard Pinedo, a California man who sold bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election, pleaded guilty to using stolen identities to set up the bank accounts in February.

The U.S. government said Pinedo did not know that he was dealing with Russians when he sold the accounts. The plea was announced on the same day that Mueller’s office charged 13 Russians and the indictment was the most direct allegation to date of illegal Russian meddling during the campaign.

Pinedo ran the online service Auction Essistance, buying and selling bank account numbers so customers could avoid security measures of digital payment companies, Newsweek reported. The Auction Essistance website says it is “currently undergoing scheduled maintenance.”

13 Russian nationals

A grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election. In the case, Mueller details a sophisticated plot to wage “information warfare” on the U.S.

The indictment is the first to be brought against Russian nationals in Mueller's investigation.

However, the Justice Department said the indictment does not allege that the interference changed the outcome of the election.

""There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity,"" said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel probe.

12 Russian intelligence officers

The Justice Department on July 13 announced that 12 Russian intelligence officers were indicted for allegedly hacking the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign during the 2016 election.

All 12 are members of GRU, the Russian intelligence agency.

The indictments, which stem from the Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, were announced by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

In April, his campaign raised $450,000, with more than half of that coming from Soros in the form of a contribution to Forward Florida, a political action committee focused on getting Gillum elected, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

Both Soros and Steyer, who’s been leading an effort to impeach President Trump, also directed $650,000 in the final two weeks of primary campaigning toward the same political group, according to Politico.

Before the last-minute cash infusion, Steyer reportedly had already donated $500,000 to groups supporting Gillum, while Soros’ total contributions to the pro-Gillum group stood at $1 million.

Despite the donations and criticism that the billionaires may have undue influence in politics, Gillum brushed off suggestions that his candidacy was bankrolled by billionaires, saying the campaign was led by donations from “everyday folks.”

“[O]ur campaign was really propped up by a lot of small contributions, including my mother, who was on auto-deduct of $20 a month into our campaign,” Gillum said on the show. “In the first two days of this general election, our campaign has been buoyed this first week, raising over $2 million by everyday folks, not big contributions, but everyday folks sowing a seed into our race.”

"Two years into the Trump administration, aggrieved activists are not only accosting Cabinet members or driving them out of restaurants -- they're increasingly taking out their frustration on inanimate objects.

A burst of anti-Trump vandalism against possessions and property associated with administration officials is the latest flare-up in a “resistance” that has taken many forms.

Last year, protesters marked the anniversary of President Trump's election by screaming at the sky. Lately, the tactics have become more confrontational, touching off a national debate over civility in politics.

But smashing and spray-painting are yet another outlet. Here are some of the items that have been the focus of anti-Trump activists’ rage.

Trump’s Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame



Trump’s star on the Walk of Fame has been subjected to repeat acts of vandalism, with one protester going so far as to smash it with a pick ax last month.

Brawls have since broken out at the spot after crowds of Trump supporters and protesters gathered near the contentious marker.

But this isn’t the first time the star has been under assault. Back in 2016, before Trump was elected, the star was defaced by a vandal who scratched off his name and a TV icon. The vandal told TMZ he was doing it so that the removed parts could be auctioned for the legal defense of Trump accusers.

Earlier that year, the star was defaced in February of 2016 when someone spray-painted it with a swastika.



Betsy DeVos’ Yacht



A $40 million boat owned by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was untied from its Ohio dock last week, causing it to drift into a dock and incur up to $10,000 in damages. The vessel, named the Seaquest, ended up with large scratches before the crew was able to get control of it.

DeVos is unlikely to be too troubled by the damage -- the Seaquest is one of 10 vessels owned by the DeVos family.



Ben Carson’s House



Ben Carson, the Housing and Urban Development secretary, said in a Facebook post last August that his home in Virginia, along with his neighbor’s house, was vandalized by anti-Trump types who “wrote hateful rhetoric about President Trump.”



“We were out of town, but other kind, embarrassed neighbors cleaned up most of the mess before we returned,” Carson said.



Trump Golf Courses



Of all the officials in the Trump administration, President Trump will always be the main villain in the eyes of his opponents. This, in turn, makes his properties a prime target.



The Trump International Golf Course near his Florida estate was hit by splotches of red paint in April, obscuring some of the letters on the sign at the entrance of the club in West Palm Beach.

In October, a Hawaii man reportedly was charged with criminal mischief for defacing four golf courses owned by the Trump Organization, by allegedly carving messages into the greens.

Trump International Hotel

In October 2016, Trump's hotel in downtown Washington D.C. was vandalized with the phrases ""black lives matter"" and ""no justice, no peace.""

In May 2017, the same hotel briefly had messages in light projected onto the hotel, including one that said ""Pay Trump Bribes Here."" Another read ""emoluments welcome,"" in reference to the controversy surrounding Trump's alleged financial conflicts.

Trump Paraphernalia

Make America Great Again? Well, don't declare it too loudly, as there have been multiple reports of Trump supporters being accosted for wearing a MAGA cap, or other signs of Trump support.

Just this week, a woman in Massachusetts was taken into custody after allegedly deliberately ramming into a car sporting a Trump bumper sticker.

“She said, ‘You voted for Trump?’” the man she hit recalled her saying. “I said yes. She called me a racist and several other names.” The man then claimed that the woman repositioned her vehicle and hit his car with hers, the Cape Cod Times said, citing the police report. After this, the woman reportedly left the scene.

"Second Amendment activists were given a surprise boost this week when the liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals backed a lower court’s decision to suspend California’s ban on the possession of large magazines.



Activists, supported by the National Rifle Association, have argued that the state's ban on ownership of magazines holding 10 bullets or more is unconstitutional. They won a preliminary injunction by a San Diego district court last year, and a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit backed that injunction Tuesday.



The court found that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the injunction or by concluding that magazines fall within the scope of the Second Amendment.

""The district court did not abuse its discretion by applying the incorrect level of scrutiny,"" the judges also found. ""The district court concluded that a ban on ammunition magazines is not a presumptively lawful regulation and that the prohibition did not have a 'historical pedigree.'""

“This is a significant win for law-abiding gun owners in California,” Chris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement. “This unconstitutional law criminalizes mere possession of many standard capacity magazines and would instantly turn many law-abiding gun owners into criminals.”

Dissenting from the ruling, Judge John Clifford Wallace said that evidence provided by the state, including studies and surveys showing the use of large-capacity magazines increase the lethality of gun violence, “was more than sufficient to satisfy intermediate scrutiny.”

National Review’s David French, who opposes the ban, noted that the Ninth Circuit ruling was limited but also linked constitutional protection of firearms to potential militia use -- a development he described as “encouraging.”

The NRA noted that a ruling in the lower courts is expected soon, and that the case therefore will likely be before the 9th Circuit again.



But President Trump has nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has a strong record of defending gun rights, to the Supreme Court. The NRA reflected that in its statement, expressing hope that if the the case is appealed, “the Supreme Court will likely have a new justice who respects the right to keep and bear arms as protected by the Second Amendment.”



The California Department of Justice told The San Diego Union-Tribune that it will “continue to vigorously defend the challenged law.”

Based in San Francisco, the Ninth Circuit has a reputation for being one of the nation's most liberal courts. Critics have branded the court the “Nutty 9th” or the “9th Circus,” in part because many of its rulings have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. This includes an infamous 2002 ruling that the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional because of its use of the phrase “under God.”

Republicans have been working to fill vacancies with conservatives, but suffered a setback this week when the White House withdrew the nomination of Ryan Bounds for the Ninth Circuit after realizing it did not have the necessary support in the Senate. He faced criticism over past college writings.

"It all began, and ended, on this day 43 years ago.

It was a hot July afternoon, nearly 92 degrees, when Teamsters president and labor icon Jimmy Hoffa is said to have opened the rear door of a 1975 maroon Mercury in the parking lot of the Machus Red Fox restaurant, in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and climbed in.

He was never seen again.

The FBI has expended countless resources in the ensuing decades in the hopes of finally solving this enduring American mystery with no success.

But I believe, based on my 2004 investigation, that Frank Sheeran did it.

""Suspects Outside of Michigan: Francis Joseph ""Frank"" Sheeran, age 43, president local 326, Wilmington, Delaware. Resides in Philadelphia and is known associate of Russel Bufalino, La Cosa Nostra Chief, Eastern Pennsylvania,"" reads the 1976 HOFFEX memo, the compilation of everything investigators knew about Hoffa's disappearance that was prepared for a high level, secret conference at FBI headquarters six months after he vanished.

Sheeran, known as ""The Irishman,"" told me that he drove with Hoffa to a nearby house where he shot him twice in the back of the head. Our investigation subsequently yielded the corroboration, the suspected blood evidence on the hardwood floor and down the hallway of that house, that supports Frank's story.

No one who has ever boasted about knowing what really happened to Jimmy Hoffa has had their claims tested, scrutinized, and then corroborated by independently discovered evidence... except Frank.

He is also the only one of the FBI's dozen suspects who has ever come forward and talked publicly about the killing, let alone admit involvement.

Every other claim that you have ever heard about, from Hoffa being buried in the end zone of Giants Stadium to being entombed under a strip of highway asphalt somewhere, came from people who were never on the bureau's list of people suspected of actual involvement.

For that reason, Frank stands alone.

Six weeks after Hoffa disappeared, Frank, along with the other suspects, was summoned before the Detroit grand jury investigating the case. He took the Fifth.

When I met him in the spring of 2001, Frank freely talked.

My meeting with Frank was arranged so that I could take his measure, and he mine, for a possible in-depth investigation, interview and news story about his claims. He was accompanied by his former lawyer Charlie Brandt, the author of Frank's then-proposed biography, which tells the Hoffa story. Charlie had been able to spring Frank from a Mafia-related federal racketeering prison sentence, and for that reason was taken into Frank's confidence.

It would be three years before the book, ""I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran And Closing The Case On Jimmy Hoffa"" would be published by Steerforth Press, and before the first of my many news stories about Frank, and our investigation, would air on television.

His story is this: He and others were ordered by the Mafia to kill Hoffa to prevent him from trying to run again for the presidency of the Teamsters union. Hoffa had resigned after serving prison time for jury tampering, attempted bribery and fraud convictions. Frank picked Hoffa up at the restaurant, accompanied by two others, to supposedly drive Hoffa to a mob meeting. When they walked into the empty house together, with Frank a step behind Hoffa, he raised his pistol at point-blank range and fired two fatal shots into his unsuspecting target, turned around and left. He said the body was then dragged down the hall by two awaiting accomplices, and that he was later told Hoffa was cremated at a mob-connected funeral home.

Frank had an imposing, old-school mobster way about him that even his advanced years -- he was 80 -- did not betray. His menacing aura was not diminished by a severe case of arthritis that crippled him so badly that he was hunched over when he slowly walked with two canes, struggling to put one foot in front of the other.

I found Frank tough, determined, steely.

As I listened to his matter-of-fact recounting of what he said went down at that house, and giving such detail, I remember thinking what he was saying could actually be true.

Here's why:

There is no doubt that Frank was a close confidant of Hoffa, someone who Hoffa trusted. And Hoffa didn't trust very many.

Frank was both a long-time top Teamsters Union official in Delaware as well as an admitted Bufalino crime family hit-man and top aide to the boss himself.

The FBI admits that Frank was ""known to be in Detroit area at the time of JRH disappearance, and considered to be a close friend of JRH,"" as the HOFFEX memo states.

Hoffa's son, current Teamsters President James P. Hoffa, told me in September 2001 that his father would have gotten into the car with Frank. He said that his father would not have taken that ride with some of the other FBI suspects whom I mentioned.

Frank, in the book, says that he sat in the front passenger seat of the car as a subtle warning to Hoffa, who habitually sat there. He felt a deep friendship and loyalty to Hoffa, yet knew what his own fate would be if he failed to carry out the lethal order from his mob masters. So he sat in the front seat hoping Hoffa would realize something was wrong. He did not.

The FBI did find ""a single three-inch brown hair . . . in the rear seat back rest"" of that car that matches Hoffa, and three dogs picked up ""a strong indication of JRH scents in the rear right seat.""

I asked Frank if he remembered how to get to the house. I thought finding where Hoffa was killed, and investigating everything about the house, could be key to the case. Frank rattled off the driving directions from the restaurant and described the house's interior layout.

Killers may not remember an exact address of a murder scene, but they never forget how they got there and what they did when they arrived.

""Sheeran gave us the directions,"" Charlie wrote in the book. ""This was the first time he had ever revealed the directions to me. His deepened voice and hard demeanor was chilling, when, for the first time ever, he stated publicly to someone other than me that he had shot Jimmy Hoffa.""

A year after our meeting, Charlie and Frank drove to Detroit to try to find the house, and when they did Frank pointed it out to Charlie. They did not go in.

Three years later, in 2004, I, along with producer Ed Barnes and Charlie, first stepped foot into the foyer where Frank said he shot Hoffa, looked around the first floor and as it turned out, Frank's description fit the interior to a tee.

Ed and I arranged with the homeowners to actually take up the foyer and hallway floorboards and remove the press-on vinyl floor tiles that they had put down over the original hardwood floors when they bought the house in 1989.

We hired a forensic team of retired Michigan state police investigators to try to find any blood evidence. They sprayed the chemical luminol on the floors, which homicide detectives routinely use to discover the presence of blood.

We found it.

The testing revealed a specific pattern of blood evidence, laid out like a map of clues to the nation's most infamous unsolved murder. Little yellow numbered tags were placed throughout the first floor foyer and hallway, to mark each spot where the investigators' testing yielded positive hits.

The pattern certainly told the story of how Hoffa was killed.

The greatest amount of positive hits were found right next to the front door, where Hoffa's bleeding head would have hit the floor.

Seven more tags lined the narrow hallway toward the rear kitchen, marking the drops that perfectly mimic Frank's story of Hoffa's lifeless body being dragged to the kitchen by the two waiting accomplices, who then stuffed it into a body bag and carried it out the back kitchen door.

We arranged for the Oakland County prosecutor's office to remove the floorboards for DNA testing by the FBI, though Oakland County Prosecutor David Gorcyca cautioned that it would be ""a miracle"" if Hoffa's DNA was recovered.

I knew those odds. A DNA hit was beyond a long shot.

Experts told me that such tiny samples of genetic material, degraded by the passage of 29 years and exposure to air and the elements under a homeowner's heavily trafficked floor, would likely not provide enough material to result in a DNA match.

The FBI lab report says that chemical tests were conducted on 50 specimens; 28 tested positive for the possible presence of blood, and DNA was only recovered from two samples.

The FBI compared what was recovered to the DNA from a known strand of Hoffa's hair. One sample was found to be ""of male origin,"" but it was not determined from whom. The other result was ""largely inconclusive.""

Was I disappointed that a DNA match was not possible? Yes. Was I surprised? No. Did I think this disproved Frank's claim? No.

Think about it.

What are the chances of any random house in America testing positive for blood traces from more than two dozen samples, in the exact pattern that corroborates a man's murder confession?

What would luminol reveal under your home's floor?

There are other reasons to believe why Frank's scenario fits.

The house was most likely empty on that fateful summer day. It was built in the 1920s and owned for five decades by a single woman, Martha Sellers, a teacher and department store employee. By the summer of 1975, Sellers was in her 80s, and not even living there full time. Her family told The Detroit News and Free Press that she had bought another home in Plymouth, Mich., where she would move permanently the next year.

Frank says that a man he called ""a real estater"" lived in the house. The Sellers family remembered that boarder, who they recalled resided in an upstairs bedroom. He was described as ""a shadowy figure . . . who would disappear. He never said more than a few words and they know nothing about him, not even his name.""

It is quite possible that ""the real estater,"" was the link between the house and the Detroit mob, providing an empty house as needed, when Sellers was absent, for whatever purpose...including using it as a Mafia hit house to murder Jimmy Hoffa.

The FBI clearly believed Sheeran had credibility. Agents visited him in his final years, in an unsuccessful attempt to secure his cooperation.

While we were conducting our investigation in Detroit in 2004, the FBI, I was told, tried to find the house even before we aired our story. To this day, the FBI refuses to comment about its investigation.

The views of those closest to Jimmy Hoffa, his son and daughter seem especially relevant when assessing Frank's credibility.

Not only did James P. Hoffa confirm that his father would have driven off with Frank, but his sister, Hoffa's daughter, Barbara Crancer, wrote Frank a poignant letter begging him to come clean about their father's fate.

In the one-page heartfelt note, handwritten to Frank on March 5, 1995, she wrote:

""It is my personal belief that there are many people who called themselves loyal friends who know what happened to James R. Hoffa, who did it and why. The fact that not one of them has ever told his family -- even under a vow of secrecy, is painful to me...""

She then underlined: ""I believe you are one of those people.""

Crancer confirmed to me that she wrote that letter.

Sadly for the Hoffa family, Frank never directly honored her request. When I sat with him, he said that his No. 1 priority was not to go back to ""college,"" meaning prison. He decided that the best way to avoid that possibility, while also revealing his story, was to share his secrets for the book and my reporting.

Frank died on Dec. 14, 2003. He was 83.

While authorities no doubt will continue to respond to more tips, as they should, I believe that we already know what happened to Jimmy Hoffa.

Frank described the most precise and credible scenario yet to be recounted, and the evidence that we found from the floor backs up his confession.

In the more than four decades since, Hoffa's life and legacy as a pivotal part of the American labor movement has been somewhat overshadowed by his disappearance. But it seems clear that organized crime bosses did not want him to resume the mantle of the Teamster's presidency, and went to the ultimate length, through Sheeran, to prevent his return.

Today Hoffa's union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, represents 1.4 million workers and continues to be headed by his son. Three years ago a milestone was marked in the attempts to shed any specter of possible organized crime. In 2015, Federal Judge Loretta Preska approved the Department of Justice and union agreement that ended the U.S. government oversight of the Teamsters that had lasted for more than 25 years.

The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time, Preet Bharara, said that the union had made ""significant progress"" in ""ridding...the influence of organized crime and corruption,"" though he cautioned that ""the threat...persists.""

Hoffa called it ""an historic agreement...our union is committed to the democratic process, and we can proudly declare that corrupt elements have been driven from the Teamsters.""

Sadly, it was those corrupt elements that took the life of his father as he tried to take back his union.

""Jimmy Hoffa raised millions of workers and their families out of poverty and into the middle class,” noted the Teamsters Union in a statement to Fox News.

“He gave his life while fighting to remove corrupt elements from the union and return power to the members. This tragic anniversary is particularly difficult on his family who lost a father and grandfather much too soon. They want nothing more than to have the closure that they so deserve.""

I am now working on a two-hour Fox News special about Jimmy Hoffa and Frank Sheeran, including the claims of others about Hoffa’s fate, as well as reporting on Hoffa’s contributions to the American labor movement and his legacy. Watch for the program, “Riddle: The Search for James R. Hoffa,” later this year. “Riddle” is Hoffa’s middle name.

Frank’s story will be told in a major motion picture, “The Irishman,” starring Robert De Niro as Frank and directed by Martin Scorsese. Tribeca Films and Sikelia Productions, in association with Netflix, will bring this story to the big screen and the streaming service in the fall of 2019. Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel are said to also have roles, uniting the legendary actors of the genre in one last mob movie. I am proud of pushing the film idea, which will no doubt become an iconic motion picture.",politics
"A dramatic video has emerged showing French and British fishermen battling for access to the scallop-rich waters off France’s northern coast.

The confrontation between 35 French boats and five British vessels in international waters began early Tuesday morning. The video captured the boats banging hulls while they fought over the territory, while it also showed at least one firework rocket being launched.

Two British boats were chased away by the French and returned to Brixham Harbour in Tor Bay. The boats’ windows were damaged, according to the BBC. The crew alleged rocks and metal shackles were hurled at them.

Maritime official Ingrid Parrot called the incident “very dangerous” and said French maritime authorities “really hope things will calm down.” No injuries were reported.

""Things were thrown on both sides -- from the English and from the French. Both parties were extremely tense,” Parrot said.

Parrot said every year there are problems between French and British fishermen over access to lucrative scallops, but it’s usually without violence.

British boats are legally allowed to collect scallops year-round, but French law restricts the scallop fishing season to between October 1 and May 15. The French however have accused the U.K. of ""depleting shellfish stocks"".

Dimitry Rogoff, who heads the Normandy fishing committee, told the BBC: ""For the Brits, it's an open bar - they fish when they want, where they want, and as much as they want.

""We don't want to stop them from fishing, but they could at least wait until 1 October so that we can share.""

British fisherman Nathan Clark, skipper of the Joanna C, told the Daily Mail that they would not be intimidated by the French.

""It won't stop us. We'll take a few days off but we'll go back out their again,""

"In San Francisco, immigrants who are in the country illegally are now eligible to register and vote in school board elections. Of course, this is clearly illegal under the California Constitution.

Article II, Section 2 of the California Constitution says: “A United States citizen 18 years of age and resident in this State may vote.”

However, the pro-illegal immigration, sanctuary state-supporting Democratic majority in the state Legislature has no interest in enforcing the law when it’s being ignored by fellow Democrats.

After all, the long-range plans Democrats have for a ruling majority depend on continuous law- breaking to get enough non-Americans to vote. The Californians who don’t support the radical views of Democrats can simply be eclipsed by non-citizen voters supporting the Democrats.

The long-range plans Democrats have for a ruling majority depend on continuous law- breaking to get enough non-Americans to vote. The Californians who don’t support the radical views of Democrats can simply be eclipsed by non-citizen voters supporting the Democrats.

As the San Francisco ABC News affiliate reported, the county’s District 7 Elections Supervisor Norman Yee said: ”We want to give immigrants the right to vote.”

Cal Thomas captured what is going on in a column last week headlined: “The Illegal Immigrant Vote. The name of the game: votes for Democrats.” As Thomas points out, this is only the beginning of a much larger strategy.

Thomas writes: “Who doubts this is the first step by the left and Democrats toward full voting rights in state and eventually in federal elections? The claim by lawyers will be that it is discriminatory to allow undocumented immigrants to vote in local and state elections and not for members of Congress and for president. At bottom this is what the entire immigration debate is about.”

Thomas concludes: “For Democrats, it’s a perfect cover for their ultimate goal: importing votes.”

With a broader critique than Thomas, Investor’s Business Daily published an editorial last week headlined: “Yes, Democrats Are Now The Party Of Open Borders.”

The editorial pointed out that only 18 Democrats voted in favor of a recent congressional resolution voicing support for our U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and the many federal and state officers who assist them. In fact, 35 Democrats voted against the bill and 133 voted “present” to avoid putting a solid opinion on record.

At the same time, the editorial noted that most congressional Democrats are standing idly by as eight of their members have sponsored a bill to abolish ICE, and many others are supporting a bill that would make it nearly impossible for ICE to do its job.

As the editorial put it: “Democrats want to neuter the one agency responsible for enforcing border security. They want to make it easy for illegals who cross to stay in the country. And they want to give them the right to vote. Leading Democrats also adamantly oppose building a secure border wall. They support ‘sanctuary cities’ that actively protect illegals from deportation. And they want to grant every illegal in the country amnesty.”

The editorial continued: “...the Democratic Party has been driving to the far left on a wide range of issues for many years. The only difference now is that its veneer of moderation has eroded to the point where Democrats can't hide their extremism any longer.”

As I wrote in my New York Times best-selling book “Trump’s America: The Truth About Our Nation’s Great Comeback,” the U.S. immigration system is indeed troubled. But it will never be fixed until we re-establish security at the borders and refocus on immigrants who want to come here legally – so they can actually become American.

A sound immediate step would be for Congress to pass a law reaffirming that you must be an American citizen to vote in all American elections. Let’s see how many Democrats would oppose this simple requirement.",politics
"Several U.S. Special Forces troops have been petitioning for special visas for the family of an heroic Iraqi interpreter killed in a 2007 suicide blast whose last words were, ""Take care of my son. Take care of my wife,"" Stars and Stripes reported Thursday.

Jay McBride, a former Special Forces medic, told the newspaper that Barakat Ali Bashar, an Iraqi linguist, sacrificed his life to save a squad of American Special Forces from a suicide bomber’s attack near the Syrian border in Sept. 2007.

Bashar, who assisted U.S. Special Forces during their fight against Al Qaeda in northern Iraq, was among 50 interpreters scheduled to gain entry to the U.S. under legislation signed by President George W. Bush and expanded under President Barack Obama.

After his death, Bashar’s family received compensation from the U.S. but never left Iraq.

“Is this how you treat a family of someone who worked five years with the U.S. Army; someone who was loyal to the U.S. and Iraq; someone who gave his life serving with U.S. Army soldiers and trying to protect them?” - Jay McBride, a former Special Forces medic

As of 2018, the family is living in a refugee camp in Kurdistan, the report said.

The family, which is of Yazidi descent, fled their home near Mount Sinjar after the Islamic State took control of the region in 2014, forcing to them leave behind documents proving Bashar had worked with the U.S.

The family told Stars and Stripes that Bashar’s history of service to the U.S. and their Yazidi ethnicity made them a target on multiple fronts.

“These radical groups target all Yazidis, however, our situation was much harder since even many so-called moderates view people who worked for the US Army and their families as enemies,” the family wrote in a statement.

In April, the family was interviewed by the International Organization for Migration, IOM, and their case was submitted to immigration authorities. In an Aug. 30 email, the U.S. Army Intelligence confirmed to Stars and Stripes that Bashar had been employed with the company, L3, as a linguist in Iraq at the time of his death.

McBride told Stars and Stripes that he and other veterans have been writing letters in support of the family’s special visa application since 2015.

“[Bashar] never faltered in his commitment to help American forces in Iraq, even after his family was threatened and their names were placed on a list that was circulated around the region, describing him as a traitor for supporting American forces,” said Michael Swett, another Special Forces soldier.

Bashar’s family is now waiting for a follow-up interview with the State Department.

“Is this how you treat a family of someone who worked five years with the U.S. Army; someone who was loyal to the U.S. and Iraq; someone who gave his life serving with U.S. Army soldiers and trying to protect them?” McBride said.",world
"Sen. Dan Sullivan said on Sunday that it would not be a politically smart move for President Trump to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Speaking on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” Sullivan, R-Alaska, said that despite months of strained relations between the president and the attorney general, and Trump having the legal authority to fire him, the Alaska lawmaker would caution against it.

""I supported Jeff Sessions when he was nominated. I certainly voted for him and I think he’s doing a good job,"" Sullivan said. “Would it be politically wise? I don’t think so, and I support Jeff Sessions and the job he's doing right now.”

Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Sessions on social media over the attorney general's decision last year to recuse himself from the FBI's Russia investigation. Last month, the president tweeted that Sessions ""doesn't understand what is happening underneath his command position"" and told ""Fox & Friends"" that his attorney general had ""never taken control of his department.""

The president also said that the only reason he named Sessions to one of his most important, Cabinet-level positions was the former Alabama senator's early support in the 2016 presidential election.

The comments prompted a pointed response from Sessions, who said in a statement that ""While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.""

In an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday, Trump said that Sessions will remain in his job at least until the November midterm elections. The president did not elaborate on if he would keep Sessions on as attorney general following the election.

Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett echoed the president's words on Sunday during an appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" in which he said Sessions would be gone after the midterm elections and suggested that Trump appoint Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, to the post.

Ratcliffe, a relative newscomer to Congress after he defeated 17-term incumbent Ralph Hall in a primary run-off in 2014, was ranked as the most conservative Texas legislator in Congress and second most conservative legislator in the country by the policy group Heritage Action.

"A former Ohio State wrestler on Thursday seemingly reversed course on an earlier claim that Republican Rep. Jim Jordan was aware of instances of alleged sexual abuse against students by a team doctor while he was a wrestling coach at Ohio State University.

Mark Coleman released a statement, via a public relations company, in which he sought to clear up “comments attributed to him that were not accurate or were misconstrued by media outlets.”

The company that provided the statement is the one hired by Jordan's campaign to respond to the claims.

“At no time did I ever say or have any direct knowledge that Jim Jordan knew of Dr. Richard Strauss’s inappropriate behavior,” Coleman was quoted as saying in the statement. “I have nothing but respect for Jim Jordan as I have known him for more than 30 years and know him to be of impeccable character.”

Male athletes from 14 sports at Ohio State have reported alleged sexual misconduct by Strauss, who was on the faculty and medical staff and published a variety of research. Strauss died in 2005, in what was ruled a suicide.

FORMER OHIO STATE COACHES DEFEND REP. JIM JORDAN AGAINST CLAIMS HE IGNORED SEXUAL ABUSE

Jordan was the assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State between 1986 and 1994. Strauss worked as the team doctor from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s.

Coleman was quoted in a July report from The Wall Street Journal doubting that Jordan was unaware of the accusations.

“There’s no way unless he’s got dementia or something that he’s got no recollection of what was going on at Ohio State,” Coleman said of the lawmaker. “I have nothing but respect for this man, I love this man, but he knew as far as I’m concerned.”

The Journal told Fox News that they stood by their reporting.

Jordan has maintained that he was unaware of instances of abuse, telling Fox News’ Bret Baier in an interview on “Special Report” last month that he “never saw, never heard of, never told of any kind of abuse.”

“We would’ve dealt with it if we knew of anything that happened,” he said.

JIM JORDAN FIGHTS CLAIMS HE IGNORED SEXUAL ABUSE, CALLING ALLEGATIONS ‘COMPLETELY FALSE’

Coleman also sought to separate himself from Mike DiSabato, an ex-wrestler who claimed Jordan had knowledge of the allegations.

“Mike DiSabato and his PR representative have released information and made statements publicly without my authorization and, in my opinion, are using them to exploit and embarrass The Ohio State University,” Coleman said in Thursday’s statement. “I am distancing myself from Mike DiSabato as he is not my manager and does not speak for me. I am also disappointed with many of the public statements made by Mr. DiSabato and his personal attacks on individuals employed by the university and others.”

Coleman, who wrestled at the 1992 Olympics and later became a UFC champion, went on to say that he is among Strauss’ alleged victims and wants to work with investigators “to see that whatever justice is achievable is achieved.”

A powerful earthquake shook Venezuela's northeastern coast and parts of the Caribbean but likely caused little damage besides knocking out power in some places and toppling supermarket shelves because of its depth, experts said.

The 7.3 quake Tuesday was the largest to strike Venezuela since 1900, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. But at a depth of some 76 miles (123 kilometers) beneath the Earth's surface it appeared to have caused only limited damage even near its epicenter a few miles off the Cariaco peninsula stretching into the eastern Caribbean.

""Shaking does die off at a distance,"" said seismologist Lucy Jones, a research associate with the California Institute of Technology, adding that the earthquake's considerable depth likely prevented a tragedy.

In Cumana, the biggest city near the quake's center, supermarket shelves came crashing down.

In downtown Caracas, concrete from the top floors of the unfinished Tower of David skyscraper fell to the sidewalk, forcing firefighters to close off traffic. A block away, children wearing surgical masks stretched their neck toward the 620-foot (190 meter) building after having fled a nearby foundation for poor children suffering from cancer.

""We felt something strong and they told everyone to run,"" said Marisela Lopez, who was at the foundation with her 7-year-old daughter when the quake struck.

Construction of the Tower of David began in 1990 as a symbol to the OPEC nation's ambitions of becoming a regional finance center. But it was abandoned after a banking crisis and in the past two decades of socialist rule has become a symbol of urban blight, having been occupied by squatters until 2015.

The quake was felt as far away as Colombia's capital of Bogota, where authorities briefly closed the international airport to inspect for runway damage.

The confusing moments after the quake were captured live on Venezuelan state television as Diosdado Cabello, the head of the all-powerful constitutional assembly, was delivering a speech at a march in support of the socialist government's recent package of reforms to rescue an economy beset by hyperinflation and widespread shortages.

""Quake!"" people yelled as Cabello and others looked from side to side with a mixture of laughter and concern. ""It's the Bolivarian revolution speaking to the world,"" Cabello thundered to applause.

Experts have long warned that Venezuela's cash-strapped government is ill-prepared to deal with a major natural disaster. Hospitals have scant supplies, many ambulances are grounded and food and water are among goods that have disappeared in a country suffering from inflation estimated by the International Monetary Fund to reach 1 million percent this year.

Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said that so far there were no reports of fatalities.

Power outages were reported across nearby Trinidad, where people ran into the street and gasped as large glass panes at one supermarket shattered and falling concrete smashed several cars. The quake also cracked walls and thousands of goods fell off supermarket shelves. No injuries or deaths were immediately reported.

The earthquake also was felt in Guyana, Barbados and Grenada.

It was showtime Thursday for the 12 boys and their 25-year old soccer coach, who shared their drama of being trapped for almost three weeks in a flooded cave in northern Thailand at a public exhibition in one of Bangkok's largest malls.

The exhibition featuring members of the Wild Boars soccer team also shows a reproduction of the cave with simulated sounds of water dripping. Equipment used by rescuers and other memorabilia are on display.

Psychologists had counseled that the boys after their rescue in July should be given a six-month respite from being pressed to recount their experience for the sake of their mental health. But Thailand's military government, eager to share the glory of the good-news story, has trotted them out for public appearances and interviews.

Other efforts to promote their story have included construction of a museum and the anointing as a national hero of a former Thai navy SEAL who died while diving in the cave delivering oxygen tanks.

One exception to the feel-good vibe has been an ongoing feud between tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and a British caving expert, Vernon Unsworth, whose advice and experience were considered crucial to the rescue operation.

Unsworth in an interview had criticized as showboasting a well-publicized effort by Musk to lend a custom-built mini-submarine to the rescue effort, and Musk responded on Twitter with comments strongly implying that the Briton was a pedophile.

The matter was revived last week, with Musk — asked about the threat of a libel suit — doubling down on his accusations, suggesting in emails to the news website BuzzFeed that Unsworth was a ""child rapist"" and had moved to northern Thailand to take ""a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time."" He provided no evidence for his allegations.

Musk, whose seemingly erratic behavior on other matters have drawn concern from investors, also in coarse terms told BuzzFeed that he hoped Unsworth sues him.

In Bangkok, deputy government spokesman Weerachon Sukhondhapatipak, who has been organizing many of the events with the boys, responded with concern to Musk's comments highlighting Thailand as a destination for sex tourists.

""When there is this kind of perception we shouldn't overlook it. This reflects our image, which we have to fix. We won't blame him and say 'Oh, he said all those bad things,'"" he said. ""We should take this information and use it to make changes.""

For the boys, mostly teenagers, the Musk controversy is not even a sideshow. They are carefully guided by a Thai government committee set up to control who has access to the boys as they draw attention from filmmakers and the media.

At least five of them at Thursday's forum said in more or less the same words that ""my life is the same, but more people are approaching me.""

The boys have already detailed much of their adventure in a news conference after they were released from hospital observation following their rescue, and in interviews with the U.S. television network ABC.

In a panel discussion moderated by Weerachon in the Siam Paragon mall on Thursday, they gave mostly brief replies. Adul Sam-on admitted that the area they were staying in the cave stank of urine — the matter of body excretions had been a subject of much speculation on social media.

The boys appeared unaware of the government's advice to avoid talking about their ordeal.

Adul said he was surprised when he met officials such as American diplomats, but was not asked about what happened in the cave. He said someone later told him that there was a ban on people asking them questions about it.

His teammate Ekarat Wongsukchan said he was also surprised why no one asked him about the events in the cave. ""I started to doubt whether I was also stuck in the cave,"" he said.

The boys and their coach later Thursday were scheduled to attend a government event dubbed ""United as One,"" a celebration with everyone involved in the rescue operation at an outdoor field in Bangkok.",world
"A team of scientists has singled out what it claims left U.S. diplomats in Cuba sickened by mysterious ailments and symptoms in recent months, according to a new report.

Douglas H. Smith, director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania, told The New York Times that microwaves, which can trick the brain into perceiving what seem to be ordinary sounds — known as the Frey effect, named after American scientist Allan H. Frey — most likely caused the trauma.

The Times reported that scientists have known for decades that the brain can perceive some microwaves as sound.

“Everybody was relatively skeptical at first, and everyone now agrees there’s something there,” Smith told the Times.

The State Department told Fox News that the investigation into the embassy attacks is still ongoing.

Some two dozen American diplomats in Cuba have fallen ill as a result of the episodes — the perception of loud noises, including ringing, buzzing and grinding — which were first made public last year, and have been deemed “specific attacks” by the U.S. government, as Fox News previously reported.

Strikes with microwaves best explain reports of the painful sounds, ills and traumas, the Times reported, rather than what was initially suspected: sonic attacks, viral infections and contagious anxiety.

The initial symptoms and diagnoses were seen as evidence of stealthy attacks with sonic weapons.

The Cuban incidents resulted in a diplomatic rupture between Havana and Washington, as the Times noted.

The United States has said it doesn’t know who is behind it, but has argued Cuba is responsible for protecting all diplomats on its soil.

"Despite North Korea’s promise to work toward “complete denuclearization” following the historic summit with Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump earlier this month, new satellite imagery indicates North Korea is making improvements to one of its nuclear scientific research centers at a “rapid pace.”

The images published in a report from 38 North, a website that specializes in analysis of the Rogue Nation, are from June 21 and reveal construction of new buildings and the completion of a plutonium production reactor as well as other support facilities at the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Facility.

The center is North Korea’s main research facility, according to Sky News.

“Modifications to North Korea’s 5 MWe reactor’s secondary cooling loop, which began in March, appear externally complete,” according to the report. “A newly in-filled water channel (that includes a newly installed probable weir for controlling water flow) now leads to the pump house from the Kuryong River.”

The operational status of the reactor was not clear.

Although the images appear to show “improvements to infrastructure,” the report said the “continued work at the Yongbyon facility should not be seen as having any relationship to North Korea’s pledge to denuclearize.”

Trump and Kim signed an agreement in Singapore on June 12 stating that Pyongyang would work toward ""complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”

Last week, the president underscored the point of “total denuclearization,” while noting that it “has already started taking place,” according to Reuters.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNN Monday there is no timeline for when North Korea will denuclearize the peninsula, but said the U.S. is “committed to moving forward in an expeditious moment to see if we can achieve what both leaders set out to do.”

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe met on Wednesday to discuss how to ensure North Korea abandons its nuclear program.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo may have just handed Republicans a ready-made campaign ad for his rumored 2020 presidential bid – by declaring Wednesday that America “was never that great.”

The Democratic star made the seemingly offhand remark as part of his rebuke of President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan during a bill-signing in New York. But the line drew gasps from the crowd.

“We’re not going to make America great again. It was never that great,” Cuomo said, to an awkward blend of gasps and chuckles.



“We have not reached greatness, we will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged, we will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51 percent of our population, is gone and every woman’s full potential is realized and unleashed and every woman is making her full contribution,” he said.

Within hours, his spokeswoman tried walking it back. “The Governor believes America is great and that her full greatness will be fully realized when every man, woman, and child has full equality. America has not yet reached its maximum potential,” Cuomo's press secretary, Dani Lever, said in a statement. “When the President speaks about making America great again - going back in time - he ignores the pain so many endured and that we suffered from slavery, discrimination, segregation, sexism and marginalized women's contributions. The Governor believes that when everyone is fully included and everyone is contributing to their maximum potential, that is when America will achieve maximum greatness.”

But the “never that great” line tore through social media in a New York minute, as journalists and his political rivals seized on the remark.

Republican gubernatorial candidate Marc Molinaro said America, “with its imperfections, has always been great” and called on Cuomo to apologize.

“This governor is so determined to distract voters from his failed policies and corrupted administration that he’s willing to dismiss the steady, determined march of the American people, making and remaking the greatness of America. Mr. Cuomo owes the nation an apology,” he said in a statement. “He should be ashamed of himself.""

Cuomo for months has been positioning himself as one of the biggest gubernatorial foes of the Trump White House. He also is facing a primary challenge from the left from actress and activist Cynthia Nixon.

Nixon has made a number of controversial statements, including calling Immigration and Customs Enforcement a terrorist organization, and has claimed Cuomo is shifting to the left in response.

'SEX AND THE CITY' STAR CYNTHIA NIXON BOASTS CUOMO BEING DRAGGED TO THE LEFT BY 'THE CYNTHIA EFFECT'



“It’s called The Cynthia Effect,” Nixon said in a speech in May. “Since I got in the race, Cuomo has moved left not only on marijuana, but climate change, teacher evaluations, restoring voting rights and banning plastic bags.”

But it remains to be seen whether Cuomo's stances in the New York race could come back to haunt a 2020 bid. Earlier this week while addressing New York Republicans, Trump dared Cuomo to run against him.

“Please do it. Please,” the president said in Utica, adding that “anybody that runs against Trump suffers.”

"Minutes after pulling out of a highly anticipated summit with North Korea, President Trump said Thursday that the U.S. would continue its ""maximum pressure campaign,"" and warned that the military was ""ready if necessary"" -- but made clear that a summit could still go forward if Kim Jong Un is willing to engage constructively.

“Our military, which is by far the most powerful anywhere in the world ... is ready if necessary,” Trump said.

“Likewise, I’ve spoken with South Korea and Japan, and they are not only ready should foolish or reckless acts be taken by North Korea, but they’re willing to shoulder much of the costs associated by operations if such an unfortunate situation is forced upon us,” he added.

He said that the “very strong sanctions” and the “maximum pressure campaign will continue.”

However, the president clearly left open the possibility of the scheduled summit taking place, despite his letter to Kim Jong Un canceling talks following threats of nuclear action from the rogue regime.

“Hopefully,"" he said, ""everything is going to work out well with North Korea. A lot of things can happen, including the fact—it’s possible the existing summit could take place, or a summit at a later date.”

Trump added: “Nobody should be anxious. We have to get it right.”

The move to pull out of the summit, which had been slated to take place in Singapore on June 12, came after threats from Kim to call off the talks. In a letter to Kim on Thursday, Trump said the world, and North Korea, had lost a ""great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity.""

“Based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,” Trump wrote in a letter to Kim on Thursday. “Therefore, please let this letter serve to represent that the Singapore summit, for the good of both parties, but to the detriment of the world, will not take place.”

North Korea has for days questioned whether the summit would proceed as planned.

On Thursday, Vice Minister of the North Korean Foreign Ministry Choe Son Hui said that whether the U.S. ""will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and behavior of the United States,"" South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported.

The official also insulted Vice President Pence after he said North Korea had asked for the meeting. ""As a person involved in the U.S. affairs, I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the U.S. vice president,"" Choe reportedly said.

But officials told Fox News it was the threat of nuclear war -- not the insult to Pence -- that had led to the summit pullout.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who met with Trump at the White House on Monday, convened an emergency meeting with top security aides on Thursday following Trump's announcement, and expressed “deep regret” over the canceled U.S.-North Korea summit.

According to Yonhap, Moon urged the two leaders to engage in direct talks.

We ""are trying to figure out what President Trump's intention is and the exact meaning of it,"" presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom reportedly said.

Moon said the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should not be delayed.

The Trump-Kim summit was set to come on the heels of a “historic meeting” between North and South Korea last month, when the leaders from those two nations pledged to clear the peninsula of nuclear weapons.

Moon and Kim announced they would work to achieve a “nuclear-free Korean Peninsula,” and also expressed hope to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War by the end of the year, though it is not clear at this point what steps the leaders might take to achieve denuclearization.

“KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!” Trump tweeted last month.

The leaders had agreed that by May 1, the loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts that had been blaring from each side of the heavily armed border would be suspended. They agreed to also dismantle broadcasting equipment and stop flying propaganda leaflets across their border.

Kim also promised Moon that he “won’t interrupt” his “early morning sleep anymore,” referring to missile tests, South Korea said.

But Kim’s tune changed last week; he canceled a high-level summit with Moon following U.S.-South Korean military exercises, which the state-run Korean media outlet suggested were a rehearsal for a potential invasion of the North.",politics
"Top police officials in Massachusetts have accused Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of insulting rank-and-file officers when she said the criminal justice system was ""racist ... front to back"" earlier this month.

Warren made the remarks Aug. 3 at Dillard University, a historically black college. She cited disproportionate arrests of African-Americans for petty drug possession; an overloaded public defender system; and state laws barring convicted felons from voting after their sentences are complete.

In response, Yarmouth Police Chief Frank Frederickson called Warren's comments ""an insult to the hard working men and women of the Yarmouth Police Department, as well as other Local, State and Federal Law Enforcement Agencies who are part of the criminal justice system.""

In a letter to Warren, Massachusetts Chief of Police Association President Steven Wojnar said he was ""extremely troubled"" by the senator's comments.

""Labeling the entire criminal justice profession as 'racist' spreads false and damaging information about our members,"" Wojnar wrote. ""When our elected officials make generalized and inflammatory statements about our entire profession, without any information to back their position, it creates further hostility toward our officers and can damage the positive relationships with our residents that we have worked long and hard to establish.""

Attorney General Jeff Sessions also called out Warren during a speech in Georgia on Thursday, calling her statement ""a slander of every law officer and every prosecutor in America. And, frankly, I think it is an insult to their families and to the crime victims they have helped to face their attacker.""

In a statement obtained by The Boston Globe this weekend, Warren said: ""I spoke about an entire system — not individuals — and will continue to work on reforms to make the criminal justice system fairer.

""The entire law enforcement system has a lot of good people who get up every day and try to make this a more just, a more fair, more responsive system. And they say over and over, the system needs reform. It needs change.""

A spokeswoman for Warren's Senate re-election campaign told the Globe that Warren spoke to Frederickson on Saturday. Warren's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Fox News.

Warren is heavily favored to win a second Senate term in deep-blue Massachusetts this November. She is also considered a top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.

"Three experts working for the U.N.'s top human rights body say the governments of Yemen, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia may have been responsible for war crimes including rape, torture, disappearances and ""deprivation of the right to life"" during 3½ years of escalated fighting against rebels in Yemen.

In their first report for the Human Rights Council, the experts also point to possible crimes by rebel Shiite militia in Yemen, which has been fighting the Saudi-led coalition and Yemen's government since March 2015.

The experts have also chronicled the damages from coalition air strikes, the single most lethal force in the fighting, over the last year.

They urged the international community to ""refrain from providing arms that could be used in the conflict ""— an apparent reference to countries like the United States and Britain that help arm the Saudi-led coalition, as well as Iran, which the coalition has accused of say has been arming the Houthis.

The experts visited some but not all parts of Yemen as they compiled the report.

""(We have) reasonable grounds to believe that the governments of Yemen, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are responsible for human rights violations,"" the report said. It cited violations including unlawful deprivation of the right to life, arbitrary detention, rape, torture, enforced disappearances and child recruitment.

It accused the ""de facto authorities"" — an allusion to rebel leaders that control some of the country's most populated western and northern areas — of crimes including arbitrary detentions, torture and child recruitment.

Since March last year, the U.N.'s humanitarian aid agency has called Yemen the world's worst humanitarian crisis — with three-fourths of its population of over 20 million in need of humanitarian assistance. The war has devastated the country's health system and provided the breeding grounds for the world's largest cholera outbreak last year.

The experts cited some 6,475 deaths from the conflict between March 2015 and June this year, but said the ""real figure is likely to be significantly higher.""

They also sharply criticized work by the coalition's Joint Incidents Assessment Team, which was set up as a bulwark against possible rights violations. They questioned the JIAT's explanations for the air strikes that have killed civilians, and challenged its ""independence and its ability to carry out impartial investigations.""

The experts also said nearly a dozen deadly airstrikes they investigated over the last year ""raise serious questions about the targeting process applied by the coalition."" They chastised some in-the-field coalition combatants for ""routinely"" failing to seek information about official ""no-strike"" lists that should have been avoided.

Even getting the experts up and running was an accomplishment for the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, which passed a resolution creating the team last September. Largely due to the objections of Saudi Arabia and its allies, the council failed several times to authorize more intrusive investigation into possible war crimes in Yemen. The 47-member body only last fall reached a compromise to bring in the experts.",world
"Former Trump adviser Michael Caputo’s suggestion that a second government informant may have been snooping on the president’s 2016 campaign came into question overnight, as two other individuals involved in the flagged discussions downplayed their role.

Caputo had told Fox News, in two televised interviews, that he was approached in 2016, likening the situation to revelations that another government informant made contacts with several other Trump advisers in the early stages of the Russia probe.

Caputo told Neil Cavuto Tuesday on “Your World” that he was approached in early May 2016 by an intermediary “who had been talking to a government official” looking to connect with the Trump campaign -- purportedly to hand off Hillary Clinton-related emails.

But when contacted by Fox News, the individual who supplied the information – a government contractor – denied having ever contracted for an intelligence agency and downplayed the interaction as “cocktail party talk about where to go do opposition research.” The individual claimed to have gotten the information in question after meeting with an NSA contractor who shared information about a purported email depicting ‘pay-for-play’ between the Clinton Global Initiative and State Department.

The individual stressed that they are not connected with any of the intelligence agencies and were not trying to reach out to the Trump campaign on behalf of any agency, but rather passing along unconfirmed information about the Clinton campaign they thought should be pursued.

The intermediary, meanwhile, confirmed being approached at a Washington party and being urged to “go after the Hillary emails.” Fox News has reviewed texts among the three individuals, which include allegations of emails showing ‘pay-for-play.’

Caputo has since told The Daily Wire that this “could be a great big misunderstanding.” It is possible the discussions concerned suggestions for pursuing emails as opposed to a more direct offer.

Caputo, though, explained to Cavuto that he was coming forward amid concern that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees did not seem interested.

“I gave this information to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, and I gave this information to the Mueller team. They never reached out to the intermediary to check on it,” he said. “They didn't even seem to be taking notes.”

He also said he didn’t want to bring the information to the Trump campaign at the time for fear of looking “kooky.”

Caputo added, “It was frightening to me. It could be a crime for me to take them into my own custody.”

He also noted he didn’t think much about the incident until WikiLeaks revealed information about the Clinton campaign in October 2016.

"WASHINGTON -- Michael Cohen's decision to plead guilty for making hush-money payments on Donald Trump's behalf has raised the prospect that if Democrats take control of Congress, they might try to impeach the president over a matter completely unrelated to a perceived criminal conspiracy with Russia. Good luck with that: Even if Democrats win back both the House and Senate, there is zero chance a two-thirds majority of senators will convict President Trump for paying off an adult-film star.

It would be the height of hypocrisy if Democrats tried to remove the president over allegations of illegality relating to extramarital affairs. During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, congressional Democrats told us the private sexual conduct of a president does not matter, and that lying under oath to cover up a ""consensual relationship"" is not an impeachable offense. Then-Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said President Bill Clinton's lies under oath about his sexual relationship with a White House intern might have been illegal, but declared the scandal ""a tawdry but not impeachable affair"" -- right before heading off to a fundraiser with Clinton. At the time, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declared that the Starr investigation ""vindicates President Clinton in the conduct of his public life because we're only left with this personal stuff"" and that Founding Fathers ""would say it was not for the investigation of a president's personal life that we risked our life, our liberty, and our sacred honor.""

But now that a Republican president is accused of covering up an affair, suddenly Democrats are channeling their inner Kenneth W. Starr.

Today, Democrats are outraged and appalled when Trump attacks special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and calls his inquiry a ""witch hunt."" But back then, then-Sen. Joe Biden called the Starr investigation ... wait for it ... a ""witch hunt."" Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., declared Starr was ""out of control"" and accused him of having a ""fixation of trying to topple the president of the United States."" Rahm Emanuel, then a White House senior adviser, accused Starr of engaging in ""a partisan political pursuit of the president"" while White House special counsel Lanny Davis (who is now representing Cohen) said Starr was a ""desperate prosecutor who can't make a case on Whitewater"" and who should face ""possible removal because of his conduct.""

The fact is, Democrats were not alone in their concern that an investigation into Whitewater morphed into a perjury probe against Clinton for lying about his relationship with Lewinsky. Many Republicans agreed that independent counsels had too much power. So in 1999, the GOP-controlled Congress, in its wisdom, let the independent counsel law expire. We were promised that investigators answerable to the Justice Department would be more focused on their original purpose.

Well, it seems like we're right back where we started. Federal prosecutors were supposed to be investigating Russian collusion. Instead, we have an inquiry into the Trump Organization's finances and whether Trump's payments to Stormy Daniels violated campaign-finance laws. Both might be worthy of scrutiny but at least under the precedent Democrats set during the 1990s, they are not grounds for impeachment.

If Democrats do try to impeach Trump over anything but a criminal conspiracy with Russia, they will regret it. The president was legitimately elected by Americans who knew about his lecherous past and supported him anyway. Indeed, Trump's election was a direct result of the Democrats' victory in the culture war of the 1990s. Republicans are now simply playing by the rules Democrats established. Millions of Americans absorbed the lesson that Clinton and his Democratic enablers taught us -- that a president's ""personal stuff,"" as Pelosi put it, does not matter -- and chose Trump. They will consider any effort to impeach him over it an effort to invalidate their votes. And the blow back will be tremendous. If you thought the ""deplorables"" were mad in 2016, just wait until 2020.

This does not mean Trump is out of the woods legally. Once he leaves office, Trump may have to face consequences for anything illegal he might have done. When Clinton left office, he was forced to give up his Arkansas law license for five years and paid a $25,000 fine as part of a deal with the independent counsel to avoid a perjury prosecution -- which resulted in him being disbarred from practicing law before the Supreme Court.

If Mueller finds conclusive evidence that Trump entered into a criminal conspiracy with Russia, then by all means impeach away. But absent such evidence, the idea that Stormy Daniels is going to bring down Trump is a liberal fantasy. If Democrats are upset that they cannot remove Trump over this, well, sorry -- they set the precedent.",politics
"Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Secretary of State Brian Kemp advanced to a July runoff vote Tuesday night in the state's GOP race for governor, after grueling campaigns that saw the candidates battling over who carried the most social conservative credentials.

After failing to receive 50 percent of the vote, Cagle and Kemp are set to compete in what analysts say is likely to be both an expensive and nasty campaign.

The crowded ticket included five candidates competing to fill the shoes of outgoing Gov. Nathan Deal. Cagle of Gainesville, Kemp of Athens, former state Sen. Hunter Hill of Atlanta, state Sen. Michael Williams of Cumming and businessman Clay Tippins of Atlanta battled it out.

Throughout the campaign, the GOP candidates touted their conservative credentials with campaign ads that were seen as both humorous and controversial.

In one ad, Kemp pointed a shotgun in the direction of a teenage boy interested in dating one of his daughters. And Williams earned both praise and protests after branding his campaign bus as a “deportation bus.”

Back in February, Cagle made headlines after he threatened to kill a tax break for Georgia’s largest employer, Delta, in retaliation for the airline’s decision to sever ties with the NRA.

Nevertheless, it was Cagle and Kemp who stood out.

Although the winning candidate should be favorite in the fall, some Georgia Republicans are concerned that a nasty runoff could harm the party come November.

Deal, the current governor, is a pro-business Republican who won friends across the aisle with his prison-reform initiatives and his veto of a 2016 “religious liberty” bill that would have allowed faith-based organizations to deny employment or services to those who violate their religious beliefs, including gays and lesbians.

Stacey Abrams won the Democratic primary on Tuesday, making her the first woman gubernatorial nominee in Georgia from either major party.

Both Abrams and Stacey Evans ran as former state lawmakers and attorneys who seemed to align themselves on policy but shredded each other's legislative and legal careers. Both candidates also had differing views as to how the party could flip the state.

Abrams, 44, argued that Democrats could turn the GOP-run state only by expanding the electorate and attracting younger and nonwhite voters to the Democratic column. Evans, 40, however, felt that liberal policies could be pitched to all voters, even including white Georgians who have abandoned Democrats in recent decades.

If Abrams were to win later this year, she would be the first black female governor in any state.

"Special Counsel Robert Mueller seems determined to press forward with some version of the Spanish Inquisition – an increasingly indefensible, apparently groundless, objectively debilitating inquiry into what was initially one question: Did the Trump campaign knowingly coordinate with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election?

Barring something that has remained hidden for more than 20 months, Americans know the facts: Mueller’s inquisition was triggered by several Obama-Clinton partisans, including anti-Trump appointees at the FBI and CIA.

The names of these partisans now trigger nausea: Fired FBI Director James Comey; former CIA Director John Brennan; former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper; fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe; disgraced FBI Agent Peter Strzok (whose firing was announced Monday); former FBI lawyer Lisa Page (who was carrying on an extramarital affair with Strzok); and several others.

Even the story line is now nauseating. Comey, despite holding clearances as head of the FBI, contradicted himself before Congress, leaked documents through a secret cutout, proudly triggered Mueller’s appointment, and then cashed in with a big-money book.

Brennan traded his role as intelligence briefer in President Clinton’s White House for political gain in President Obama’s. When he ran the CIA he fed partisan anti-Trump information to the FBI, possibly circumventing U.S. laws by procuring foreign involvement. By some reports, he may have even sought to legally block Trump’s inauguration.

This increasingly baseless, meandering, delegitimized inquisition is not only distracting, discouraging and a dangerous drag on democracy – exactly what Russia, China and Iran want – but it does no one any good.

Clapper, already famous for misleading Congress under oath, became another vocal anti-Trump detractor.

Then Andrew McCabe, No. 2 at the FBI under Comey, turned out to be a subterranean anti-Trump partisan, who was reproached by the Justice Department’s inspector general for breach of integrity.

And as for Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, despite FBI employment and centrality to an “investigation” clearing Hillary Clinton, both were prolific anti-Trump texting partners and made it clear that they did not want to see him become president.

The saga rivals a Shakespearean tragedy, and has frankly made average Americans disgusted. It now threatens to darken America’s midterm elections – exactly what the Russians have wanted, we know now.

So I have a recommendation for ending the tragedy before our country is consumed by this third-rate play, an ever-widening, seemingly unlimited inquiry into everything and anything that could possibly justify more authority, taxpayer dollars, distraction, time and the civil disruption. After all, that is what baseless inquisitions always do. This recommendation may save the nation from more mutual recrimination and civil unrest.

Clearly, Mueller wants to build a case for impeachment, despite every indication that there is no evidence to support the cause. He wants to compel an incriminating presidential deposition, trap President Trump into a contradiction to warrant obstruction of justice charges, and use that as a pretext to help partisan Democrats in Congress lead a fight to impeach the president.

It seems that Mueller wants to turn his team into heroes of the left – like Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame – by bringing down a Republican president. Who knows, maybe Mueller envisions an aging Robert Redford (who played Woodward in the film “All the President’s Men” in 1976) coming out of his recently-announced retirement to play him on the silver screen.

It’s time to bring this drama – or perhaps we should call it a farce – to a close. To end this inquiry, President Trump may need to step up, and not on Twitter. That’s because the Mueller probe is down to a game of chicken over whether to subpoena the president’s personal testimony – a risky course both for the president and for Mueller’s team.

If President Trump resists an open-ended deposition and Mueller seeks one by subpoena anyway, Mueller could lose at the Supreme Court. This would probably force the winding down of the special counsel’s unruly inquisition, and possibly tip public sentiment toward the president.

However, if Mueller gambles on the subpoena and wins, everything goes the other way. The president is forced to testify with fewer limitations, Mueller is re-empowered, public opinion tips against the president.

Notably, the average American loses in both eventualities. If Mueller wins, we can expect a grueling deposition, more tricks and traps – and a messy, drawn out and ultimately useless impeachment confrontation.

If President Trump wins at the Supreme Court, Mueller’s inquisition is dealt a blow, but with no incentive for closure or resolution, just stalemate. Mueller’s resentment could rise and the inquiry could go on even longer.

There is a third way. If it is to work, it needs to happen now, without delay. President Trump could offer a credible, workable compromise – perhaps some sworn answers to written questions and an interview on limited topics.

To wait until the subpoena is issued is a dead end. President Nixon tried that, and failed miserably. Yes, circumstances were different, but the gamble becomes a debilitating distraction – and ends any chance of compromise.

After U.S. District Judge John Sirica upheld the subpoena of tapes that President Nixon secretly recorded of his Oval Office conversations – and the Supreme Court sided with Sirica – Nixon tried to compromise. He offered transcripts, verified by a Democratic senator. That might have worked before the subpoena, but the offer came too late.

Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox had won on the tapes subpoena, so Nixon’s compromise was useless. Cox declined the compromise and Nixon fired him in the “Saturday Night Massacre.” The rest is history. Confronting impeachment, Nixon resigned and was also nearly indicted, until President Ford pardoned him.

What is the lesson from this page out of the history books?

For Mueller and President Trump: Do not put our nation through any more of this inquisition mess, even if Republicans continue to control Congress, even if the Supreme Court is likely to side with the president on personal testimony, even if both sides think they could win.

This increasingly baseless, meandering, delegitimized inquisition is not only distracting, discouraging and a dangerous drag on democracy – exactly what Russia, China and Iran want – but it does no one any good.

Let’s find a way to end it, consistent with rule of law. To get to that end state, President Trump may need to compromise and so will Mueller. That outcome would be best for America. This is not medieval Spain circa 1478, but modern America 2018. Is that too much to ask?",politics
"The Trump administration is escalating an effort to revive the flagging U.S. coal industry with a planned move next week to replace restrictive Obama-era climate policies with new rules designed to help coal-burning plants run harder and stay open longer.

The proposed new rules, which the Environmental Protection Agency plans is expected to release within days, would be the latest in a series of reversals of policies the Obama administration adopted to slow climate change. It would replace the agency’s so-called Clean Power Plan for the electricity business with regulations that cede power to states, and could ultimately lead to more heat-trapping gases going into the atmosphere even as it sets parameters to boost efficiency at coal-fired power plants.

President Trump has repeatedly promised to support coal, an industry beset by a shrinking customer base, competition, falling prices and bankruptcies; the plan may be his administration’s most ambitious effort yet to kill regulations on coal’s behalf.

And yet plummeting costs of cleaner fuels including natural gas, wind and solar in recent years have driven consumers and power companies away from coal so dramatically, they may blunt the proposal’s ultimate effect.

The Trump administration proposal would have to be submitted for a public rule-making process before taking effect. It would apply to the power industry at large, but is firmly targeted at coal.

Senior administration officials familiar with the proposal say it outlines technology that coal-burning plants can employ to produce more power from less fuel. It would also eliminate triggers that would mandate overhauls at plants, a rollback to encourage coal-burning units to make smaller improvements, which could extend the profitable lifespans of those plants by many years.

"Singer John Legend lashed out at House Speaker Paul Ryan on Saturday after the lawmaker posted a Father’s Day video about his children amid a controversy over a policy involving immigrant families getting split up at the border.

“Seriously, f--k you,” Legend tweeted. “Reunite the families at the border and we can talk about father's day.”

Legend’s reaction comes as the Trump administration has drawn criticism for the separation of parents and children attempting to cross the southern border into the U.S.

TRUMP ACCUSES DEMOCRATS OF PROTECTING MS-13 GANG MEMBERS: ‘THEY WANT THEM TO BE LEFT ALONE’

In a Twitter video titled “How Becoming a Father Changed My Life,” Ryan reflects on how having children has altered his ambitions over the course of his career.

In the caption, Ryan wrote that his “life changed the day I became a father.”

“Liza, Charlie, and Sam are my highest priority,” he continued. “Wishing all of the dads out there a happy early #FathersDay.”

In April, Ryan cited the goal of spending more time with his wife and children as a primary motivation for not seeking re-election.

Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a ""zero tolerance"" policy saying that any adult who entered the country illegally would be criminally prosecuted. U.S. protocol prohibits detaining children with their parents because the children are not charged with a crime and the parents are.

CHRISSY TEIGEN SLAMS TRUMP ON HIS BIRTHDAY, ENCOURAGES FANS TO DONATE TO ACLU TO MARK THE OCCASION

As a result, several hundred children were split up from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border over a two-week period last month, according to Customs and Border Protection.

The president has fought back against criticisms and leveled blame at Democrats, who he claimed were “forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda.” He tweeted Saturday that “Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change!”

Legend and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, have been outspoken opponents of Trump’s administration. Earlier this week, Teigen took to Twitter to criticize the immigration policy and explained that she and members of her family were donating $72,000 to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to mark the president’s 72nd birthday and urged others to contribute what they could.

"Thousands of Trump supporters and right-wing activists took to the nation’s capital on Saturday — a day after anti-Trump protesters had dominated the city.

While the displays of right-wing support were nowhere near as large as the enormous anti-Trump march that demanded the international media’s attention the day before, it was still a significant show of support for Trump from those eager to counter the claim that Trump had been unanimously rejected by Britons.

THOUSANDS MARCH AGAINST TRUMP IN ROWDY LONDON PROTESTS

The day started with a small pro-Trump rally outside the U.S. Embassy, featuring numerous red “MAGA” hats and U.S. and U.K. flags -- as well as a few anti-Hillary Clinton shirts.



Later, approximately 3,000 people turned out near Trafalgar Square to show their backing of Trump as well as jailed right-wing and anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson.

“Oh Tommy Tommy, Tommy Tommy Tommy Tommy Robinson,” the football chant for the activist thundered throughout the event.



Robinson, the ex-leader of the English Defense League, was jailed for 13 months beginning earlier in May for contempt of court after being arrested filming outside a court in Leeds. His supporters have claimed that the law was applied unevenly and have expressed concern for his safety in prison, considering his history of criticizing Islam.

A number of right-wing groups were present at the march, including Generation Identity — which calls itself a “European patriotic youth movement” — as well as a number of right-wing Western politicians. Controversial Dutch MP Geert Wilders made an address by video, while Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., spoke about the importance of free speech.



The speeches were a blend of support for Trump, Robinson and also concerns about the danger of mass migration and the importance of national sovereignty.



U.S. flags were again in abundance, as well as pro-Trump banners and placards reading ""Britain Loves Trump.""



“The rubbish that was spouted about Trump yesterday, it’s complete unjustified vitriol against him,” Robert Stevens, wearing a Trump T-shirt, told Fox News. “I’m not a massive Trump fan but the geezer in my opinion has done nothing wrong.”



He also rejected the idea that the majority of people at the protests were “far-right.”



“I don’t think we’re right wing, we certainly ain’t left but we just want what’s right and I think Tommy Robinson represents everything what’s right about just working class people speaking up to all the wrongs and that,” he said.



The event came to a close by a video of Trump reading the lyrics to “The Snake” -- often used by Trump as an allegory for Islamic immigration.

The Trump and Robinson supporters then marched up through the street, which was marred by a group of a handful of Robinson supporters blocking traffic near Trafalgar Square.



As police negotiated with those demonstrators, others yelled at them to get out of the road -- nervous as increasing numbers of photographers took pictures of those blocking the path of a bus, which was being driven by a woman in a hijab.



“We ain’t gonna get nowhere with you lot,” one man blocking traffic yelled at other protesters stood on the sidewalk. The man would later tell Fox News that he wanted to hold traffic up to “cost the British government some money -- because that’s all they understand.”



“You’re a f------g idiot,” a fellow marcher yelled back at him, urging the police to “drag him out” of the road. The Evening Standard later reported that there had been 12 arrests after clashes broke out in Westminster.



Robinson supporters were likely to be buoyed by a Reuters report that said that Sam Brownback, the U.S. ambassador for International Religious Freedom, complained to the British ambassador in Washington D.C. about Robinson’s treatment.

A State Department official told Fox News that the characterizations of the meeting were “completely false.”



Across the other side of London, a pub in Hammersmith had renamed itself “The Trump Arms” for the presidential visit and was scheduled to hold an event Saturday evening featuring hot dogs, cocktails and other American treats.



Decorated with copious amounts of American flags, MAGA caps and a life-size cutout of President Trump, patrons told Fox News they had come out of their way to show support for Trump.



Mark Nicholas said he objected to the way Trump had been treated when he visited London.



“If the Queen was treated in America the same way, we’d be up in arms,” he said. I think whether you like him or don’t like him, he should be treated accordingly.”



Landlord (currently going by the title of “chief of staff”) Damien Smyth, said that it was London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s approval of the “Trump baby” balloon that made him take the leap into changing the name of the establishment.



“What an insult, not an insult to Trump because he’s a tough old dog, there’s no problem with him,” he said. ""But it is an insult to the good decent American people who did vote for Mr. Trump.”



Smyth said that they were seeing a huge increase of people coming to the pub, and the reception had been overwhelmingly positive.



Outside the pub, a few protesters made their stand. Margaret Owen was wearing a sign saying “Dump Trump” and said she was furious to see the “Trump Arms” near her home.



“To come out on my street and see this is outrageous, I am outraged.” she said.



When asked if she at least agreed the pub should be allowed to change its name, she said: “No, you wouldn’t have Hitler there would you? Would you say ‘Welcome Hitler’?”",politics
"President Trump is looking into revoking the security clearances of several top Obama-era intelligence and law enforcement officials, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday, accusing them of having ""politicized"" or ""monetized"" their public service.

She made the announcement at Monday's press briefing, after Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., called on the president to specifically revoke Trump critic and former CIA Director John Brennan's clearance.

In an interview with Fox News' ""The Story"" Monday night, Paul told host Martha MacCallum that Brennan ""should not get anywhere within 10,000 yards of the government. He should have a restraining order.""

""John Brennan leaked information that almost cost the life of a double agent. ... He should have been fired for that. But he wasn’t fired by President Obama because I think he was a partisan,"" Paul said. ""But now he’s a talking head on the outside, saying that basically President Trump should be executed – that’s what we do for treason. And so, yeah, I’m very concerned about him having privileges because of his past history.""

Paul added that he would go ""one step beyond"" the White House and remove top-secret clearances from all retired CIA agents and officers ""of any stripe.""

Sanders said Trump is also looking into the clearances for other former officials and Trump critics, including former FBI Director James Comey; former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe; former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper; former National Security Adviser Susan Rice and former CIA Director Michael Hayden (who also worked under President George W. Bush).

Sanders said Trump is “exploring mechanisms” to remove the security clearances “because [the former officials] politicized and in some cases actually monetized their public service and their security clearances in making baseless accusations of improper contact with Russia.”

Sanders added that their clearances effectively give “inappropriate legitimacy to accusations with zero evidence.”

“When you have the highest level of security clearance … when you have the nation’s secrets at hand, and go out and make false [statements], the president feels that’s something to be very concerned with,” Sanders said.

However, McCabe spokesperson Melissa Schwartz said his security clearance had already been deactivated when he was fired.

""Andrew McCabe's security clearance was deactivated when he was terminated, according to what we were told was FBI policy. You would think the White House would check with the FBI before trying to throw shiny objects to the press corps...,"" Schwartz tweeted Monday.

Benjamin Wittes, a friend of Comey’s, tweeted Monday afternoon that he texted the former FBI director, who told him he doesn’t have a security clearance to revoke. However, clearances can remain automatically ""active"" for several years after an official departs government service.

The Justice Department Office of the Inspector General declined to comment on Wittes' claims.

When asked whether former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden might have their security clearances revoked, Sanders said she did not have any further information.

The topic came into the spotlight Monday morning, with Paul’s tweets against the former CIA director.

“Is John Brennan monetizing his security clearance? Is John Brennan making millions of dollars divulging secrets to the mainstream media with his attacks on @realDonaldTrump?” Paul tweeted early Monday.

Brennan joined NBC News and MSNBC in February as a contributor and senior national security and intelligence analyst.

Late Monday, Nick Shapiro, a former CIA Deputy Chief of Staff under Brennan, said: ""John Brennan hasn't made one penny off of his clearance. Not one thing he has done for remuneration since leaving the government has been contingent on him having a security clearance.

""One doesn't need a security clearance to speak out against the failings of Trump,"" Shapiro added. ""This is a political attack on career national security officials who have honorably served their country for decades under both [Republicans] & [Democrats] in an effort to distract from [Special Counsel Robert] Mueller's investigation.""

Congressional Republicans are pushing for Brennan to testify on Capitol Hill regarding the investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.

The former CIA director has been a consistent and harsh critic of the president, blasting his performance with Putin in Helsinki as “nothing short of treasonous.”

But Brennan is not the only former intelligence official to take to the media world. In April, Comey began a media blitz promoting his new memoir, “A Higher Loyalty,” while Hayden and Rice also frequently make media appearances.

On Twitter, just minutes after the announcement from the White House briefing, Hayden responded in a tweet to several journalists that a loss of security clearance would not have an ""effect"" on him.

""I don't go back for classified briefings. Won't have any effect on what I say or write,"" Hayden tweeted.

"Army Gen. David Petraeus, who was instrumental in guiding U.S. troops during the Iraq War, says that America’s service members should be receiving assistance for the mounting medical issues that they fear have come as a result of being exposed to burn pits while stationed at military bases.

Petraeus, the former commander of U.S. Central Command and Multi-National Force-Iraq, said it’s time for the service members exposed to the dangers of burn pits -- and who say they have been abandoned by the Veterans Affairs Department and Washington – to be provided with proper care.

“It's a sacred obligation,” Petraeus, a retired four-star general, told Fox News during an exclusive interview at his Manhattan office. “And by and large, our country does an extraordinary amount for our veterans and for those who are serving in uniform, and for their families.”

“But comparing what our VA does to any other country's care of veterans...this is the gold standard. Certainly, a gold standard that can always improve, without question. This is an issue, though, where we have a sacred obligation, and we need to meet that obligation.”

The haphazard method of getting rid of trash, chemicals and even medical waste -- in open-air burn pits -- during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan generated numerous pollutants, including carbon monoxide and dioxin — the same chemical compound found in Agent Orange, the dangerous defoliant used during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971.

As early as Operation Desert Storm in 1991, burn pits were used on U.S. military bases in Iraq. At the height of the Iraq War in 2005, more than 300,000 troops were stationed there and potentially exposed to the smoke and fumes from burn pits. Estimates place the number of burn pits around that time at 63.

Thousands of veterans and former contractors returned from the Middle East and have developed cancer, respiratory problems and blood disorders from what they claim is their exposure to toxins from the flaming pits. More than 140,000 active-service members and retirees have put their names on a Burn Pit Registry created by the Veterans Administration.

Petraeus offered an explanation when asked about why burn pits were used on military bases, conceding that the realities of war kept concerns about how to dispose of waste a low priority at that time.

""At that time we weren't worried about burn pits. We were worried about just getting enough water for our troops in the really hot summer,"" he says. ""We were looking forward to the time where we might get some real food, real rations, as opposed to MREs and so forth.""

""This is an issue, though, where we have a sacred obligation, and we need to meet that obligation.” - General David Petraeus

The general explained how the rebuilding of Iraq’s infrastructure and the troop surge in 2007 were the high priorities at that time, but that the potential danger of burn pits was undeniable.

“They obviously fought us back. But over time, in that tour, in particular, you start noticing other issues,” Petraeus said. “So, yes, there is serious combat going on. But you’re noticing that there’s this massive burn pit that is up-wind of us. So it blows over this huge base, Camp Victory, where we had 25,000 or more soldiers based and stationed.”

“We had a number of other locations, again, where we had these burn pits. And you start to notice it more and more. And I got more and more concerned during that time -- I mean, it'd been something I'd noticed previously,” he said. “But now I realize that we've got all these soldiers who are, on really bad days, inhaling whatever it is that's being burned in these pits.”

Petraeus recalled during the sit-down that requests to install incinerators were made during the time of the surge and followed up when he moved to Central Command, but that it presented issues of its own.

“Well, it was something that had to be done for a long period of time,” he said of burn-pit disposal. “But at a certain point, it set in that perhaps there’s a better way of doing it.”

“Incinerators were actually brought in in some cases. And then there were even problems just getting incinerators to work. Unfortunately, sometimes it was easier still just to put it in a hole and burn it.”

Petraeus points out that our troops during that time were at what he calls a “survival stage” and many options did not exist to dispose of the massive amounts of waste generated on our military operations.

“You have to do something with that. And now it's way beyond just human waste,” he says. “It's also all of the byproducts of just daily life. And a lot of that gets dumped into a hole in the ground, and gasoline, or whatever it is -- poured on it, and someone -- torches it. And it's the way of disposing of what otherwise can no longer be buried.”

The general conceded that this crude method had persisted for a long time and that as bases grew in certain areas, burn pits also grew significantly.

“The results of those, this enormous plume of black smoke and so forth was very, very noticeable,” Petraeus recalled. “[W]hen the wind was blowing and the burn pit was in operation at a number of these different bases.”

“Needless to say, you'd try to put it so the wind wouldn't blow it over there. But the winds vary. And they changed. And there was never any perfect method to that.”

Since 2013, Petraeus has been with global investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts [KKR], where he serves as chair of their KKR Global Institute. He has also thrown his support behind efforts made in Washington to bring reform to the complicated process many veterans go through when they file a claim through the Veterans Administration.

In July, Petraeus sent a letter to Congress asking lawmakers to consider backing the Burn Pits Accountability Act – a recent bill brought before Capitol Hill by Reps. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and Brian Mast, R-Fla.

“I know that you share the sense of obligation that virtually all Americans have to those who have stepped forward at a time of war,” he wrote in the open letter.

While steps toward reform are underway, there still is cause for concern for our troops who are currently in Iraq.

A recent report from Fox News shows that burn pits are still being used in at least one military base in Iraq.

In a series of images obtained exclusively by Fox News, a burn pit near Camp Taji, Iraq, is seen spewing thick clouds of black smoke into the air on a near-daily basis. According to one soldier stationed at the base, the pits are set ablaze as many as five times a week. The images were taken on and around June 3.

The pits, seen in the pictures originally provided, are situated in a part of Camp Taji known as an “amber zone” — an area adjacent to U.S. Military operations where Iraqi National Forces operate. The soldier told Fox News that while the unit’s part of the camp is not using burn pits for trash disposal, it’s not exactly clear where their trash ends up.

When asked about his thoughts on the burning still going on so close to where U.S. troops are stationed, General Petraeus expressed trepidation when seeing photos of the pits being operated in Taji’s amber zone.

“It's actually the Iraqis who are using those now. But that still is a concern for us. And it should be,” he says. “I think as time has gone by we have come to realize that this is a bigger issue than clearly it was in the earlier years of these two wars.”

“And with that awareness, obviously we can certainly do a better job.”",world
"Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey will have big shoes to fill as he mulls over who he will appoint to temporarily fill the U.S. Senate seat of the late John McCain until a special election can be held to complete McCain's term.

McCain, 81, lost his year-long battle with brain cancer Saturday, leaving behind a decades-long legacy in politics which included presidential runs.

Even as he took a months-long hiatus from Washington to recover in his home state, McCain maintained a voice in Congress, sharing his opinion on legislation and frequently criticizing President Trump’s agenda.

McCain was one of the first to express opposition to Trump’s first presidential pardon in August 2017 of Joe Arpaio — the former sheriff of Arizona’s Maricopa County who was found guilty of a misdemeanor contempt-of-court charge in a trial prosecuted by the Justice Department.

A week earlier, McCain slammed Trump’s remarks surrounding last year's violence in Charlottesville, Va., writing in a tweet there’s ""no moral equivalency between racists & Americans standing up to defy hate & bigotry.""

In September 2017, McCain shocked his Republican colleagues with a thumbs-down vote against a replacement for ""Obamacare,"" the health care law approved under President Barack Obama.

“I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried,” McCain wrote, in part, after his dramatic vote. “I take no pleasure in announcing my opposition. Far from it. The bill’s authors are my dear friends, and I think the world of them. I know they are acting consistently with their beliefs and sense of what is best for the country. So am I.”

Trump signed a military policy bill in August named for McCain, but in a sign of their testy relationship the president made no mention of McCain's name in remarks at a signing ceremony.

Here’s what happens to Mccain’s Senate seat, according to Arizona election law.

Governor appoints a new senator

Arizona is one of 36 states where a governor makes an appointment to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Therefore, Gov. Ducey will appoint an interim senator to fill McCain’s seat.

Because McCain was a Republican, state law requires Ducey to appoint a member of the same party — a move that’s critically important for the Trump administration, as the GOP currently holds a bare 51-49 Senate majority.

The newly appointed senator would be in office until the next general election in November 2020. The interim senator would not be obligated to run in that election.

Whomever is elected to the Senate seat in November 2020 would complete McCain's term, which expires in January 2023.

What happens if the governor chooses a member of Congress?

If Ducey chooses one of the state’s current congressional members to fill the seat, then a special election would need to be held to fill that empty spot. According to the Arizona State Legislature, that election would have to be held “not less than 120 nor more than 133 days” after the vacancy occurs.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The world will be lonelier without John McCain.

DOOCY: One of McCain's best friends, former Senator Joe Lieberman, told mourners about the time McCain asked him to join the GOP ticket even though he was a registered Democrat.

JOHN LIEBERMAN, FORMER SENATOR: John's response was direct and really ennobling. That's the point, Joe, he said with a certain impatience. You are a Democrat, I'm a Republican. We could give our country the bipartisan leadership it needs for a change.

DOOCY: McCain's former political rivals spoke on his behalf too.

BUSH: In recent years, we sometimes talk about that intense period like football players remembering a big game. In the process, rivalry melted away.

OBAMA: So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty. John called on us to be bigger than that.

GRAHAM: Well, I'm doing OK. These things help. Thank you to everybody who has called and asked me how I'm doing. Cindy and everyone else around the family has helped me, as much I helped them, probably more so.

I'm going to say that nobody loved a soldier more than John McCain, that I bear witness to his commitment to have their back, travel where they go, never let them be forgotten. The public may be tired of this war called the war on terrorism, but John McCain never was. And he had their back and he gave them what they need to win a fight we can't afford to lose. And he was willing to lose a political race, but not a war. So, I'm going to talk about all my travels with the troops and how much they love John McCain.

WALLACE: I have to ask you about the passionate, heartfelt but sometimes angry tribute by Meghan McCain who took some pretty clear shots at President Trump. Here's a clip.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MEGHAN MCCAIN: We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness. The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.

GRAHAM: If you say something bad about Meghan's father, you will know it, she didn't like it. So, it's OK, she is grieving.

All I can say is there's a lesson to be learned this week about John McCain. Number one, Americans appreciate military service. If we've learned nothing this week you know the fact that John served our country in extraordinary circumstances. It was appreciated by everybody.

What else do we know? If you work hard and do your homework and know what you're talking about, people will listen to you. That if you pick big causes bigger than yourself, you'll be remembered.

He tried to drain the swamp before it was cool, that you can fight hard and still be respected. If you forgive, people appreciate it, and if you admit to mistakes, you look good as a stronger man. That's the formula, John McCain. This was a civics lesson for anybody who wanted to listen. Why do remember this man, because of the way he conducted his public life.

WALLACE: Do you think there's a lesson there for President Trump?

GRAHAM: There's a lesson here for everybody, including President Trump. Everybody makes mistakes. Those who admit it are seen by the public as bigger, not smaller. Know what you're talking about, fight hard, forgive, and have passion, strength and kindness are not mutually exclusive.

WALLACE: Let's turn to your day job and this week, you're going to be spending a lot of time as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh --

GRAHAM: Yes.

WALLACE: -- to be confirmed to the Supreme Court.

First of all, does he have the votes to win confirmation of the court?

GRAHAM: If he does well at the hearing he will get, my belief is 55 or higher. If he does well enough, I'm sure he will do well.

WALLACE: When you say 55, you've got to have 51 Republicans, with the appointment of McCain's replacement. So, you are saying as many as four Democrats?

GRAHAM: Well, that's 55. Last time I checked --

WALLACE: So, that's what you think.

GRAHAM: Yes. I'm not good at math, but yes, I think there are a handful of Democrats will vote for Judge Kavanaugh if he does well and maybe even more. A lot of people should vote for Judge Kavanaugh. If you are looking to a Republican president to pick a qualified conservative, he would be on the top of anyone's list including not just Donald Trump.

He's the one person I think every Republican president would see is the most qualified of their generation.

WALLACE: Democrats say that the confirmation should be delayed until we know whether or not there's going to be either a criminal prosecution of President Trump or impeachment proceedings against President Trump.

Here is Senator Dick Durbin, who was going to be on the program next.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. DICK DURBIN, D-ILL, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: We should be withholding this decision on the Supreme Court nominee until the air is cleared and we know exactly where we stand when it comes to this president and (INAUDIBLE)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Given that his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, says that candidate Trump in 2016 directed him to commit a crime, does the senator have a point?

GRAHAM: Well, it wasn't the point he had when Clinton was under investigation, we approved Justice Breyer. So, my Democratic friends did not have this view when Clinton was president.

WALLACE: We should point, I'm going to bring it up with Senator Durbin. 1994, Clinton is under investigation by the independent counsel in Whitewater and he was nominated.

GRAHAM: I think --

WALLACE: Stephen Breyer was confirmed to the court.

GRAHAM: Senator Grassley has been very fair. More documents than the person ever nominated to the Supreme Court. We're going to have a hearing and there's no drama in this hearing. The only drama is those running for president, how will they handle this hearing on the Democratic side? You know, we're going to get this good man confirmed.

WALLACE: Let me ask you, though, about this question of criminal liability. I want to look at some Kavanaugh's statements on that issue. Let's put them up. In 1999, Kavanaugh said the Nixon ruling, that President Nixon had to turn over all of the White House Watergate tapes may have been, quote, wrongly decided. In 2009, Kavanaugh wrote: criminal investigations take the president's focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people.

Is there a legitimate concern that Justice Kavanaugh, if you were faced with a case on the Supreme Court, would side with the president against either Congress or the court?

GRAHAM: Well, what I think you'll find is somebody that has had 308 decisions. So, you can get a pretty good idea of what he thinks based on his time on the court of appeals but the bottom line here is that most people are unsure as to whether or not a president can be indicted, a sitting president.

Impeachment is a process to remove a president, their criminal liability aspects are very much in debate. I think he's going to be mainstream in his thinking. He's going to look at both sides of the issue and decide appropriately.

WALLACE: One issue that pro-choice senators of both sides have pressed Kavanaugh on in their meetings with him on Capitol Hill is abortion. And Kavanaugh reportedly told them that Roe v. Wade is, quote, ""settled law"". Is that a firm commitment in your regard, in your view, to not overturn Roe? And if it is a firm commitment, how can you as a pro-life senator support him?

GRAHAM: I wouldn't vote for anybody that says that every decision the Supreme Court cannot be revisited. They revisit through a process. There's a process of overturning long precedent. There's a four-part test you have to apply.

From my point of view, what he will do is when that case comes, if it ever does, you just don't wake up one day and say, hey, I'd like to overturn Roe v. Wade. If there's a conflict that makes it to the Supreme Court, he will apply the test of precedent to that decision, Roe v. Wade, and every other precedent.

WALLACE: But to make it clear, you're saying you don't view his statement, for instance, to Senator Collins, a pro-choice Republican, that it settled law means that therefore it can't be re-examined and conceivably overturn?

GRAHAM: He would be disqualified, in my opinion, if you would not listen to both sides of the story and decide accordingly. This idea that Roe v. Wade is going to be challenged at state level, there are all kinds of laws out there. Some may work their way up to Supreme Court. He will give great deference I'm sure to Roe v. Wade. But it can be overturned like every other decision but that will be up to the facts on the record.

WALLACE: Senator Graham, thank you, thanks for your time on the tough weekend. Our deepest sympathies in a loss of a dear friend, sir.

GRAHAM: Thank you. Thank you so much.

Joining me now from Illinois, another member of the committee that will be questioning Judge Kavanaugh, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.

Senator, Democrats have tried a variety of efforts to upend and derail the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. I want to put some of them up.

The argument that there is a midterm election. The argument that President Trump is under investigation. If you want to see millions of pages of documents from when he was staff secretary for President George W. Bush, and the White House has no invoked executive privilege to withhold 100,000 pages from when he worked for the White House counsel.

I think it's fair to say that none of that has worked and the question is, why is it the Democrats have so far been unable to gain any traction against Judge Kavanaugh, and in the public debate, you don't seem to have laid a glove on him?

DURBIN: Let me say at the outset before we get into that and I will address it -- I joined with Lindsey Graham, every word he said John McCain John McCain. I respect John McCain so much and yesterday was a great display of the respect so many people across this country had for this great American. I was lucky enough to be with Lindsey and John involved in some very important negotiations for more than a year on comprehensive immigration reform. So I back up every word.

So let me start with Brett Kavanaugh in this way. He is the most unpopular Supreme Court nominee in the last 40 years. How did he reach that point so quickly? Well, I think there were a number of reasons for it.

You look at first and foremost is the fact that this president said I'm not going to put a man on the Supreme Court unless he is going to overturn Roe versus Wade and the Affordable Care Act. The president is never at a loss for words and he was very explicit in terms of what he wanted in a Supreme Court nominee. Those positions may be popular with his Republican base. They're not popular with the American people.

WALLACE: Wait, wait --

GRAHAM: An issue that you have raised --

WALLACE: Wait. I mean, he said he was going to appoint pro-life judges. He never said that he asked him or on a litmus test about that. And also, I have to say, I'm a little surprised that you are saying he's the most unpopular. When did we nominate and confirm Supreme Court justices based on public opinion polls?

DURBIN: Well, we shouldn't be. But you started off with the premise you've never laid a glove on him. The fact of the matter is the American people have gone through this nomination and come to the conclusion that he's not the right person for the job.

Let me go a little bit further here. He comes before us at a time when people are concerned about whether this president or any president is above the law. Think about his role, Kavanaugh's role, when it came to Judge Ken Starr going after President Clinton. He was the aggressive prosecutor in that respect and a few years later after working in the Bush White House said that completely reversed my position. A president should not be subject to the subject of prosecution while he's in office.

WALLACE: Can I -- can I let me just ask you about that because as Lindsey Graham brought up, and I was going to ask you anyway, in 1994, Bill Clinton was under investigation by an independent counsel on Whitewater and he nominated and the Senate confirmed Stephen Breyer and that was also in a midterm election year. That relate directly contradicts two of the arguments that you're making against Kavanaugh.

DURBIN: Let me just say that I was not a member of the Senate when Justice Breyer came before that body, but it will tell you at the time the investigation was underway, there was no suspicion at that moment that Clinton was going to brush it aside and say, you have no authority to even question me. It went forward. He was subpoenaed, he was deposed, he was tried in the House -- and I should say indicted under the impeachment clause and tried in the Senate. I was at the Senate at the time.

And now, we have a different situation completely. There is a serious question as to whether this president, given the opportunity, will end the Mueller investigation, something which most Republicans and the overwhelming majority of Americans say would be a serious mistake and we ask, of course, Judge Kavanaugh, what do you think, and he says it's hands off when it comes to a president during his term in office.

I think that's a mistake and it's one of the major reasons people had misgivings about his nomination.

WALLACE: Let's look at some specific issues. As I pointed out, Kavanaugh has told some pro-choice senators that he views Roe as settled law, he was asked about Obamacare, there's a Texas case that would try to take it all down because of the fact that the individual mandate has been repealed. He said that he was very skeptical of that.

Obviously, these aren't confirmed commitments. You wouldn't expect that from any judge.

Isn't it the real problem that this is a conservative judge, Donald Trump went to the country and promised to nominate conservative judges, originalists who would -- who would interpret the Constitution as written, it hasn't healed well within the mainstream, yes conservative, but within the judicial mainstream?

DURBIN: Well, you overlook one of the most important elements of his nomination, and that is the fact that there has been more concealment of documents concerning his public service and his position on issues than ever in the history of the United States.

WALLACE: He's given you half a million documents, sir.

(CROSSTALK)

DURBIN: Let me just make my point here, Chris. The assertion of executive privilege by the White House to take 100,000 documents and say the American people will not get a chance to see them as they reflect on Kavanaugh's background is the first time in history. This denial of access to documents violates a role that we thought was a tradition of the Senate under Senator Sessions and Senator Leahy, time and again when it came to Obama nominees.

They are suppressing these documents. If we are lucky we will see 6 percent, 6 percent, of all of the documents that have been produced -- that could be produced to reflect on Kavanaugh's true position on issues. He saying and the White House saying the American people have no right to know.

So, if he so proud of his conservative credentials show us the record, stand before us, trust the American people and they will trust you. I would say that to Judge Kavanaugh.

WALLACE: I -- and you will have the opportunity to do that starting on Tuesday. Let me just say as a point of saying goodbye, they have turned over half a million documents and the issue, part of it is about 3 million documents when he was staff secretary and every document that went to the president went to his desk.

But, Senator Durbin, thank you. Thanks for joining us. We look forward to your questioning of Judge Kavanaugh starting this week.

DURBIN: Thanks, Chris.

WALLACE: Always good to talk with you, sir.

Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what to expect from this week's showdown between the president's Supreme Court pick and Senate Democrats.

Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about how Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation would change the Supreme Court? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: We need to elect senators who will vote for judges to follow our laws and our Constitution as written.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump on the campaign trail this week making the case for his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court and it's time now for our Sunday group.

Former press secretary for Vice President Pence, Marc Lotter, Charles Lane of ""The Washington Post"", former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and ""Washington Post"" columnist and former White House speechwriter Marc Thiessen.

Chuck, when Justice Kennedy, the swing vote on the court, stepped down and there was talk about replacing him, we heard all this talk about a fierce battle for the future of the court and I want to ask you the same question that I asked Senator Durbin, why hasn't it happen? The Democrats don't seem to have gained much traction against Brett Kavanaugh so far.

CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: I think there's a lot of reasons, starting with the fact that it's just possible Republicans care a little bit more about this than actually Democrats do. I did a little checking and Democrats were a little bit less likely than Republicans to vote in 2016 based on the future of the Supreme Court. So, there's a little bit of a surprising passion gap there.

Secondly, I think it's the very simple fact that this is about 51 votes and the Republicans have 51 votes, and that means two things, one, Mitch McConnell can control the pace of this thing, control the calendar and so forth. And secondly, it means the Democrats are just struggling to get over that work and they are divided. Not divided down the middle, but they are divided between the main block of the party and several people who have to run for reelection in red states.

That's created a very difficult problem in messaging for them and so they are left dealing not with the substance of the Kavanaugh thing but procedural issues like document disclosure, arcane matters, very important but very arcane about executive privilege and the net effect is they have yet to identify some hot button things that can get the public excited against Judge Kavanaugh.

WALLACE: We ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on Twitter from Waris Waldo, which after I read it several times realize some persons interpretation of where is Waldo.

When did adhering to the United States Constitution became radical and threatening?

Marc Lotter, how do you answer that?

MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I think that's the basis of this argument. And we have -- and Judge Kavanaugh and in Justice Gorsuch -- we have someone who adheres to the Constitution and many on the liberal side prefer to appoint justices who interpret the law to mean things other than what it says. That's the heart of the argument.

WALLACE: I want to turn to the nation's farewell to John McCain which has been the big story this week and his daughter Meghan's tribute to him at the National Cathedral yesterday, which still has a lot of people talking. Here's part of that.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MEGHAN MCCAIN: The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.

(APPLAUSE)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Marc Thiessen, it's her dad.

MARC THIESSEN, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE SPEECHWRITER: Yes.

WALLACE: She obviously feels passionately about the fact that she thinks that President Trump didn't treat her dad well and he didn't, what did you think of her remarks?

THIESSEN: Well, first of all, just watching her this week has been heartbreaking because her grief has been palpable and so was her anger palpable yesterday and with good reason because Donald Trump treated her father disgracefully.

If you want to put this in perspective, there have been 1,974 United States senators since the founding of the republic. John McCain is only the sixth senator to lie in state who wasn't either a vice president or president. So, this is a tremendous testament and there are only 31 people in American history who had laid in state.

This may very well be the first time that the sitting president of the United States has not participated in honoring that person, and that as a result of his disgraceful behavior towards him. He was even criticizing John McCain by name a few weeks ago on the campaign trail to suggest that he wasn't a war hero and never apologized for that.

This is one of the reasons, Chris, why I think Donald Trump, despite a booming economy, his disapproval has reached now 60 percent in the country. It's not because people don't like his policies, because his policies are obviously improving the lives of people, the economy is booming and on employment is low. But his inability to be presidential and to rise to the occasion at a moment like this, put aside his petty grievances against John McCain, I think that's one of the reasons why his popularity doesn't match his success as president.

WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, I promise I'm going to bring one but Marc Lotter is out someone often defends this president. Your reaction?

LOTTER: Well, I think it takes two to tango. And I think John McCain and Senator McCain has made a very good career out of attacking presidents when he disagreed on both sides of the aisle.

WALLACE: But in fairness, he somehow had a good enough relationship with George W. Bush and Barack Obama that they spoke at his funeral.

LOTTER: And he did. This is one that continued on this week. And I think once we get past this, we will remember John McCain for all of his great service. The president is going to continue to go on and is going to do many things that John McCain supported like supporting our troops, investing in our military and we'll let their -- we'll let their disagreement I guess go on in history.

WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to Meghan McCain's remarks and when you take in addition, because it wasn't just McCain, it was Joe Biden and it was Barack Obama, and it was George W. Bush, the last Republican president before Trump. Was this week a rebuke of President Trump?

DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, D-MD.: Well, I think that Meghan McCain's remarks and all of the remarks of the various speakers were John McCain speaking. His hand was clearly evident in those remarks and particularly Meghan's remarks and I think that there were spot on for where we are in this nation.

You know, I come from a military family too and I think for the president of the United States not to have honored and recognized Senator McCain's service, irrespective of policy disagreement I think was disgraceful and I think the nation stood up and said that it was disgraceful too. And that all of those speakers indicated that what was valued and Senator McCain in addition to his service in his honor was his commitment to this country and that we had a president of the United States who seemed incapable of even acknowledging that.

WALLACE: All right. We're going to leave it on that note. Panel, we will take a break here. We'll see you a little later.

Up next, President Trump threatens to cut Canada out of a new NAFTA deal and forge ahead just with Mexico. What would that mean for workers in the economy?

On this Labor Day weekend, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka joins us next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, President Trump looks to replace NAFTA as he works on a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: And we're going to call it the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement. And we'll get rid of the name NAFTA.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll talk with the head of the largest group of unions in the country, Richard Trumka, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Negotiations to hammer out a deal to reshape NAFTA, the three nation trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, will continue this weeks after talks between the White House and Canada stalled amid some bitterness.

Joining us now to discuss the potential fallout for American workers is the president of the AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.

Mr. Trumka, President Trump has negotiated a new NAFTA deal with Mexico, but talks with Canada stalled after some off the record comments that he made were published that he acknowledged that he won't make any concessions to Canada. And here's what he said about that afterwards.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Here's the good news, at least Canada knows where I stand, because we can't have these countries taking advantage of the United States anymore. It's very simple.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Question, can you support a deal that leads Canada out of a new NAFTA and will Congress pass it?

RICHARD TRUMKA, AFL-CIO PRESIDENT: Well, Chris, before I get to that, just let me say, on behalf of the hardworking men and women of this country who wake our country up every day, make her run all day and put it to bed at night, let me wish you a happy Labor Day and all your listeners a happy Labor Day.

Look, our economies are integrated, the three countries in North America, the economy is pretty emigrated. And it's pretty hard to see how that would work without having Canada in the deal. You said that the Mexican deal is close, but there's still a lot of work to be left -- to be done, even on the Mexican deal, Chris, because the language isn't drafted. We haven't seen whole chapters of the thing. We're anxious to move forward with it and anxious to have all three countries involved, because NAFTA has had a devastating effect on the working people of this country for the last 25 years. So we've been aggressively pursuing an agreement that works for the workers in all three countries and I can say we're not done yet.

WALLACE: OK, but let's talk about the parts of the deal we do know about that the Trump administration has negotiated with Mexico that it seems to me would be pretty good for workers. Let's put them up on the screen.

Seventy-five percent of a car's value would have to be manufactured in North America. That's up from 62.5 percent. Forty to forty-five percent of the car must be made by workers in whatever country earning at least $16 an hour.

Do you support both of those provisions and, frankly, do you think that Mexico would live up to them? For instance, the salary for car workers, because in Mexico right now the salary for a car worker on average is $3 an hour. Do you think they actually are going to boost that to $16 an hour?

TRUMKA: Well, first of all, those provisions can be very, very good. And you said that the current provision is really 62.5. In actuality, Chris, it's only in the 40s because they -- they do a little cheating saying if you put in 62 percent and China puts in 38 percent, it counts as 100 percent. So it's really lower and the change is really more -- more effective. We haven't seen the details of it yet.

But you hit the nail right on the head. It doesn't matter what's in that agreement. If we can't monitor it and effect it -- and enforce it effectively, then the agreement will fail for workers and it will fail for the country. So what we're pushing right now, and we're working with Ambassador Lighthizer is, is a way to let us effectively monitor what's going on the ground and then enforce the agreement regardless of who's in the White House, because we've been told for over 25 years, trust us, this agreement will be good for workers. What we need is an agreement that we can enforce no matter who's in the White House.

WALLACE: Let me --

TRUMKA: That's what we're looking for.

WALLACE: Let me step back for a minute and go broader view.

How does big labor feel about President Trump at this point? I mean the fact is growth is up. Unemployment is down. He's using tariffs to try to break down trade barriers that I know that you hate. So, I mean, what mark do you give Donald Trump on this Labor Day weekend?

TRUMKA: Well, when he was elected, I said I would call balls and strikes. When he did something that was good for workers, we'd support him. When he did something that was bad for workers, we would oppose him.

Unfortunately, to date, the things that he's done to hurt workers outpace what he's done to help workers. He hasn't come up with an infrastructure program that could put a lot of us back to work. He overturned a regulation that would actually denied over 5 million people overtime that they would have had. He overturned some health and safety regulations that will hurt us on the job. Enforcement of OSHA and MSHA isn't what it should be.

So we keep trying to find areas where we can work with him. And where we can, we do.

WALLACE: Well, but let me ask you -- Mr. Trumka, let me ask you, I mean, 3.9 percent unemployment. 3.5 million jobs created, 4 percent -- 4.2 percent GDP in the last quarter. I mean don't you give him something for that?

TRUMKA: No, those are good, but wages have been down since the first of the year. Gas prices have been up since the first of the year. So, overall, workers aren't doing as well. He passed the tax bill that encourages companies to outsource. We can't agree to support something like that. He's -- every place we can, Chris, we do. But, unfortunately, right now, the scale is weighted against him because he's done more to hurt workers than to help workers.

WALLACE: So you have launched a new big political campaign for the midterms. You have an ad out on the web right now. Is it your hope that Democrats would take back control of the House and Senate and block the Trump agenda, even those parts that have been good for workers, like creating 3.5 million new jobs?

TRUMKA: It's not about Democrats or Republicans. It's about electing people who will support working people in this country. That's what we're looking to do.

We started a couple of months ago, going door-to-door, member to member with our members saying, what issues are important to you? We put those together. We're going to put them in front of candidates. Those candidates that support the issues that our members say they want, need and should have are the candidates that we'll support.

It probably will be Democrats because, unfortunately, Democrats support working people more than Republicans have. We'd like to change that. But the reality is, Democrats support working people more than Republicans, although we go candidate by candidate and we support those Republicans that support working people.

WALLACE: Finally, this week I looked at the presidential exit polls from 2016. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in union households by just nine points, 51 percent to 42, which interestingly enough is the smallest Democratic advantage since Reagan ran against Mondale in 1984. Question, don't a lot of your members, union members, don't they support Donald Trump?

TRUMKA: Well, actually, three percentage points more of our members voted for Donald Trump than they did for Mitt Romney. Unfortunately, 10 percent of our members -- 10 percent fewer of our members voted for Hillary Clinton. They didn't believe her on trade. They didn't believe her on a couple of other issues.

But you talked about households. Union members themselves are a much higher percentage in there. Again, we give them all the facts and I believe in my membership, the rank and file, that when they get the facts, they make the right decision every time. We're giving them the facts on this president and anybody who's running against him and they will ultimately decide which one of those candidates that they want to support.

WALLACE: Mr. Trumka, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of this Labor Day holiday weekend with us. We'll stay on top of all this, sir.

TRUMKA: Chris, thanks for having me on. And, again, happy Labor Day.

WALLACE: When we come back, the Trump administration opens the door to regulating Google. Our Sunday panel returns to discuss the battle with big tech. That's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if they don't.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump playing hardball with Canada as he tries to rewrite the quarter century old North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.

And we're back now with the panel.

Well, Congresswoman Edwards, there was a lot of howling, I think it's fair to say, from Democrats when President Trump said that he was going to revamp NAFTA. But aren't there, and it talked about it with Mr. Trumka, aren't there a number of provisions in this agreement with Mexico at least that are good for American workers?

EDWARDS: Well, I think there are also a lot of Democrats who very much wanted to see a North American Free Trade Agreement that really invests in workers, that makes sure that we have protections across both borders. And I think you heard that from what Mr. Trumka was saying. And I -- you know, I think it --

WALLACE: But raising -- but raising the wage to $16 an hour?

EDWARDS: Raising the wages. Exactly.

WALLACE: Raising the amount that has to be content from North America?

EDWARDS: Right. And all -- those are -- those are actually things that many of us is Democrats have been calling for, for a long time because, you know, we can have free trade, but if it's not fair on both sides of the border, it really doesn't work. It doesn't keep workers here working and it doesn't make sure that workers in Mexico are being paid what they need. And I don't think you can have a North American Free Trade Agreement without having the other part of North America, which is Canada, in the deal too.

WALLACE: Let me pick up on that with you, Marc Lotter, because talks with Canada stalled on Friday over it seems to issues, one is continued dairy protections inside Canada and, secondly, the publishing of off the record comments by President Trump where he basically said, I'm not going to offer any concessions at all to Canada. Does this deal go through? And -- and I'm primarily, I guess, I'm talking about Congress, does this deal go through without Canada onboard?

LOTTER: I think it makes it much easier if Canada is on board to get it through Congress. But this is -- this is very tough negotiating with the president and the prime minister and the Canadian officials. The president is very clear, he wants to get this done. He wants Canada to be involved. And it's going to be a question now of, can they make enough concessions to make it fair on both sides? I think they will.

WALLACE: Let's turn to another big story this week and that is President Trump complaining that Google's search engine, when you put in ""President Trump news,"" it has been calibrated to drown out conservative voices. The president and his team this week complained about that and even talked about regulating Google.

Here's the president.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: I've made it clear that we, as a country, cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting and rigged search results.

We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and learn from. We can't do that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Chuck, first of all, from the best of your knowledge, is there political bias in the Google search? I mean is it calibrated to drown out conservative voices and to push liberal points of view? And, secondly, what do you make of the threat by the president that the government might get involved in regulating Google?

LANE: Well, the best of my knowledge about Google's algorithms is not very good.

WALLACE: Well, that's why I asked you. (INAUDIBLE).

LANE: But I -- I would be very surprised if somebody at Google said, let's set up the algorithm to drown out Donald Trump in any specific sense like that. I think these searches work in an incredibly complex ways that for some unconscious or otherwise neutral reason may be turning up what President Trump claims they're turning up. But, of course, it's just his claim.

But there's a bigger context for this, which is, a lot of stuff going on at Google, like a few months back an employee circulating a memo internally claiming that the company isolates conservatives internally, then he winds up on the outs. There's a movement within Google to decouple Google, so to speak, from defense contracting and so forth. And I think the president's pushing back against those things and he's more generally trying to turn Google into just another part of this big, fake news media that has been his big foil all through his political career.

You know, there's a lot of suspicion, both on the left and the right, in sort of populist America about these giant technology companies. And I think in that sense, he's just trying to turn them into another one of his scapegoats to show like everything is stacked against us, even the search engine.

WALLACE: Marc, your thoughts about whether the government should be regulating a company like Google? Are their First Amendment issues there? And if they were (ph) going to regulate Google in terms of its search engine, they can do a number of things just to make life difficult for Google.

THIESSEN: No doubt. And I -- look, I think the - - the fact that there -- there is conservative bias in social media. It's not just Google. It's FaceBook. It's Twitter. There's been a lot of accusations. They probably -- the only place where there's more anti- conservative bias than the legacy media is Silicon Valley. So, you know, and the fact is, a lot of people getting their news from Silicon Valley in a ways that they weren't a few years ago. But -- and so Trump is raising a valid point.

Where he loses me is when he says that he wants the government to start regulating it, because I -- the only institution I trust less than Google to regulate my -- my search is the federal government. So I think what we need is for people to be more proactive in terms of where they get their news and how they -- they consume their news.

One of the -- the -- the avenue of social media has given conservatives an incredible voice that they didn't have before because they didn't have to go through ""The Washington Post"" and ""The New York Times."" So they have a voice that they never had before. But we're also in these ideological silos were conservatives only read conservative news sources. Liberals only read -- Washington (ph) read liberal news sources. And I think we all need to do a better job of policing ourselves and getting out of our silos and listening to the other side because that's how we get over the division in the country.

WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, I want to pick up on the last point that Chuck made, and that is, isn't there a legitimate concern -- and on this populist issue about companies, whether it's Google or FaceBook or Twitter or Amazon, these huge companies that have so much power and so much money and so much influence?

EDWARDS: Well, I mean, but the concern, I think, is really misplaced because if you look at these entities, every time there, you know, is this sort of massive growth in this industry, something else starts up that becomes the next new thing. And we remember when Twitter was the next new thing and Instagram the next new thing. And so I think that the dynamism that's in the industry allows that to, you know, to create an environment where, you know, you can have a lot of different kinds of voices in there. And I think if anything is getting in the way of it in terms of the government, I think it's saying, you know, this -- these decisions around net neutrality because then that makes it even more difficult for conservative or even, you know, far left views to get into the mainstream if you're put on this secondary highway.

So -- but the idea that the government should have the -- the -- the ability to figure out what the search engine is, I don't think so. I mean most of the people I know in Congress can't even operate their Twitter handle.

WALLACE: I am remaining silent in this conversation. I'm -- I'm a luddite, which go to Google and look up what it means.

Thank you panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" Dolly Parton on why kids around the world call her ""the book lady.""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Most of us know her as a legendary singer and songwriter, but as we told you back in March, for millions of kids, she's the one who help them start reading early.

Here is our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DOLLY PARTON, FOUNDER, IMAGINATION LIBRARY: I just always thought there was magic in books because it takes you to other places. Anywhere you want to go, you can find it in a book.

It says Dolly Parton, that's my name.

WALLACE (voice over): The Library of Congress is not the first place you'd expect to see Dolly Parton, but there she was celebrating her love of books.

PARTON (singing): In my Tennessee mountain home --

WALLACE: It's a story that begins back when she was growing up, one of 12 children, in the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee, the daughter of Robert Lee Parton.

PARTON: Daddy never had a chance to go to school. And daddy couldn't read nor write, but he was really a smart person enough and wondered what all he might have done had he had an education.

WALLACE: Fast-forward to 1995, when the country music star decided to start the Imagination Library, to give free books to children in her hometown.

Over the years, the program has spread across the country and overseas. A book every month to kids who sign up from birth until they turn five and go to kindergarten.

WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to a child to get their own book mailed to them in their own name?

PARTON: It makes them feel important. It makes them feel special. So, of course, it makes them want to do what the book is all about, learn to read it.

WALLACE (voice over): Local communities pay for the books, but Dolly's group pays for sending out more than a million a month, which she helps cover through her companies and concerts and even a children's album.

PARTON (singing): I am a rainbow.

PARTON: Oh, millions of dollars, I'm sure.

WALLACE (on camera): And it's that important to you?

PARTON: Oh, it's very important, because it's my charity. Although there are many things that I do, this is the one that's nearest and dearest to my heart.

WALLACE (voice over): Dolly has been performing for more than 60 years. She's won eight Grammy's and is in the Country Music Hall of Fame. But she shows no sign at all of slowing down.

PARTON: My music is everything to me. It's my gift. It's my joy. It's my job. And it's just something that I love to do. And I never think about that I should quit it.

WALLACE: Which brings us back to the Imagination Library.

WALLACE (on camera): Though I understand that you have gotten a nickname from this program.

PARTON: I'm the book lady. Who knew?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are so honored that the hundred millionth book --

WALLACE (voice over): So there was Dolly with the librarian of Congress donating the 100 millionth book, unveiling a copy of her own ""Coat of Many Colors,"" based on the coat her mother made for her out of scraps of cloth.

PARTON: Maybe we'll be back for our billionth book one of these days.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right.

PARTON: Wouldn't that be nice!

WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you, Library of Congress?

PARTON: I know. Here I am. A little old country girl from the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee. Now one of my little books about my mom and a story about my dad is going to be here forever in the Library of Congress.

WALLACE (voice over): Dolly even gave us a little concert about the coat and her family and what led her to share her dream with so many children.

PARTON (singing): In my coat of many colors that my mama made for me, made only from rags but I wore it so proudly. And although we had no money, I was rich as I could be, in my coat of many colors mama made for me, because she made it just for me.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Dolly's Imagination Library now teams up with the Library of Congress for a special story time for kids, the last Friday of each month streaming online.

And speaking of kids, I want to introduce you to a special one. Jack Henry Wallace, who was born on Friday, 8 pounds 6 ounces. Jack will make his television debut in December as part of our annual Christmas greeting from now the six Wallace grandkids. Jack, his mom and dad, and, yes, his proud grandpa are all doing well.

"Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime personal attorney, admitted Tuesday to violating federal campaign finance laws by arranging hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal “at the direction” of then-candidate Trump.

In entering the plea, Cohen did not specifically name the two women or even Trump, recounting instead that he worked with an “unnamed candidate.” But the amounts and the dates all lined up with the payments made to Daniels and McDougal.

In total, Cohen pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion, one count of making false statements to a financial institution, one count of willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count of making an excessive campaign contribution.

Cohen could have received up to 65 years in prison if convicted of all charges. However, as part of his plea deal, Cohen agreed not to challenge any sentence between 46 and 63 months. The deal does not involve a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors.

Cohen is set to be sentenced Dec. 12.

In a statement, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said: “There is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the President in the government’s charges against Mr. Cohen. It is clear that, as the prosecutor noted, Mr. Cohen’s actions reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time.”

Cohen attorney Lanny Davis said his client had pleaded guilty “so that his family can move on to the next chapter.

""This is Michael fulfilling his promise made on July 2nd to put his family and country first and tell the truth about Donald Trump,"" Davis added. ""Today he stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election. If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn’t they be a crime for Donald Trump?""

Separately, Davis told Fox News that Cohen’s involvement in the Trump-Russia investigation does not end with the plea deal, but in fact ""it is only the beginning.""

Davis added that Cohen will speak with whoever is investigating the president to make sure the truth about Trump gets out.

Cohen’s home, office and hotel room were raided in April by federal investigators looking into his financial dealings, including his alleged practice of paying women to stay silent about claims they had affairs with now-President Trump. Daniels and McDougal have both claimed they had sex with Trump while he was married, which the president denies.

Cohen was behind the $130,000 payment to Daniels, and recently released a tape of a conversation from September 2016 of him and Trump discussing the possible payment to McDougal.

Trump denied to reporters in April that he knew anything about Cohen’s payments to Daniels, though the explanation from the president and Giuliani have shifted multiples times since.

In May, Giuliani initially told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Trump had reimbursed Cohen for the payment to Daniels. Giuliani later claimed that the president was unaware the money would be going to Daniels and said Trump repaid Cohen for unspecified “expenses.”

Deputy U.S. Attorney Robert Khuzami told reporters that in January 2017, Cohen had begun seeking reimbursement for the payments to both women by “submitting invoices to the candidate’s company” — believed to be the Trump Organization — that falsely indicated that Cohen had provided legal services in the year 2017.

“In fact ... [Cohen] provided no legal services for the year 2017, and it was simply a means to obtain reimbursement for the unlawful campaign contribution,” Khuzami said.

According to prosecutors, Cohen sent reimbursement invoices to “one or more” members of the Trump Organization requesting $35,000 per month.

The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2016 that McDougal was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc. -- the parent company to the National Enquirer — for the rights to the story, but it never ran.

According to court documents, Cohen reached an agreement with “Chairman-1” — believed to be American Media Chairman and CEO David Pecker — to pay $125,000 for “the rights to the non-disclosure portion” of McDougal’s agreement with American Media. Prosecutors say Cohen created a shell entity, “Resolution Consultants LLC” to execute the transaction.

An agreement was signed, but according to prosecutors, “Chairman-1” contacted Cohen in early October 2016 before any money could be exchanged and told him ""that the deal was off and that Cohen should tear up the assignment agreement."" The documents say that Cohen did not do so and the agreement was found during the April search of his office.

Cohen also admitted Tuesday to underreporting his income by $4.1 million on his tax returns for the years between 2012 and 2016. Of that amount, $2.5 million was interest payments from a personal loan; $1.3 million was income from his taxi medallion business; $100,000 was income from brokerage commissions; and $200,000 was from “consulting fees.”

The investigation into Cohen was handled by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York after it was referred to them by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office.

Trump has repeatedly blasted developments in the Cohen investigation. In April, after Cohen’s offices were raided, he declared “attorney-client privilege is dead.” Last month, he slammed both the FBI raid and Cohen’s taping of discussions about paying McDougal as “inconceivable.”

“Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of,” he tweeted. “Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal.”

But, possibly in reference to questions about whether he had violated any campaign finance laws, Trump added that “your favorite President did nothing wrong!”

Before the election, Cohen had been a trusted member of the Trump organization, working out of an office in Trump Tower next to one used by his boss.

He raised millions for Trump’s campaign and, after being interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee last year, told Vanity Fair that Trump had no part in the suspected Russian conspiracy to tamper with the election.

However, Cohen appeared to distance himself from Trump last month. In an interview with ABC News, which was referenced by Davis Tuesday, Cohen said that “my wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will. I put family and country first.”

"President Trump announced Thursday that he was canceling a pay raise due to most civilian federal employees in January, citing budgetary reasons.

In a letter to congressional leaders, the president wrote that locality pay increases would cost $25 billion. Those increases would come on top of a 2.1 percent across-the-board increase for most civilian employees.

""We must maintain efforts to put our Nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases,"" Trump wrote before announcing that for 2019, ""both across-the-board pay increases and locality pay increases will be set at zero.""

""These alternative pay plan decisions will not materially affect our ability to attract and retain a well‑qualified Federal workforce,"" Trump's letter adds.

The Democratic National Committee described Trump's letter as ""yet another slap in the face to American workers"" by the president, while Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., called it ""the latest attack in the Trump Administration’s war on federal employees.

""The President and his party, which controls both houses of Congress, have had every chance over the last 18 months to get serious about tackling our fiscal challenges,"" Warner said in a statement. ""Instead, the President ballooned the deficit by trillions of dollars with a tax giveaway primarily benefitting [sic] big business and the wealthiest Americans. I can think of nothing more hypocritical or disingenuous than to turn around and throw hardworking federal employees under the bus on the pretext of fiscal responsibility.""

Under the law, the 2.1 percent raise takes effect automatically unless the president and Congress act to change it. Congress is currently debating a proposal for a slightly lower, 1.9 percent across-the-board raise to be included in a government funding bill that would require Trump's signature to keep most government functions operating past September.

Unions representing the 2 million-member federal workforce urged Congress to pass the 1.9 percent pay raise.

""President Trump's plan to freeze wages for these patriotic workers next year ignores the fact that they are worse off today financially than they were at the start of the decade,"" said J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents some 700,000 federal workers.

""They have already endured years of little to no increases and their paychecks cannot stretch any further as education, health care costs, gas and other goods continue to get more expensive,"" added Tim Reardon, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union.

Cox said federal worker pay and benefits have been cut by more than $200 billion since 2011, and workers are currently earning 5 percent less than they did at the start of the decade.

In July, the Trump administration sharply revised upward its deficit estimates compared to the estimates in the budget proposal it sent Congress in February. The worsening deficit reflects the impact of the $1.5 trillion, 10-year tax cut, as well as increased spending for the military and domestic programs that Congress approved earlier this year.

The administration's July budget update projected a deficit of $890 million for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, up from the February estimate of $873 billion. The $890 billion deficit projection represents a 34 percent increase from the $666 billion deficit the government recorded in 2017.

For 2019, the administration is projecting the deficit will once again top $1 trillion and stay at that level for the next three years.

The only other period when the federal government ran deficits above $1 trillion was the four years from 2009 through 2012, when the government used tax cuts and increased spending to combat the 2008 fiscal crisis and the worst economic downturn since the 1930s.

"Sen. John McCain said Friday that the U.S.-Russia summit in Helsinki “should not move forward” unless President Trump is willing to hold Russia accountable for political meddling. This, after 12 Russian intelligence officers were indicted for allegedly hacking emails from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party in the 2016 election.

The Republican senator from Arizona released a statement praising the charges, which arose out of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the election.

The 12 members belonging to the Russian Intelligence agency are accused of hacking into emails from the Hillary campaign and her party, and of leaking damaging discussions between top party members.

“Today’s indictment is a result of the hard work of America’s law enforcement and intelligence officials who dedicate their lives to bringing to justice those who wish to do us harm,” McCain, who has been sidelined while battling cancer, said in a statement.

“These revelations add to a body of evidence confirming an extensive plot by Vladimir Putin’s government to attack the 2016 election, sow chaos and dissension among the American electorate, and undermine faith in our democracy.”

McCain has been a vocal critic of Trump, recently calling his visit to the NATO summit in Brussels “disappointing.”

While not expressing outright support for the meeting with Russia, which is to take place on Monday, McCain said Thursday that that summit represented an opportunity for Trump “to demonstrate his willingness to defend America” against its adversaries.

“Putin is not America’s friend. … Putin is America’s enemy,” McCain said.

He doubled down on that sentiment on Friday, urging Trump to hold the Russian president “accountable.”

“President Trump must be willing to confront Putin from a position of strength and demonstrate that there will be a serious price to pay for his ongoing aggression towards the United States and democracies around the world,"" the senator said. ""If President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward.”

Trump and Putin will meet in their first official standalone meeting on Monday at the Presidential Palace in Finland. The pair have met twice before, on the sidelines of international meetings.

On Friday, several Democratic leaders also weighed in, in some instances urging the president to consider canceling his summit with Putin.

Sen. Mark Warner, top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, offered Trump an ultimatum for the highly anticipated summit: make Russian interference a priority, or cancel the meeting.

"President Trump should award John McCain, who died on Saturday, the Medal of Honor. The posthumous award would recognize the senator’s extraordinary heroism during his five years of captivity in North Vietnam, when he was tortured mercilessly, leaving him disabled for life. The compassionate and respectful gesture might also help to heal some deep wounds in the Republican Party.

McCain was a Navy fighter pilot when his plane was shot down on a mission over the North Vietnamese capital of Hanoi in 1967. He fractured both arms and one leg when he was ejected from his jet and nearly drowned when he parachuted into a lake. North Vietnamese pulled the badly injured McCain from the lake and attacked him. One bayonetted him and crushed his shoulder with a rifle butt.

McCain was routinely beaten by his captors once he was imprisoned, in part because he refused to accept early release, offered once the North Vietnamese realized he was the son of a Navy admiral and wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes. McCain refused to leave until the U.S. POWs captured before him went home first.

Because of his 23 bombing raids over North Vietnam and the leadership he showed in the infamous so-called Hanoi Hilton – McCain received the Silver Star, Legion of Merit, three Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart.

John McCain deserves the Medal of Honor, our nation’s highest military award. President Trump would acknowledge the senator’s extraordinary service to our country and at the same time demonstrate his respect by bestowing it on one of his fiercest critics.

John McCain deserves the Medal of Honor, our nation’s highest military award. President Trump would acknowledge the senator’s extraordinary service to our country and at the same time demonstrate his respect by bestowing it on one of his fiercest critics. It is by honoring our adversaries that we ourselves gain in stature.

The 81-year-old senator from Arizona and former Republican presidential candidate was a true American hero, one who by turns elevated the country’s discourse and exasperated his friends and foes alike.

Though he regularly sparred with Democrats – including President Obama, whom he once dismissed as a “celebrity,” and Secretaries of State John Kerry and Hillary Clinton – those on the left forgave him when he became one of President Trump’s most damaging political adversaries.

The enemy of my enemy…

The death of John McCain is a tragic loss for his family and for the millions who revered his old-style politics, his occasional forays across the aisle, his downright cussedness and his extraordinary wartime valor and patriotism.

There are far too few people in the public eye today who have earned our respect, and even fewer willing to buck their party by standing up for principle.

It is also a tragedy that McCain died at a time when his antagonism toward President Trump and his opposition to a seven-year effort to repeal ObamaCare had caused him to lose the admiration of millions.

Arguably, Donald Trump initiated the bad blood. As a candidate during the GOP presidential primaries, Trump said that McCain was “not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.”

It was an appalling comment. Many thought the inexcusable remark would end Trump’s run for the White House, but it instead became one of many outrages overlooked by voters fed up with the status quo and looking for a brawler to fight for their interests.

Still, it turned out to be a costly comment for Trump, the GOP and the country.

In the early hours of July 28, 2017, McCain delivered his famous thumbs-down on the Republican effort to repeal most elements of ObamaCare, causing the measure to fail on a 51-49 vote.

At the time, McCain tweeted: “Skinny repeal fell short because it fell short of our promise to repeal & replace Obamacare w/ meaningful reform.”

The bill McCain toppled was indeed a terrible piece of legislation. Many in the Senate voted for it only after House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., promised it would never become law, but rather would be reworked through a House-Senate conference committee into a better bill.

Nonetheless, McCain’s last-minute vote was a stunning blow to his party, his voters and, certainly, to his president. It was a shock to his close friend, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who had patiently spearheaded the repeal effort.

McCain also voted several months later against the Cassidy-Graham bill, which was a much better approach to replacing ObamaCare, targeting the bloated federal government and sending health-care dollars back to the states. The proposed law was crafted in part by his best friend in the Senate, Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

Not only did McCain torpedo his colleagues’ efforts to follow through on a campaign promise, he voted twice to preserve ObamaCare, which was especially harmful to his own state. As he himself wrote, “in my home state of Arizona … premiums are skyrocketing and health care providers are fleeing the marketplace.”

In that statement, McCain called for hearings to consider legislative alternatives, and in particular urged his colleagues to heed “the recommendations of (the) nation’s governors.…” But by being responsible for the defeat of two GOP alternatives to ObamaCare, McCain did just the opposite.

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a fellow Republican, supported the Graham-Cassidy bill – in part because in 2016 his state suffered what The New York Times reported was “the biggest average (health insurance) rate increase in the country. The news was even worse in Phoenix, the nation’s sixth-largest city, where the price of a midlevel plan … increase(d) by 145 percent on average.”

Because ObamaCare was falling apart in Arizona, with all but two providers pulling out, McCain campaigned for re-election to the Senate promising to get rid of it.

Though McCain seemingly acted out of spite, so eager was he to hit back at President Trump, at other times he balked at GOP priorities because they were wrong, as in his opposition to ethanol subsidies and the use of torture. On several occasions he drove the Republican leadership to despair; many voters, though, prized his independence.

Over the past two years, McCain became a thorn in Trump’s side, most recently when he called out the president’s performance at the Helsinki press conference with Vladimir Putin “disgraceful.” The president has returned the favor, often singling out McCain’s vote against repealing ObamaCare at rallies. Recently, when the president signed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act – so named by colleagues to honor the terminally ill senator – Trump refused to mention McCain’s name. That was petty, and like all such pettiness, made President Trump seem small.

With McCain’s passing, the president has a chance to do something grand and magnanimous. It would be another Trump shocker, but could win him many friends among McCain’s enduring supporters. He should give his former rival for the nation’s highest military accolade, the Medal of Honor.",politics
"A group of nine House Republican lawmakers has signed a letter asking Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to provide the names of everyone ""past and present"" who has worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

The lawmakers say they are ""disturbed"" by the initial appointments to the probe of agents and attorneys with an anti-Trump bias. Their letter specifically references agent Peter Strzok, attorney Lisa Page and attorney Kevin Clinesmith.

""We know that these biases were shared among multiple people at the FBI and could be easily uncovered by Mr. Mueller with simple vetting,"" the letter says. ""These individuals should not have been given an opportunity to influence – directly or indirectly – this special counsel investigation.""

REPUBLICANS DEMAND NAMES OF ANTI-TRUMP FBI EMPLOYEES FROM BOMBSHELL IG REPORT

The letter also adds that the lawmakers are concerned that ""there may be more politically biased investigators"" working on Mueller's team.

Republicans have said they believe Clinesmith is the attorney identified in DOJ Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz's report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation as ""Attorney 2."" The Horowitz report, released earlier this month, includes messages from ""Attorney 2"" lamenting Trump's election as well as a missive reading ""viva le resistance.""

Strzok and Page were removed from the Mueller investigation last year after Horowitz's office informed Mueller about their anti-Trump messages. ""Attorney 2,"" believed to be Clinesmith, was the primary FBI attorney assigned to the Mueller investigation but left the probe in February of this year.

""Congress's constitutional oversight gives us the responsibility to know ... whether other members of Mr. Mueller’s team harbor political biases and have conflicts of interest,"" the letter concludes. ""These investigators endanger our ability to uphold justice.""

The letter is signed by Reps. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.; Scott DesJarlais, R-Tenn.; Jeff Duncan, R-S.C.; Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Paul Gosar, R-Ariz.; Andy Harris, R-Md.; Jody Hice, R-Ga., Scott Perry, R-Pa.; and Ralph Norman, R-S.C.",politics
"A “once-in-a-lifetime” trip in May for a woman in Australia quickly turned into a harrowing experience when she suffered a bite while feeding a shark, which then dragged her into the water.

Melissa Brunning, 34, was on a yacht in the remote Kimberley region in the northwest part of the country, located about 1,550 miles north of Perth, when she tried to hand-feed up to four tawny nurse sharks swimming around her boat.

Brunning told the West Australian that she didn't realize she shouldn’t hand feed a shark, until the animal became ""like a Hoover,"" sucking her right index finger into its mouth full of rows of razor-sharp teeth.

“I think the shark was in shock as much as I was ... the only way I can describe it is this immense pressure and it felt like it was shredding it off the bone,” she told the paper. “I came up and I was like, ‘I’ve lost my finger, my finger’s gone.’”

The shark also pulled her into the water of Dugong Bay, which is inhabited by saltwater crocodiles that can grow up to 23 feet long and weigh more than a ton, according to Sky News.

The entire harrowing encounter was captured on video, which shows Brunning screaming as she is dragged into the water before the boat's crew and her friends pull her out.

CANNIBALISTIC GREAT WHITE SHARK EATS RELATIVE AS VIRGINIA RESEARCHERS WATCH

Nurse sharks are ""bottom-dwellers"" that are mostly harmless to humans, according to National Geographic. They are up to 14 feet long and have ""very strong jaws filled with thousands of tiny, serrated teeth,"" the magazine notes.

The sharks will bite and act defensive if they are stepped on, or bothered by divers who assume they’re docile.

Brunning sustained cuts, a fracture, a torn ligament and a bad infection from the bite, but did not lose her finger.

The 34-year-old told the West Australian the incident was “completely my fault,"" and ""just a blonde doing a stupid thing.""

""It’s not the shark’s fault at all, but it could have been a lot worse,” she told the paper, adding, ""I’m not a shark victim .. I have full respect for sharks, I think they’re incredible. I’ve always had the opinion that when you’re in the water, they’re top of the food chain, it’s their domain.""",world
"President Trump blasted the ""Criminal Deep State"" early Wednesday, suggesting things have “turned around” in “SPYGATE,” following revelations of a reported FBI informant snooping on the Trump campaign.

“Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.

Minutes later, the president added: “SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!”

The president’s tweets come after reports that an FBI informant communicated with at least three members of his campaign—Foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, Trump aide Carter Page and campaign adviser Sam Clovis.

Trump then went on to quote former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who discussed the issue of an FBI informant Tuesday during ABC's ""The View.""

“'Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign' No, James Clapper, I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!"" Trump tweeted.

The Justice Department instructed its inspector general to investigate any alleged “impropriety or political motivation” in the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election, following demands from Trump.

“I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes—and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!” the president tweeted Sunday.

Earlier this week, the president met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray in the Oval Office, discussing the expansion of Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation to include “irregularities” with the FBI or DOJ’s “tactics concerning the Trump campaign.”

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also said that during the meeting, the three agreed that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly would “immediately set up a meeting with the FBI, DOJ, and DNI together with congressional leaders to review highly classified and other information they have requested.”

“If they had spies in my campaign…for political purposes, that would be unprecedented,” Trump said Tuesday during a meeting in the Oval Office with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, calling it a “disgrace.”

"August is a time when Washington shuts down for summer recess. The left and the media should have taken the hint. Instead, they stayed and made fools of themselves.

In the space of one week, the press downplayed a Democrat governor saying America “was never that great” and watched as the governor’s brother/CNN anchor defended Antifa. Another CNN commentator bashed America and mocked a conservative while she told of the discrimination her disabled son faced. And former CIA director John Brennan, now an NBC national security analyst, recanted his claim that President Donald Trump committed treason and spent the week whining about losing his security clearance.

Let’s take the Cuomo family, first. (Or just take the Cuomo family, please.) Brothers Andrew and Chris humiliated themselves in separate incidents this past week — showing their mutual contempt for America and the Constitution and highlighting everything that is wrong with journalism all at the same time.

Andrew the-liberal-New-York governor Cuomo, shocked no one when he admitted something conservatives knew all along — that the left hates America. “We are not going to make America great again,” he said during a speech. “It was never that great.”

Of course, the broadcast networks downplayed it, stalling before they covered the remark and giving the disastrous comment barely more than one minute total across ABC, CBS and NBC. Imagine a top Republican saying something like that and getting almost no coverage. Cuomo later backtracked and called his attack on the U.S. “inartful” which is another way of saying: “I got caught, but stand by what I said.”

The younger Cuomo, apparently, didn’t like being upstaged. Chris the-liberal-CNN-anchor Cuomo, shockingly defended Antifa violence saying, “fighting hate is right.” This is the same attitude as the left’s view that it’s OK to punch a Nazi – except Antifa, and possibly some CNN anchors, view everyone they disagree with as Nazis. Cuomo then argued, “all punches are not equal morally.”

Look for Omarosa to do her best impression of her “Apprentice” self and fade as soon as the media find a new or actually credible anti-Trump critic to focus on.

Cuomo’s bizarre defense came when The Washington Post and lefty Vox both criticized Antifa for attacking the press. The Post headlined: “Antifa protesters couldn’t find any fascists at Unite the Right — and harassed the press instead.” And Vox hit back just as hard: “Antifa clashes with police and journalists in Charlottesville and DC.” NBC reporter Cal Perry was assaulted by one Antifa thug who screamed: “Fu** you, snitch ass news b*tch. Fu** you.”

Alas, it wasn’t just the Cuomos showcasing flaws in journalism this week.

CNN commentator Angela Rye actually agreed with the idiotic Cuomo comment (Andrew, not Chris), and attacked conservative Gina Loudon for mentioning her disabled son. Rolling her eyes, Rye exclaimed, “America has never been great, and it’s not great because people like you come on and lie for the president of the United States and then tout, bring out your son as an example. Like, you gotta be completely ashamed of yourself.”

Then NBC’s in-house former CIA director Brennan backed off his own claims that the Trump presser with Russian President Vladimir Putin was “nothing short of treason,” reported The Hill. Brennan, who is trying to defend why he should have kept his security clearance, had to pretend to be rational and now claims, “I didn’t mean that he committed treason. But it was a term that I used, nothing short of treasonous,” he said. Brennan even rationalized his original comment, saying, “sometimes my Irish comes out and in my tweets.”

Of course, Brennan’s new employer NBC seemed especially miffed that he lost his security clearance. “Nightly News” anchor Lester Holt took a dig at the White House, saying, “It looks a lot like payback.”

When press darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez banned the press from a public event, reporters found out that the true face of socialism doesn’t just wear a popular lipstick color.

There was tons more. From hateful “comedian” Michelle Wolf losing her Netflix show to MSNBC anchor/liar Brian Williams asking whether the president “really physically [does] not like dogs.”

That would be enough for an awful media week, but never doubt the ability of New York Times economist Paul Krugman to make a bad situation worse. He ranted in his latest column that Trump was ready to become a dictator. “Make no mistake: if Republicans hold both houses of Congress this November, Trump will go full authoritarian, abusing institutions like the I.R.S., trying to jail opponents and journalists on, er, trumped-up charges, and more — and he’ll do it with full support from his party.”

2. Omarosa’s Unhinged: The media should have known that Omarosa Manigault Newman never wins. In fact, they could have asked Trump about it. He had enough experience firing the “Apprentice” veteran before. Just like her previous TV gigs, Omarosa showed up, created a stir, accused someone of calling her the “N” word and quickly faded from view.

That didn’t stop the press, who ate up Omarosa’s new allegations like she wasn’t someone they had mocked for years. This time, the broadcast networks gave her 93 minutes of coverage — nearly an hour of that on NBC alone.

ABC quoted Omarosa’s bizarre claim about Trump starting a “race war.” And, of course, she called him a “racist.” ABC correspondent Tara Palmeri went off on the president: “According to The Washington Post, which has an advance copy of her book titled ‘Unhinged,’ Manigault Newman claims Trump is a, quote, ‘racist, bigot, and misogynist.’”

MSNBC referred to the Trump-Omarosa dust-up as “an old-fashioned duel that hearkens back to the days of Hamilton and Burr.” One Times reporter compared it to “watching Darth Vader kill the Emperor in the third Star Wars movie.”

Look for Omarosa to do her best impression of her “Apprentice” self and fade as soon as the media find a new or actually credible anti-Trump critic to focus on.

3. Socialists Don’t Like The Press?: The media have a default setting that everyone on the right hates the press. In the minds of reporters, that means the left must love the press. Too bad it seldom works out that way.

We’ve had candidate Barack Obama throw reporters off the campaign plane for the crime of having their outlets support his opponent. One-time press icon Helen Thomas compared President Obama to President Richard Nixon for how he dealt with the press. Hillary Clinton roped off the press like cattle during her campaign. And now press darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez banned the press from a public event.

How quickly garden variety socialists go from rock stars to press opponents. Only two weeks ago, The Hollywood Reporter called Ocasio-Cortez a “rock-star Democratic congressional candidate.” When The Daily Wire’s Ben Shapiro challenged her to a debate, many in the media stood by their second-favorite socialist (no one outshines Sen. Bernie Sanders.) Elle criticized “Ben Shapiro's Bad-Faith Debate Offer” and Broadly led its story with “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez doesn't suffer fools.”

Now, they all find that the true face of socialism doesn’t just wear a popular lipstick color.

The result was Ocasio-Cortez getting skewered by journalists across the political spectrum. Washington Post White House reporter Seung Min Kim ripped into the likely future congresswoman. “You cannot ban members of the press from events that are otherwise open to the public. That is not how it works. Period.” Ocasio-Cortez has called it a “non-story.” That’s less of a claim and more of a request.

She’ll likely get her wish as the press remembers they support all of her policies.",politics
"Hotly contested gubernatorial primary races across the country could make history on Tuesday, as Republicans hope to continue to erode Democratic control of New England governorships and progressives look to nominate the nation's first-ever transgender candidate to a state's highest office.

In deep-blue Connecticut, which went for Hillary Clinton by double-digits in the 2016 presidential campaign, Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim and wealthy businessman Ned Lamont are competing for the Democratic nomination to succeed deeply unpopular Gov. Dan Malloy.

Malloy, who decided not to seek a third term, was shown by some polls to be the least popular governor in the nation, with critics citing the state's high taxes and major budget woes. That's left an opening for Republicans, who are looking to continue to encroach on governorships in the traditionally liberal New England.

The GOP currently holds the governorships of four out of six states in the region, including Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.

New England, long a liberal stronghold, has been home to something of a Republican insurgence in recent years, with GOP candidates attributing their success to a healthy mixture of fiscal conservatism, socially moderate views and a willingness to collaborate with political rivals.

TUESDAY'S BIG PRIMARY: WILL THE #METOO MOVEMENT HAVE A ROLE?

Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, former First Selectman Tim Herbst, businessman Steve Obsitnik, former investment banker Bob Stefanowski and former hedge fund manager David Stemerman are the candidates for the GOP nomination in Connecticut's governor race, and they've also cited an additional factor: widespread unhappiness with state Democratic leadership.

""There is definitely frustration, and I think that’s why you sort of see that red tide, a mini red tide if you will, out in this part of the state in terms of seats flipping from blue to red,” Boughton, the GOP’s endorsed candidate, told The Associated Press.

However, the Republican candidates have disagreed on what to do with the state's income tax. Stefanowski and Boughton have said they want to eliminate it entirely, while Stemerman and Obsitnik have balked at the idea.

Meanwhile, in Vermont, Republican Gov. Phil Scott is running for re-election – and is favored to win it. No sitting governor has been defeated in Vermont since 1962, but Democrats have two candidates running who could make history, and some Republicans remain upset about Scott's decision to sign gun-control legislation into law earlier this year.

WATCH: PROTESTERS HECKLE 'TRAITOR' VERMONT GOVERNOR FOR SIGNING ANTI-GUN LAW

Christine Hallquist is vying to be the first openly transgender woman to serve as a U.S. governor. A former CEO of the Vermont Electric Cooperative, Hallquist is focused on tackling climate change and implementing universal health care in the Green Mountain State.

""Nationally, I want to be known as the first trans candidate."" - Christine Hallquist

She's appealed to Vermonters with a progressive message including a livable wage, Medicare for all, free public college education and high-speed broadband access — even to those who live on remote back roads.

""That's how I want to be known in Vermont,"" Hallquist, 62, told The Associated Press in an interview at her Burlington offices. ""Nationally, I want to be known as the first trans candidate.""

Another Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Vermont is hoping to make history on Monday, as well: a 14-year-old boy who took advantage of the state constitution's lack of an age requirement to hold office.

The boy, Ethan Sonneborn, has hit the ground running, attending debates and insisting he could lead the state.

""I think Vermonters should take me seriously because I have practical progressive ideas, and I happen to be 14, not the other way around,"" Sonneborn said in a recent televised gubernatorial forum. ""I think that my message and my platform transcend age.""

In April, Scott signed what for Vermont was historic — if mild by national standards — restrictions on gun ownership, angering his Republican base. His once sky-high popularity has waned, potentially leaving an opening for a well-funded Democratic challenger. Scott faces a primary challenge from Springfield businessman Keith Stern, who describes himself as a conservative running on financial issues.

Meanwhile, Wisconsin and Minnesota are home to tight races with national significance.

In Wisconsin, eight Democrats are running in the primary to take on incumbent Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican and former presidential candidate who faces only one challenger within his own party. Trump barely eked out a win over Clinton in the 2016 presidential election in Wisconsin, earning 47.8 percent of the vote compared to her 47.0 percent.

Walker has warned of a possible ""blue wave"" in November, saying ""the wind's not at our back.""

And in Minnesota, Tim Pawlenty is hoping to stage a political comeback and become Minnesota’s governor again, in a race that Fox News considers a tossup.

Pawlenty is one of three candidates vying for the GOP nomination for governor to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton. His main opponent is Jeff Johnson, who was the party’s 2014 gubernatorial nominee. On the Democrats’ side are: state Rep. Erin Murphy, Minnesota Attorney Gen. Lori Swanson and U.S. Rep. Tim Walz.

Pawlenty said he retired from politics after he suspended his 2012 presidential campaign. He was first elected as Minnesota’s governor in 2002 and was re-elected four years later. After he left the statehouse, he spent several years working for the Financial Services Roundtable in Washington, D.C

Also in Minnesota, Rep. Keith Ellison’s campaign for state attorney general was thrown for a loop after an ex-girlfriend publicly alleged he emotionally and physically abused her during the course of their relationship.

Ellison was considered the heavy favorite leading up to the primary, given his fundraising advantage and leadership in the Democratic National Committee as its deputy chairman. He also got support from 2016 presidential contender and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

"Iranian-backed Houthis fighting for control of Yemen are swelling their rebel army with children as young as 6, giving them food, a few dollars a day and the grim warning that “there is no going home to Mommy and Daddy,” according to human rights advocates.

“The Houthis are wooing the children with food, because everyone is starving."" - Mohammad, physician from Yemen

As the gulf nation continues its descent into full-blown civil war, with Iran backing the rebels and a Saudi-led coalition supporting President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, the Houthis are increasingly desperate to bolster their army. Orphans, teens recruited from bazaars and even young children forced into conscription now form as much as 40 percent of the rebel army’s ranks, according to experts.

“These are young, enthusiastic—because they are too young to know what war is—young men from poor families who are happy to receive a uniform and an AK47 and to be formally treated like men,” Hisham al-Omeisy, a political activist based in Sanaa said in an interview with Fox News.

In many cases, poor families are all too happy to send their children off to fight, al-Omeisy said.

Rough estimates put the total number of Houthi fighters between 20,000 and 30,000, of which 30 to 40 percent are under 18 and almost a quarter under 16, al-Omeisy said, although given the difficulty in obtaining access and the dangerous security situation, it is nearly impossible for activists and rights groups to be exact on the number of children involved.

A United Nations report found the Houthis took in child soldiers as young as 6. The children can earn up to $100 a month, lucrative pay in a land where the poor subsist on just $2 a day. They also get a warm meal, which according to activists is enough of a draw for many young boys to leave school and joined armed groups.

In return, they are positioned at checkpoints and embedded in areas newly seized by Houthi forces.

“The Houthis are wooing the children with food, because everyone is starving,” said Mohammad, an internal medicine physician from Taiz who asked to remain anonymous.

As Mohammad spoke, the sound of Houthi tanks and mortar could be heard over the phone. The attack came even as a fragile international cease fire was supposedly in place.

“There is an ‘aerial ceasefire,’ but that doesn’t mean Houthis can’t make their moves with tanks,” he said.

Mohammad said he fears for the rebels’ youngest soldiers, who are cruelly lured or forced into a dead-end duty.

“They are taught to either reach victory or die,” he said. “There is no going home to Mommy and Daddy.”

The official minimum age for joining the army is 18, but bribing families with food and pay allows both the government and the Houthis to recruit much younger boys. The use of children has more to do with population demographics than strategy, according to al-Omeisy, who noted almost half of Yemen’s population is under age 14.

Following 10 years of several state wars, sectarian fighting and rampant terrorism, the Houthis are challenged to find adult fighters.

Before the Houthis were recruiting children, other groups including Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula, its affiliate Ansar al Sharia and even the Yemeni army were employing them.

In 2011, child soldiers were recruited by the Yemeni Armed Forces to confront the Houthis in the north during Yemen’s ‘Arab Spring’ uprising against former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was forced from office after 33 years under threat of prosecution and replaced by Hadi.

The Houthis, a Shia Muslim group loyal to Saleh, drove Hadi from his palace and seized control of Sanaa in January. Hadi is now in Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to restore his administration and, as Sunnis, does not want Iran to expand influence in the region.

Last May, Yemen’s government signed a plan put forth by the U.N to stop the recruitment of children by the country’s army. This would put Yemen on international law standards, which prohibit the use of child soldiers, according to Human Rights Watch.

"The Supreme Court ruled Monday in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, in one of the most closely watched cases of the term.

In a 7-2 decision, the justices set aside a Colorado court ruling against the baker -- while stopping short of deciding the broader issue of whether a business can refuse to serve gay and lesbian people. The opinion was penned by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is often the swing justice in tight cases.

The narrow ruling here focused on what the court described as anti-religious bias on the Colorado Civil Rights Commission when it ruled against baker Jack Phillips.

""The Commission’s hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment’s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion,"" Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion.

READ THE DECISION

Attorney Michael Farris, president of the Alliance Defending Freedom which represented the baker, told Fox News that Phillips is “ecstatic” at the decision.

“Justice Kennedy has held that tolerance is a two-way street, and Jack Phillips was not tolerated by the Civil Rights Commission of Colorado,” he said.

The court said the broader issue, though, ""must await further elaboration.""

“The reason and motive for the baker’s refusal were based on his sincere religious beliefs and convictions. The Court’s precedents make clear that the baker, in his capacity as the owner of a business serving the public, might have his right to the free exercise of religion limited by generally applicable laws,"" Kennedy wrote. ""Still, the delicate question of when the free exercise of his religion must yield to an otherwise valid exercise of state power needed to be determined in an adjudication in which religious hostility on the part of the State itself would not be a factor in the balance the State sought to reach.""

At issue was a July 2012 encounter. At the time, Charlie Craig and David Mullins of Denver visited Masterpiece Cakeshop to buy a custom-made wedding cake. Phillips refused his services when told it was for a same-sex couple. The state civil rights commission sanctioned Phillips after a formal complaint from the gay couple.

Mullins has described their case as symbolizing “the rights of gay people to receive equal service in business … about basic access to public life.""

But the Trump administration backed Phillips, who was represented in court by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian nonprofit. He had lost at every step in the legal appeals process, bringing the case down to the Supreme Court's decision Monday.

""Today’s decision means our fight against discrimination and unfair treatment will continue. We have always believed that in America, you should not be turned away from a business open to the public because of who you are. We brought this case because no one should have to face the shame, embarrassment, and humiliation of being told 'we don’t serve your kind here' that we faced, and we will continue fighting until no one does,"" Craig and Mullins responded Monday.

Phillips has said he lost business and had to let employees go because of the controversy.

And he has maintained that it’s his choice: ""It's not about turning away these customers, it's about doing a cake for an event -- a religious sacred event -- that conflicts with my conscience,"" he said last year.

The court in December specifically examined whether applying Colorado's public accommodations law to compel the local baker to create commercial ""expression"" violated his constitutionally protected Christian beliefs about marriage.

By wading again into the culture wars, the justices had to confront recent decisions on both gay rights and religious liberty: a 2015 landmark opinion legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide and a separate 2014 decision affirming the right of some companies to act on their owner's faith by refusing to provide contraception to its workers.

The Trump administration agreed with Phillips' legal claims to a large extent. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in October issued broad guidance to executive branch agencies, reiterating the government should respect religious freedom, which in the Justice Department's eyes extends to people, businesses and organizations.

But civil rights groups were concerned the conservative majority on the court may be ready to peel back protections for groups with a history of enduring discrimination – and predicted that giving businesses the right to refuse service to certain customers would undermine non-discrimination laws and hurt minorities.

When the justices heard arguments in December, Kennedy was plainly bothered by certain comments by a commission member. The commissioner seemed ""neither tolerant nor respectful of Mr. Phillips' religious beliefs,"" Kennedy said in December.

Liberal justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan joined the conservative justices in the outcome. Kagan wrote separately to emphasize the limited ruling.

But Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.

""I see no reason why the comments of one or two Commissioners should be taken to overcome Phillips’ refusal to sell a wedding cake to Craig and Mullins,"" Ginsburg wrote.

Sarah Warbelow, legal director with the Human Rights Campaign, also stressed that the decision “is so narrow as to apply only to this particular baker.”

"The killing of Iowa college student Mollie Tibbetts, allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant, has placed a spotlight on the state's Democratic party, which this summer denounced federal immigration laws and called for local officials not to enforce them.

But Iowa Democratic party officials on Wednesday would not say whether they stood by their immigration platform, and instead characterized the matter as a ""partisan fight.""

""The Iowa Democratic Party is going to honor the wishes of the Tibbetts family to let them grieve in private and will not turn this senseless tragedy into a partisan fight,"" Iowa Democratic Party chairman Troy Price told Fox News.

The national uproar over Tibbetts' slaying also threatens to upend two key House races underway in the state, which are considered potentially pivotal to Democrats' chances of retaking the House in November's midterm elections.

The 2018 Iowa Democratic Party platform, in a section entitled ""Statement of Issues,"" reads: ""We oppose: detaining undocumented minors, immigrant detention/deportation quotas, locally enforcing federal immigration laws, mass raids/related enforcement practices, religious exclusion, 'papers please,' unnecessary travel-bans, abrogating birthright-citizenship, separating minor children from their parents when they are trying to enter the country, internment and concentration camps.""

The platform was adopted at a state convention in June. It goes on in a ""Statement of Principles"" to ""affirm the Democratic Party’s contributions to our nation’s heritage, accomplishments, and diversity.""

Asked directly whether Iowa officials still did not want local police to enforce federal immigration law, Price did not respond. Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne, the two candidates Democrats have nominated to take on vulnerable Republican congressmen in the state, did not immediately respond to Fox News' inquiries as to their positions on the party platform.

FARM THAT HIRED SUSPECT TIBBETTS KILLING DIDN'T USE E-VERIFY, OFFICIAL SAYS

On Wednesday, an Iowa judge ordered Cristhian Rivera, the 24-year-old illegal immigrant accused of killing Tibbetts, held on $5 million cash-only bond. Rivera was mostly stoic and looked straight ahead in the courtroom. He wore headphones and used an interpreter when the judge spoke, only answering ""Yes"" when asked if he understood the proceeding.

A body believed to be Tibbetts was discovered Tuesday hidden in a corn field beneath several corn stalks after Rivera led authorities to the location.

Tibbetts' killing has fueled Republican calls to strengthen border security, while raising questions as to how Rivera was able to enter and remain in the country.

Rivera worked at a dairy farm, Yarrabee Farms, for the past four years -- less than three miles from where the 20-year-old University of Iowa student was staying the night she vanished in July. The company said he was in good standing as a worker and was shocked to learn of his alleged involvement in Tibbetts' disappearance and murder.

The suspect told law enforcement he approached Tibbetts while she was running, according to authorities. He claimed to have blacked out and realized later that he had put Tibbetts in his trunk. Investigators said they believed Rivera had been in the area for four to seven years.

WHAT MURDER SUSPECT CRISTHIAN RIVERA TOLD COPS ABOUT TIBBETTS' SLAYING

On Wednesday night, President Trump cited Tibbetts' case to call for changes to the country's immigration laws.

""Molly Tibbetts, an incredible young woman, is now permanently separated from her family. A person came in from Mexico Illegally and killed her. We need the wall, we need our immigration laws changed. We need our border laws changed. We need Republicans to do it because the Democrats aren’t going to do it. This is one instance of many,"" the president said in a video posted to Twitter.

Democrats are aggressively trying to flip the House seats of two Republicans in Iowa in November, Reps. David Young in the 3rd Congressional District and Rod Blum in the 1st Congressional District.

Both races are toss-ups, and are considered key contests as Democrats try to retake the House in the midterms. That would require Democrats winning a total of 24 currently GOP-held seats.

Immigration had played a significant role in two campaigns even before Tibbetts' disappearance.

Democrats have nominated Finkenauer and Axne to take on Blum and Young, respectively. Both Finkenauer and Axne are seeking to the first women to represent Iowa in the House.

Axne has vowed to a provide a ""full path to citizenship for Dreamers and undocumented immigrants who don't have a criminal background,"" referring to illegal immigrants brought to the country as children. The progressive Finkenauer also has come out in support of immigration reform.

Neither Axne nor Finkenauer responded to Fox News' requests for comments on the Tibbetts case.

On the Republican side, Young had taken a moderate approach to the issue, saying he wanted border security but also a path to citizenship for Dreamers, the Des Moines Register reported. Blum, for his part, has called for an end to family separations at the border in the wake of the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy on arresting all illegal border crossers, but stressed that media coverage of the issue has been unfair.

PHILADELPHIA TERMINATES ICE CONTRACT AFTER ACTIVISTS STORM CITY HALL

The Tibbetts case also could have national political ramifications. The once-fringe call to abolish ICE in recent months has been picked up by top 2020 Democratic prospects, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.

There are signs not all Democrats are ready to take the idea mainstream, though. In July, House Republicans passed a nonbinding resolution expressing support for ICE, effectively daring Democrats to oppose the measure on record. Only 35 Democrats voted against the bill, with 133 voting present.

"Anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok insisted on preserving his security clearance and powers he held as a deputy assistant director at the agency before joining Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team, newly released emails show.

The emails, acquired by the conservative watchdog Judicial Watch, reveal that Strzok’s supervisor agreed to make him a “floating” deputy who would be able to approve national security letters and declassify documents – all while working on the Mueller team investigating the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with the Russian government.

“Broadly, I need to be able to act at least in the capacity of my old CD [counterintelligence division] DAD [deputy assistant director] job – approve NSLs [national security letters], conduct [redacted] declassify information, [redacted] agent travel, requisitions, etc. Of those, the most problematic and one of the most essential is declassification authority,” Strzok wrote in an email to Bill Priestap, FBI counterintelligence chief, dated July 13, 2017.

""Of those, the most problematic and one of the most essential is declassification authority."" - Peter Strzok

Priestap wrote back a few days later, saying his request was approved: “In answer to your initial question, while assigned to the special counsel’s office, you will retain your CD DAD authorities to include declassification authority.”

“Assuming the 7th floor approves, you will remain on CD’s books as a fourth (floating) DAD. When you move on from your DAD position, your DAD slot will revert back to HRD [human resources department],” he added.

Strzok's insistence on keeping the declassification authority raises concerns whether such authority gave the Mueller investigation special capabilities to target President Trump.

“It sure did,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told Fox News. “Strzok wouldn't have asked for it if he didn't think it'd be useful in his new job.”

“He wanted the authority to issue national security letters, which essentially are secret requests for information that fall short of needing court approval,” Fitton continued. “He also wanted – and he said this was ‘essential,’ which is very unusual – he wanted the ability to declassify information. He wanted to keep that ability.”

""Strzok wouldn't have asked for it if he didn't think it'd be useful in his new job."" - Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton

The FBI agent has been under fire ever since he was removed in the summer of 2017 after he exchanged tens of thousands of texts with then-colleague Lisa Page, with whom he had an extramarital affair, and expressed anti-Trump comments, raising questions of bias.

“[Trump's] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!” Page texted to Strzok in August 2016, months before Trump won the presidential election. “No. No he won't. We'll stop it,” Strzok responded.

FIREWORKS AT STRZOK HEARING AS GOP REPS FUME AT ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT, THREATEN CONTEMPT

Last month, the FBI agent testified before Congress, denying his personal views affected his job as an investigator.

""Like many people, I had and expressed personal political opinions during an extraordinary presidential election. Many contained expressions of concern for the security of our country,"" Strzok said in his opening statement, noting that those opinions were expressed ""out of deep patriotism.""

He also later denied that the FBI would interfere in the election to stop one particular candidate. “The suggestion that I, in some dark chamber in the FBI, would somehow cast aside these procedures ... and somehow be able to do this is astounding to me,” he said.",politics

The hearing descended into chaos within seconds as Democrats lined up to object to what they call a failure in the production of documents related to Kavanaugh’s service in the Bush White House.

The repeated interruptions coincided with regular protests by left-wing group Code Pink and other protesters, who cheered the objections by Democrats and were dragged out of the hearing in the dozens.

“Mr. Chairman if we cannot be recognized, I move to adjourn, Mr. Chairman I move to adjourn. Mr. Chairman I move to adjourn,” Blumenthal said to wild applause from protesters.

Grassley said at the outset that he wanted to let those speak who had something to say. But as the objections dragged on, he expressed frustration at the repeated requests for time by Democrats.

“Can I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle how long you want to go on with this because I’m not going to entertain any of the motions you’re making, we’re not in executive session and I think we ought to level with the American people -- do you want this to go on all day?” he asked.

"A fiery testament published Sunday calls for Pope Francis to step down, alleging that the top Holy see authority was made aware soon after becoming pope in 2013 that the former archbishop of Washington, ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, had engaged in unlawful sexual indiscretions but chose not to act.

“My conscience requires me also to reveal facts that I have experienced personally, concerning Pope Francis, that have a dramatic significance,” Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, 77, wrote in the eleven-page letter, published by the National Catholic Register and LifeSiteNews. “Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick’s abuses and resign along with all of them.”

Viganò, who served as Vatican ambassador to the U.S. from 2011 to 2016, goes on to assert that two former ambassadors wrote to the Vatican in 2000 and 2006 to document that McCarrick had engaged sexually with seminarians and priests. As a Vatican secretariat of state at the time, Viganò advocated that the then-cardinal be penalized.

He also states that around 2009 or 2010, Pope Benedict XVI confidentially imposed sanctions on McCarrick – essentially prohibiting him from public ministry and to carry out a life of prayer and penance – but that Francis then opted to re-instate him, “cover” for him and advance him to the role of a “trusted counselor.”

“The corruption has reached the very top of the Church’s hierarchy,” Viganò wrote, adding that he notified Francis of the allegations against McCarrick after he was elected pope five years ago and alerted him to the instituted sanctions – but his report supposedly fell on deaf ears. “I implore everyone, especially bishops, to speak up in order to defeat this conspiracy of silence that is so widespread, and to report the cases of abuse they know about to the media and civil authorities.”

ARCHAEOLOGISTS FEAR BIBLICAL ARTIFACTS, MONUMENTS WON'T SURVIVE YEMEN WAR

Following an internal investigation, the church announced in June that it has found “credible evidence” that the then-Cardinal McCarrick had sexually abused a teenager 47 years earlier. In July, after more charges surfaced – including a proclamation from Catholic Church officials in New Jersey that secret settlements had been previously made to at least two McCarrick accusers.

The 88-year-old seceded from the College of Cardinals, the first person to have done so in decades, while the Vatican said that he would be trialed under church law.

Nonetheless, McCarrick has staunchly maintained his innocence and has said he was “shocked” when he learned of the claim involving a child almost five decades earlier.

Viganò’s explosive communique comes amid the pope’s historic visit to Ireland, the first for a pontiff since 1979, which has largely been clouded by the unfolding sex abuse crisis spanning multiple countries from the U.S. to Australia to Chile.

STUNNING FINDINGS ON REPORT OF CATHOLIC CHURCH ABUSE: PA. PRIESTS MOLESTED MORE THAN 1,000 CHILDREN

On Saturday, Pope Francis denounced the abuse in a speech to Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin Castle, and met quietly with Irish abuse victims. On Sunday morning, he again pleaded for clemency over the long-running abuse in Irish church institutions during a visit to the Marian shrine at Knock.

“None of us can fail to be moved by the stories of young people who suffered abuse, were robbed of their innocence and left scarred,” Francis told the tens of thousands of gatherers at the shrine. “This open wound challenges us to be firm and decisive in the pursuit of truth and justice. I beg forgiveness for these sins and for the scandal and betrayal felt by so many others in God’s family.”

However, activists and abuse victims in Ireland have conveyed disappointment that Pope Francis has not announced definitive measures or conceded Vatican responsibility for alleged cover-ups.

"President Trump on Saturday took aim again at former CIA Director John Brennan, whose security clearance he yanked days ago, calling him a “political hack” who “cannot be trusted” with national secrets.

“Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director? He will go down as easily the WORST in history & since getting out, he has become nothing less than a loudmouth, partisan, political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!” he tweeted.

Brennan, who has been a frequent, very vocal critic of Trump, had his security clearance revoked on Wednesday, with the White House saying he had been “leveraging” his clearance to make “wild outbursts” against the administration.

For his part, Brennan declared the move to take away his clearance “part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to suppress freedom of speech & punish critics.”

12 EX-INTEL OFFICIALS SLAM TRUMP FOR 'ILL-CONSIDERED AND UNPRECEDENTED' ACTION AGAINST BRENNAN

The move sparked a backlash in the intelligence community, with 12 former officials issuing a statement criticizing what they called an “ill-considered and unprecedented” decision by Trump.

“The president’s action regarding John Brennan and the threats of similar action against other former officials has nothing to do with who should and should not hold security clearances — and everything to do with an attempt to stifle free speech,” the statement said.

Among the signers were six former CIA directors -- including retired Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, who was a potential candidate for secretary of state in the early days of the Trump administration.

But Kris “Tanto” Paronto, who was part of the CIA team that fought back during the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya, said Brennan got what he deserved.

SPECIAL OPS SHOOT DOWN BRENNAN AND HIS DEFENDERS: 'YOU PUT YOUR POLITICS BEFORE US

“He is lucky the security clearance is all he is getting away with,” Paronto told Fox News in an interview on Friday. He had previously accused Brennan of putting his politics before those in the field.

“We come back from being on the ground to be treated as a second-class citizen. You come back and you’re called a liar,” Paronto said. “Brennan came in and there was no talk of ‘Hey, good job guys,’ not that you look for it, but instead, it was ‘Don’t say anything guys, we don’t want the truth to get out.’”

"As many as 40 state-level Democratic parties may have been involved in a scheme to funnel as much as $84 million to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, a campaign finance lawyer contends.

Dan Backer, an attorney based in Virginia, has filed a lawsuit alleging that a plan was in place to circumvent campaign contribution limits set by the federal government, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

“You had individuals giving $300,000,” Backer told the newspaper Friday. “They’re not doing it because they care about Nevada’s or Arkansas’ state party. They’re doing it to curry favor with and buy influence with Hillary Clinton.”

“You had individuals giving $300,000. They’re not doing it because they care about Nevada’s or Arkansas’ state party. They’re doing it to curry favor with and buy influence with Hillary Clinton.” - Dan Backer, campaign finance attorney

Nevada’s Democratic Party may become the latest pulled into a federal lawsuit that Backer has filed, the paper reported. Backer represents the Committee to Defend the President, a pro-Donald Trump political action committee that initially lodged a complaint in December with the Federal Election Commission, the report says.

Backer told the paper he filed his lawsuit because the FEC failed to meet a deadline for taking action.

He said the Hillary Victory Fund reported transferring more than $1.7 million to the Nevada Democratic Party between December 2015 and November 2016. But the party reported receiving only $146,200, which it transferred to the DNC.

The remaining $1.6 million was sent by the Hillary Victory Fund to the Nevada party and received by the DNC and never appeared on the Nevada party’s reports, Backer contends.

But Nevada's Democratic Party disputed Backer's claims.

“This is nothing more than a bogus political stunt feebly designed to distract from vulnerable Republicans’ disastrous agenda,” Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for the Nevada Democratic Party, told the Review Journal.

“This is nothing more than a bogus political stunt feebly designed to distract from vulnerable Republicans’ disastrous agenda.” - Helen Kalla, spokeswoman, Nevada Democratic Party

In Idaho, Democrats allegedly contributed $1.6 million to the plan in a series of 13 transactions, the Idaho Statesman reported.

But local party officials might have been unaware of how the money was being handled, the paper reported.

It is ""reasonably possible the Idaho State Democratic Party had no prior knowledge of, or control over, these transfers because they were handled entirely by HVF, the DNC, HFA, [Hillary Victory Fund, Democratic National Committee, Hillary for America] and/or their treasurers,"" states the 101-page complaint that Backer’s group filed in December, the Statesman reported.

The Idaho Democratic Party did not respond to the newspaper’s request for a comment.

In Delaware, the state Democratic Party received $2.4 million from the Hillary Victory Fund over 11 transactions, then transferred roughly the same amount to the DNC, WXDE-FM radio reported.

The handling of cash in Delaware “doesn’t pass the sniff test,” Backer told the station.

But Jesse Chadderdon, executive director of the Delaware Democratic Party, called Backer’s lawsuit “yet another blatant example of hypocrisy from Donald Trump and his cronies.”

“Let’s be clear, this is nothing more than a Beltway political stunt,” Chadderdon told the station, “led by the pro-Trump PAC 'The Committee to Defend the President,' one that's simply designed to distract Delaware voters.”",politics
"Former President Barack Obama on Wednesday endorsed dozens of Democrats in races across the country, flexing his political muscle in the midterms and vowing to hit the stump for some of them before November.

Notably, the former president did not endorse liberal darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her New York House race. The 'democratic socialist' has teamed up on the campaign trail with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., but her high profile after defeating House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley in the primary has raised concerns in some corners of the party.

In New York, Obama endorsed two candidates—House hopeful Antonio Delgado and Anna Kaplan for a state Senate seat.

Among his most prominent endorsements were for Gavin Newsom for governor of California, Stacey Abrams for governor of Georgia and Jacky Rosen, the Democrat running against incumbent Republican Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada.

“I am proud to endorse such a wide and impressive array of Democratic candidates—leaders as diverse, patriotic, and big-hearted as the America they’re running to represent,” Obama said in a statement on Wednesday. “I’m confident that, together, they’ll strengthen this country we love by restoring opportunity that’s broadly shared, repairing our alliances and standing in the world, and upholding our fundamental commitment to justice, fairness, responsibility and the rule of law.”

His list of 81 endorsements includes more than a half-dozen former administration and campaign officials.

Obama also weighed in on home state races in Illinois, offering endorsements for gubernatorial candidate J.B. Pritzker (brother of his former Commerce secretary Penny Pritzker) and several House candidates, as well as candidate for Illinois attorney general Kwame Raoul.

Obama earlier this year endorsed Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who is in a tight Democrat-vs.-Democrat race against Kevin de Leon in November.

After the Wednesday release, Obama tweeted the endorsements, as his office said another round would be coming before November.

Republicans, though, suggested the endorsements could do more harm than good.

""No one's more to blame for how weak today's Democratic Party is than President Obama,"" Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens told Fox News. ""He cost them over 1,000 legislative seats, decimated their state parties and voters rejected his policies at the ballot box less than two years ago.""

According to Obama’s office, the former president’s endorsements were made in an effort to “help current and aspiring Democratic leaders establish themselves, build their profiles, and lead their communities.”

His office noted that some of the endorsements were given to “several promising Obama Administration and campaign alumni who heeded the President’s call in his farewell speech to 'grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself.'”",politics
"Days of unprecedented protests aimed at Iran's sluggish economy along with ""biting"" sanctions imposed by President Trump are ramping up pressure Tuesday on the Islamic Republic's ruling class and causing many analysts to wonder if regime change could be on the horizon.

Videos circulating on social media purportedly taken from inside Iran show thousands of protesters marching through the streets. In one video, crowds leaving a soccer match are heard yelling ""death to the dictator! Death to Khamenei! Death to Rouhani!"" and ""Islamic regime must get lost!” according to a translation tweeted by a Middle East analyst.

Another video said to be taken in Tehran shows idle buses lined up as far as the eye can see, with the same analyst reporting Iran’s government has refused to pay back its debts to a contractor that gives the drivers fuel, leaving them – and the thousands of Iranians they would have been transporting – stranded.

""Look at our situation. We've been waiting for 24 hours,” a bus driver is reported to have said in another clip. “How dare the regime sends money to Hezbollah and Palestine when the country is in trouble. Our revolution's aim wasn't to support dirty [Hezbollah leader] Hassan Nasrallah and we can be oppressed here. Enough.""

A senior Trump administration official told Fox News the restored sanctions against Iran that went into effect at midnight are designed to constrict the revenue Iran uses to fund “terrorists, dictators, proxy militias, and the regime’s own cronies.”

Trump signed the executive order Monday to restore some of the sanctions that were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal during the Obama administration. The executive order targeted transactions involving U.S. dollars, as well as the country’s automotive sector, the purchase of commercial planes and metals, including gold.

In November, the administration says it will restore sanctions on Iran’s oil and gas and banking sector.

An administration official said the U.S. will aggressively enforce these sanctions, potentially subjecting even allied businesses to penalties.

“Individuals or entities that fail to wind down activities with Iran risk severe consequences,” said Trump in a statement.

Trump on Tuesday added he is “asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!”

“The Iran sanctions have officially been cast. These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level,” he tweeted. “Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States.”

The uncertainty caused by the re-imposition of the sanctions have proved devastating for the Iranian economy, which was already weakened by decades of previous sanctions and mismanagement and theft by high-ranking officials. Iran's rial now trades over double its government-set rate to the U.S. dollar, the Associated Press reported, and has lost nearly 80 percent of its value compared to last year at this time, according to the New York Times.

""We are facing an economic war and the U.S. government is restoring sanctions and also trying to increase them,"" the new governor of the Central Bank of Iran, Abdolnasser Hemmati, told the Associated Press on Sunday. ""But our government is powerful...and is capable of opening up the foreign currency market on the same day.""

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Monday, meanwhile, said in a television interview he has “no preconditions” for talks with America and his country can rely on China and Russia to help its oil and banking sectors as the U.S. ramps up sanctions in the coming months.

And Britain, France and Germany have been working with Iran, China and Russia to salvage the Iran deal, which the Trump administration pulled the U.S. out of.

“We are determined to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran…the preservation and maintenance of effective financial channels with Iran, and the continuation of Iran’s export of oil and gas,” a joint statement from Great Britain, France, Germany and the European Union said.

But regardless of European and Asian support, the protests are continuing in Iran – and show no signs of stopping.

In Mashad, the country’s second-largest city, demonstrations were captured on video Monday after a cleric told the public to take to the streets because the government isn't fulfilling its promises, according to The Wall Street Journal. Another video reportedly showed crowds chanting insults about security forces in the city of Kazerun.

The protests have also turned deadly, as one demonstrator was reported to have been killed in Karaj on Friday. Activists there told Al Arabiya that a young man was gunned down by security forces, while Iran’s Fars news agency claimed he was killed by unknown attackers.

"First time offenders who come into the U.S. illegally are generally charged with a misdemeanor – but a new bill aims to change that.

Legislation introduced by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., Tuesday would make illegal entry into the U.S. a felony offense, something she said would act as a “disincentive” to people who are thinking of crossing the border.

“The United States government should never prioritize illegal immigrants over American citizens,” Black said in a statement. “By no longer creating incentives to come to our country unlawfully, we also discourage families from sending their children on an often dangerous journey to reach our southern border.”

WHAT TRUMP'S 'ZERO-TOLERANCE' IMMIGRATION POLICY MEANS FOR CHILDREN AT THE BORDER

A felony record would hinder an individual attempting to come into the U.S. legally as it would prevent that person from obtaining a green card, Black told Fox News.

""We are a compassionate nation and we are a country filled with compassionate people. I've been abroad and I've seen the hardships that people go through, but we've got to have some kind of control and order,"" she said.

Dubbed the “Zero Tolerance for Illegal Entry Act,” Black’s bill would also mandate employers use the E-Verify system to ensure employees are in the country legally and allowed to work in the U.S. Additionally, it redirects funding from so-called sanctuary cities to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

JUDGE TOSSES OUT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S LAWSUIT AGAINST CALIFORNIA'S SANCTUARY STATE LAW

“It’s so simple,” Black said of her bill. “It just takes some of the [issues] we’ve talked about for years and puts it all in one bill.”

Black, who has served in Congress since 2011, is also running for governor in Tennessee.

The congresswoman's new border security push comes on the heels of the Justice Department's enforcement of its own ""zero-tolerance"" policy, which was first introduced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April.

"Dutch prosecutors on Monday announced that the 19-year-old Afghan citizen accused of stabbing two American tourists may have done so because he believes Islam is insulted in the Netherlands.

The announcement came after officials said there was a “terrorist motive” behind the attack.

The suspect, identified only as Jawed S., allegedly stabbed the two Americans at Amsterdam’s Central Station just after noon on Friday. His reasoning for targeting the victims was not based on their nationality, prosecutors said. Rather, the suspect's grievance was with the European country where the assault took place, they said in a written statement.

""It is apparent from his statements that he believes that in the Netherlands, the Prophet Muhammad, the Quran, Islam and Allah are repeatedly insulted,"" prosecutors said, noting that the Afghan man specifically mentioned Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders, who is known for his fierce anti-Islam rhetoric.

""From the suspect's statements so far, it is clear the man had a terrorist motive ... and that he traveled to the Netherlands for that reason,"" the prosecutors said.

The Americans suffered serious but non life-threatening injuries. Prosecutors said they did not believe the suspect was working with anyone else.



Wilders last week called off a planned contest for cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad following death threats and concerns other people could be put at risk. Prosecutors said the suspect did not mention the contest in his statements.

Wilders reacted with a tweet, writing: ""Muslim terrorists hate our way of life and our freedoms. They answer criticism of Islam with violence.""

The suspect, who was shot after the stabbings and was recovering from his injuries in a hospital, had applied for asylum in Germany and was not considered a security threat there, German officials said Monday.

An investigating judge extended the suspect's custody because of fears he may escape the region, repeat the crime or otherwise break the law, according to a statement by an Amsterdam court.

"More than a year and a half after the inauguration of Donald Trump’s presidency, the left continues to obstruct the confirmation of nominees to critical posts in both the executive and judicial branches. The unprecedented obstructionism denies leadership to executive branch departments and agencies and impedes the fair and swift administration of justice.

It is also an abuse of the Senate’s constitutional obligation to provide “Advice and Consent” regarding presidential nominations of judges and key “Officers of the United States.”

The Senate has a constitutional right and duty to ensure, through the confirmation process, that nominees have the education and professional experience necessary to qualify them for particular positions. No one questions that. And no one is arguing that the Senate is voting down unqualified nominees (yet).

But the obstruction campaign is a bad faith effort on the part of the left. It is designed solely to make it difficult for Trump to govern.

How bad is it? As of July 17, the Senate had confirmed 515 presidential nominations. That may sound like a lot, but it’s nearly 30 percent less than the number confirmed at this point in President Barack Obama’s first term.

And it’s not that Trump hasn’t given the upper chamber plenty of nominations to act on. A whopping 371 nominations are now pending in the Senate, including 90 judicial nominees.

So how is the left delaying votes? The Senate cannot vote on whether to confirm a nomination until it ends debate. Traditionally, the majority and minority parties cooperated on setting time limits for debate and scheduling confirmation votes. No more. And the only other way to end debate is the formal, time-consuming cloture process and requires 60 votes. A filibuster occurs when that attempt to end debate fails.

In 2013, Democrats succeeded in re-interpreting the cloture rule, effectively ending nomination filibusters by reducing the votes needed to end debate to a simple majority. Republicans extended that change to Supreme Court nominees in 2017.

This obstruction campaign is more about the president who is making the nominations than it is about the nominees themselves.

Cloture votes can no longer keep confirmation votes from happening, but they can still be used to drag out the confirmation process for days.

So far during the Trump era, the Senate has been forced to take 106 of these unnecessary cloture votes on executive and judicial branch nominations. At this point in Obama’s first term, there had been only 12 cloture votes on nominations. In fact, the Senate had taken a total of only 20 cloture votes on nominations at this point under the last 12 presidents combined.

How do we know that most of these cloture votes have nothing to do with the actual qualifications of nominees? That they are being used solely as an obstruction tactic? Because many of the nominees subjected to cloture votes wound up being easily confirmed—some unanimously. Three quick examples on the executive branch side: the Senate voted 70-23 to confirm Paul Ney, Jr., as general counsel of the Department of Defense; 69-24 to confirm Jelena McWilliams as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and 85-12 to confirm Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Yet “progressive” senators would not allow a confirmation vote on any of these eminently well-qualified nominees without going through the laborious cloture process.

On the judicial branch side, this year alone, 10 judicial nominees who had to go through cloture votes were ultimately confirmed with no opposition at all.

In addition to problems caused by leaving key executive branch and judicial seats empty, this procedural gamesmanship is unfair to good-spirited, patriotic Americans who are willing to serve the public yet have their lives, businesses, and careers put on hold while they wait, and wait, and wait.

For example, President Trump nominated our Heritage Foundation colleague Cully Stimson to be the general counsel of the Navy on June 6, 2017, more than 400 days ago. Cully’s credentials are impeccable. He is a former assistant U.S. attorney, deputy assistant secretary of defense, military judge, and Navy JAG captain with 25 years of military service. This delay is unjustified.

The situation at the Justice Department is increasingly desperate. The department has four major divisions that carry out its vital work: the Criminal Division, the Civil Division, the Environment and Natural Resources Division, and the Civil Rights Division. It took more than a year to confirm Brian Benczkowski just recently as Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, even though its work is essential to maintaining law and order. The other three divisions remain without Senate-confirmed leaders, even though nominees for those positions have been languishing for months.

Justice’s Civil Rights Division enforces laws against voting discrimination. Yet with Election Day less than four months away, the nomination of Eric Dreiband to head the division remains unconfirmed after more than a year. You couldn’t ask for a more qualified nominee than Dreiband, who enforced civil right laws as the general counsel of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and received awards for his service in the U.S. Department of Labor.

The nominees for the Civil Division and the Environment and Natural Resources Division, Jody Hunt and Jeffrey Clark, have also been waiting for months to get a confirmation vote.

It is time for this obstructionism to stop.

This obstruction campaign is more about the president who is making the nominations than it is about the nominees themselves. The government can’t function if the Senate is prevented from fulfilling its advice and consent obligation in a timely manner.

"Newly released surveillance footage of a 2016 scandal shows the moment a former senior official under the Obama administration was caught following a woman around on the D.C. Metro and taking a picture her up her skirt.

William Mendoza, an Education Department official serving as executive director of the White House initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native Education, resigned after being arrested and charged with attempted voyeurism in November 2016.

He reportedly was caught on a surveillance camera attempting to take the indecent photos during a probe by the Metro Police Transit Department.

New footage obtained by DailyMail.com shows the moment Mendoza followed an unsuspecting woman around the D.C. Metro on July 5, 2016.

He is seen closely trailing the woman with his phone in his hand. Mendoza follows her across a platform and even slows down to wait for her at the turnstiles. At one point he follows the woman up an escalator; a light can be seen coming from his phone, which he quickly attempts to put in his pocket.

The married father plead guilty in January 2017 was given a 90-day suspended jail sentence, one year of probation and a $100 fine.

Despite only pleading guilty to one count, Mendoza was allegedly accused of attempting to take upskirt photos at least four times on his government-issued phone in July 2016 but resigned before the Obama administration could complete its probe into his conduct.

"The “Medicare for All” plan pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and endorsed by a host of Democratic congressional and presidential hopefuls would increase government health care spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, according to a new study.

The Vermont senator has avoided conducting his own cost analysis, and those supporting the plan have at times struggled to explain how they could pay for it.

The study, released Monday by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, showed the plan would require historic tax increases.

The hikes would allow the government to replace what employers and consumers currently pay for health care -- delivering significant savings on administration and drug costs, but increased demand for care that would drive up spending, according to the report.

According to the report, the legislation’s federal health care commitments would reach approximately 10.7 of GDP by 2022, and rise to nearly 12.7 percent of GDP by 2031.

But the study, conducted by senior research strategist Charles Blahous, said that those estimates were on the “conservative” side.

Sanders’ plan builds on Medicare, the insurance program for seniors. The proposal would require all U.S. residents be covered with no copays and deductibles for medical services. The insurance industry would be regulated to play a minor role in the system.

Sanders is far from the only liberal lawmaker pushing the program.

2020 hopefuls like Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., endorsed a “Medicare for all” program last year.

Political newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who beat House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., in a recent upset primary and instantly became a prominent face of the democratic socialist movement, also is promoting a ""Medicare for all"" platform.

“Enacting something like ‘Medicare for all’ would be a transformative change in the size of the federal government,” Blahous, who was a senior economic adviser to former President George W. Bush and a public trustee of Social Security and Medicare during the Obama administration, said.

Blahous’ study also found that “a doubling of all currently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan.”

But Sanders blasted the analysis as “grossly misleading and biased,” noting that the Mercatus Center receives funding from the conservative Koch brothers. Koch Industries CEO Charles Koch is on the center’s board.

“If every major country on earth can guarantee health care to all, and achieve better health outcomes, while spending substantially less per capita than we do, it is absurd for anyone to suggest that the United States cannot do the same,” Sanders said in a statement. “This grossly misleading and biased report is the Koch brothers’ response to the growing support in our country for a ‘Medicare for all’ program.”

A spokesman for Sanders said that the senator’s office has not done a cost analysis on the new plan, however the estimates in the latest report are within the range for other cost projections for Sanders’ 2016 plan.

Sanders' staff found an error in an original version of the Mercatus report, which counted a long-term care program that was in the 2016 proposal but not the current one. Blahous corrected it, reducing his estimate by about $3 trillion over 10 years. Blahous says the report is his own work, not the Koch brothers'.

Also called ""single-payer"" over the years, ""Medicare for all"" reflects a long-time wish among liberals for a government-run system that covers all Americans.

The idea won broad rank-and-file support after Sanders ran on it in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. Looking ahead to the 2020 election, Democrats are debating whether single-payer should be a ""litmus test"" for national candidates.

The Mercatus analysis estimated the 10-year cost of ""Medicare for all"" from 2022 to 2031, after an initial phase-in. Its findings are similar to those of several independent studies of Sanders' 2016 plan. Those studies found increases in federal spending over 10 years that ranged from $24.7 trillion to $34.7 trillion.

The Mercatus study takes issue with a key cost-saving feature of the plan -- that hospitals and doctors will accept payment based on lower Medicare rates for all their patients.

The study found that the plan would reap substantial savings from lower prescription costs -- $846 billion over 10 years -- since the government would deal directly with drugmakers. Savings from streamlined administration would be even greater, nearly $1.6 trillion.

But other provisions of the plan are also expected to drive up spending, with coverage for nearly 30 million uninsured Americans, no copays and no deductibles and improved benefits on dental, vision and hearing.

The study estimated that doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes would not fully cover the additional costs.

"President Trump should adopt first lady Nancy Reagan’s famous anti-drug slogan in his current fight with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. When asked to testify in Mueller’s Russia probe, Trump should “just say no.”

Based on the Monday New York Times story headlined “The Questions Mueller Wants to Ask Trump About Obstruction, and What They Mean,” by Matt Apuzzo and Michael S. Schmidt, many of the questions Mueller wants to ask President Trump are absurd. They are clearly a trap to establish a case for obstruction of justice or perjury.

Virtually no one could answer these questions with any certainty of detail. Consider this one: “What did you think about Mr. Comey’s intelligence briefing on Jan. 6, 2017, about Russian election interference?”

President Trump has spent more than 400 days in office, and Mueller would like him to accurately recall his thoughts about a particular meeting on a particular day.

Remember, this is not a casual conversation. This is a criminal investigation seeking to use the full force of law to lock people up – just ask former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn or Vice President Dick Cheney’s former Chief of Staff Scooter Libby, who was trapped into perjuring himself during the Valerie Plame case.

Why would we think that a president who is currently handling North Korea, Iran, China, Russia, Syria, tax cuts, health care reform, state visits and other presidential duties is going to have the ability (or the time) to remember with absolute clarity and accuracy what happened 16 months ago?

You can be sure, Mueller will have interviewed everyone he could find who heard President Trump react to the meeting with Comey 16 months ago. Mueller will have transcripts of everything President Trump has said and tweeted about that meeting. He will have the endless interviews with Comey. Mueller will then listen to the president and use any error of memory or effort to embellish to manufacture an obstruction or perjury charge.

Ask yourself: Could you reliably remember every detail of a meeting you had at a particular time 16 months ago – and the totality of your reactions to it?

Why would we think that a president who is currently handling North Korea, Iran, China, Russia, Syria, tax cuts, health care reform, state visits and other presidential duties is going to have the ability (or the time) to remember with absolute clarity and accuracy what happened 16 months ago?

Mueller expands the absurdity with his follow-on question: “What was your reaction to Mr. Comey’s briefing that day about other intelligence matters?”

Consider how many intelligence briefings President Trump has received since then. Consider how many different conversations the president has had with a wide range of people about the so-called Steele dossier (reportedly the topic of that meeting). Again, Mueller will have interviewed people, recorded their versions, and will be prepared to measure the president’s memory against any slippage, error or misstatement.

Andy McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor who has written extensively and wisely on this case, warned in a recent column that “the rules of the game are that Democrats get away with murder while Republicans get murdered.”

McCarthy was comparing the treatment of the Obama campaign’s Federal Election Commission violations with what is being done to the Trump campaign. His analysis also applies to the effort to protect Hillary Clinton (no matter how many clear criminal actions she and her team have committed) with the elaborate effort to take down President Trump – no matter how often the left’s conspiracy theories fall apart.

Alan Dershowitz, a distinguished Harvard law professor and civil libertarian, has warned about prosecutors with a wide net who seek to entrap people: “It was Lavrentiy Beria (chief of the Soviet secret police) who told Stalin, ‘show me the man, and I’ll find your crime.’ You can go through the federal criminal code and find crimes that virtually any businessman, any politician has committed,” Dershowitz stated on MSNBC.

Dershowitz also warned: “I do not trust the government. I do not trust judges. I do not trust prosecutors when they are zealously seeking to go after a particular target, in this case Donald Trump. Nobody would have been going after Michael Cohen if he weren’t Donald Trump’s lawyer. That’s the reality.”

McCarthy made the case for Nancy Reagan’s “just say no” strategy in a column earlier this week, writing: “Trump would be foolish to answer questions from Mueller, who has made a habit of turning witness interviews into false-statements prosecutions. More important, absent concrete evidence of his complicity in a serious crime, a president should not be put in the position of being pressured to answer a prosecutor’s questions. When Trump complains that the Obama Justice Department would never have permitted President Obama to be treated this way, he is right….

“Unless Mueller can demonstrate that a serious crime has been committed, that Trump was complicit in it, and that Trump is in possession of evidence that is essential to the prosecution, (Deputy Attorney General Rod) Rosenstein should bar him from seeking an interview, let alone issuing a subpoena demanding grand-jury testimony. This is not merely about protecting Trump; it is about protecting the office of the presidency.”

Earlier in the piece, McCarthy pointed out that the questions Mueller reportedly wants to ask the president indicate that there is no evidence of a crime and that Mueller is just wanting to “probe the chief executive’s motives and thought processes regarding exercises of presidential power that were lawful.…”

McCarthy noted: “If Bob Mueller wants that kind of control over the executive branch, he should run for president. Otherwise, he is an inferior executive official who has been given a limited license – ultimately, by the chief executive – to investigate crime. If he doesn’t have an obvious crime, he has no business inventing one, much less probing his superior’s judgment. He should stand down.”

In an echo of Dershowitz’s reference to Stalin-era prosecutions, McCarthy warns: “The criminal law inquires into intent when actions patently violate criminal statutes; its purpose is not to manufacture crime by speculating about the intent behind apparently lawful actions.”

The patterns that McCarthy and Dershowitz describe are beginning to be more apparent. For example, a federal judge has accused Mueller’s team of using the case against former Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort to target the president.

According to Fox News, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III told Mueller’s team Friday: “You don't really care about Mr. Manafort…. You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever.""

Judge Ellis has questioned Mueller’s authority to prosecute Manafort on a number of charges related to an earlier Justice Department probe. He ordered Mueller to supply an unredacted document detailing the scope of Mueller’s investigation – the same document the Justice Department has previously declined to supply to House Republicans.

It is exactly this pattern of prosecutorial targeting that led former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now on the president’s legal defense team, to tell the Daily Beast: “Anybody who says that I’m exaggerating when I say that this is an out-of-control investigation and they’re acting like storm troopers – give me a break, baby! They prove it every day.”

""I contend the only crimes committed so far in this investigation are the ones they committed, the government committed,"" Giuliani added.

A close friend, who is a great litigator, suggested to me that President Trump should end the speculation with this statement:

""My lawyers tell me this is a farce, and when you see the proposed questions, you can see they are. So, I am not going to spend any time on it, and I am not going to answer their silly questions. I'll leave it all up to the lawyers to give you the legalese, and I am sure there will be plenty. But, that's for them. I have a great country to lead. So, just talk to them.""

“Just say no” is the only plausible answer to the Mueller fishing expedition.

Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein must finally do his job and stop Mueller from seeking to subpoena the president or take him before a grand jury. Mueller is only as outrageous and out of control as Rosenstein tolerates. So Rosenstein also has to learn from Nancy Reagan and “just say no” to Mueller’s power grab as well.",politics
"On the same day that President Trump slammed social media companies for what he claimed was a bias against conservative media, a bipartisan group of lawmakers went after Google’s CEO for refusing to testify next week on Capitol Hill.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai drew widespread criticism from senators of both parties after it was announced that he would not testify on Sept. 5 before the Senate Intelligence Committee, but instead would send Kent Walker, the company's senior vice president for global affairs, to the hearing.

“This is the United States Senate, this is an important issue, and we deserve to hear from the decision-makers, not the people who carry out the decisions,"" said Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, according to Bloomberg.

Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., who chairs the committee, said that Walker was not sufficiently high up in the tech company to provide testimony before Congress, but backed away from issuing a subpoena for Pichai to appear.

“I don’t normally subpoena people to be part of the solution,"" Burr said. ""Google chooses not to participate and being part of the solution. That’s a decision they made.”

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg have confirmed that they will be in Washington for the hearing.

The news of the bipartisan anger at Pichai’s declining to testify caps off a rough day for Google, after Trump launched an attack on the company with an early morning tweet accusing the tech giant’s search engine of being biased against conservative media and promising that the situation “will be addressed.”

Trump reiterated his warning Tuesday afternoon in the Oval Office, saying the companies are “taking advantage of people” and warning them to “be careful.”

“They better be careful because you can’t do that to people,” Trump told reporters following a meeting with officials from FIFA. “Google, Twitter and Facebook are treading on really troubled territory.”

Google has denied ranking results to ""manipulate"" political sentiment and said the company constantly works on its algorithms to ensure users get the highest quality content on the web.

""When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. ""Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology. Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.""

This is the first time Trump raised the issue of Google search engine’s alleged bias. Just weeks ago, Trump attacked other tech giants such as Twitter and Facebook for silencing non-left wing voices, saying “too many voices are being destroyed” and pledged to address the problem.

Facebook and Twitter have been under fire for allegedly censoring conservative and Republican accounts on their platforms, while taking a more lenient approach to liberal and left-wing users.

The president previously pointed to the problem of so-called “shadow banning” on social media platforms, where users, while technically not banned, found their posts invisible to most users.

A Google query for ""Trump News"" Tuesday afternoon, following the president’s remarks, showed stories from CNN, The New York Times, Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, among others.

Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. But, while some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias, and indeed no such bias has been proven.

Trump didn't say what he based his tweets on. But in a blog post over the weekend, conservative activist Paula Boylard had said she found ""blatant prioritization of left-leaning and anti-Trump media outlets"" in search results.

Boylard based her judgments on which media outlets were left- or right-leaning on a list by Sharyl Attkisson, host of Sinclair Television's ""Full Measure"" and author of ""The Smear: How Shady Political Operatives and Fake News Control What You See, Think, and How You Vote."" Sinclair is a significant outlet for conservative views.

"President Trump on Saturday threatened to “get involved” in the fight by a conservative watchdog to obtain text messages by fired deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe related to his wife’s 2015 state senate campaign.

""Why isn’t the FBI giving Andrew McCabe text messages to Judicial Watch or appropriate governmental authorities,” he tweeted.

“FBI said they won’t give up even one (I may have to get involved, DO NOT DESTROY). What are they hiding? McCabe wife took big campaign dollars from Hillary people.....”

Judicial Watch has been fighting to gain access to McCabe’s messages related to his wife Jill’s 2015 Virginia state senate campaign. The Wall Street Journal first reported in October 2016 that Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee , gave nearly $467,500 to her campaign. The Virginia Democratic Party spent an addition $207,788 on the campaign.

The revelation raised concerns that the substantial donation biased the former deputy director and had an impact on the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, Jill McCabe responded to the claims, noting that her husband’s involvement in the Clinton probe came after the race was over.

“Now that I can speak on my own behalf, I want people to know that the whole story that everything is based on is just false and utterly absurd,” she said.

Andrew McCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March after the Justice Department’s inspector general found that he made an “unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor -- including under oath -- on multiple occasions.”

Trump has since returned to raising questions about the 2015 donations on multiple occasions as part of his broadsides against the FBI and its investigations into both Clinton’s emails and Russian interference in the 2016 election.

On Saturday, in a follow-up tweet, he asked if the FBI will “ever recover it’s once stellar reputation” and said it was damaged by top FBI officials, including former FBI Director James Comey, McCabe and officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.

Anti-Trump texts between Page and Strzok, who was involved in both the Clinton and the Russia probe, have raised further questions about possible political bias within the FBI.",politics

"The Egyptian hotel room where a British couple died had a ""strange odor"" inside, an Egyptian official revealed Tuesday, as investigators continue to probe what led to the deaths.

Maj. Gen. Ahmed Abdullah, governor of Egypt's Red Sea region where the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel is located, said ""there was a strange odor in the room,"" according to Sky News.

John and Susan Cooper died last Tuesday morning while on vacation at the hotel in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Hurghada. The deaths of the couple, ages 69 and 63, prompted travel company Thomas Cook to evacuate 300 guests from the hotel as a precaution.

The room remains sealed off while engineers inspect ventilation and air conditioning systems, according to Abdullah, who added that the Coopers' bodies will be analyzed by a forensic laboratory in Cairo.

The governor added that only 23 of the hotel's 1,995 guests visited the on-site clinic or requested medical assistance in the last week, adding that those who felt unwell had stomach cramps from swallowing seawater or spent too much time in the sun.

The couple's daughter, Kelly Ormerod, has said she is suspicious because her parents had been in perfect health hours before they died. She previously told Sky News that her father, John Cooper, died in his room while her mother died after she was taken to the hospital.

""I think when they went back to that room that evening there was something in that room that's actually killed them -- whether they've inhaled something that poisoned them, I don't know,"" she told Sky News. ""I can only have my opinion on what's gone on, but there's something that happened in that room that killed my parents.""

BRITISH COUPLE DIES IN EGYPT HOTEL, DAUGHTER SAYS 'SOMETHING IN THAT ROOM' KILLED PARENTS

On Sunday, Thomas Cook Group CEO Peter Fankhauser told Sky News the company has brought in experts to test food, water and air conditioning systems at the Egyptian resort hotel.

""There is no evidence that it is a carbon monoxide poisoning. We have no evidence, but I don't want to rule out anything before I really know the cause,"" he said.

Fankhauser told Sky News that experts have taken ""probes of the food, of the hygienic systems, of water, as well as the air conditioning systems and all those probes are now in Egypt,"" and that tests should take 10 days to complete.

Egyptian authorities dismissed criminal motives as being behind the deaths. An official statement by the Red Sea governorate on Friday said an initial medical examination of John Cooper showed he had suffered acute circulatory collapse and a sudden cardiac arrest. It said Susan Cooper later fainted and was rushed to a hospital, where resuscitation attempts continued for a half-hour.

"An employee of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agreed to resign this week after admitting she posted more than 100 social media messages during work hours or on agency property in 2016, urging people to vote for Hillary Clinton.

The disclosure came in a news release from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC).

The agreement between the employee and the OSC includes a five-year ban from working in the federal government, the statement said.

The posts were considered a violation of the federal Hatch Act, which prohibits most government employees from engaging in most political activities while on duty, the release said.

The woman continued the behavior despite being approached by ethics watchdogs, the OSC said.

“When a federal employee emphatically and repeatedly engages in political activity while on duty or in the workplace, OSC takes that very seriously,” Special Counsel Henry J.

"Pentagon and NATO brass have issued fresh warnings about increased Russian naval activity in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, with the top U.S. Navy admiral saying this week Russian submarine operations are currently at levels not seen since the Cold War.

That’s one reason the Navy plans to stand up a new command later this month to deal with the return of an old foe.

Tuesday night provided the latest example of Russia’s new show of force. A British Type 45 guided-missile destroyer escorted two Russian warships through the English Channel.

The Royal Navy posted video of HMS Diamond alongside the Russian destroyer Severomorsk and cruisier Marshal Ustinov in the English Channel. Interactions like this have become so common, the Royal Navy has warships standing 24-hour alert in port.

The incident took place one day after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met with his British counterpart, Gavin Williamson, at the Pentagon. It marked the second time the same British warship had responded to approaching Russian Navy warships, according to the warship’s commanding officer.

This week, the U.S. Navy’s highest ranking officer, Adm. John Richardson, chief of naval operations, told VOA Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic is ""more than we've seen in 25 years.”

But a day later, Mattis downplayed the perceived threat from the Russian Navy.

“We always keep an eye on the submarines at sea and I prefer not to say any more than that,” Mattis told reporters on the Pentagon steps ahead of Williamson's visit.

A recent Russian missile test provided another example of Russia’s resurgence at sea.

Two months before the Helsinki summit, a Russian ballistic missile submarine launched four long-range nuclear missiles in rapid succession from off the coast of Russia in the White Sea, each with a range of 6,000 miles – putting Washington, D.C. in range. U.S. spy satellites took note of the test, which marked the first time Russia had fired this many missiles at once from its newest class of ballistic missile submarine.

Observers said tensions are high right now between Moscow and Washington, despite the summit in Helsinki last month. On Wednesday, the U.S. said it would impose sanctions on Russia over a nerve agent attack.

“I think Russia is signaling to us that the Bear is back. We are likely to see more of this intimidating, threatening operations on the part of the Russian fleet,” said Peter Brookes, a senior fellow for national security affairs at the Heritage Foundation. “This is an expression of President Putin's foreign policy and it’s directed towards the United States.”

U.S. officials are concerned special Russian submarines can tap into undersea cables.

Days ahead of the landmark summit between Cold War foes, President Trump signaled a willingness to ease tensions despite his top intelligence officials accusing Russia of meddling in the 2016 election.

“Maybe we will get along with Russia,” the president said at a news conference on July 12. “I think we probably will be able to.”

A week after the Helsinki summit, Trump told CNBC if things didn’t work out, “I'll be the worst enemy he's ever had,” speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Since Russian forces deployed to Syria three years ago, Russian submarines in the Mediterranean have at times launched missiles to help crush the rebellion battling the Assad regime.

The increased Russian threat is one of the reasons the U.S. Navy is bringing back the 2nd Fleet later this month in Norfolk, Va. to keep tabs on the Russians in the Atlantic.

"Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who died Saturday after a battle with aggressive brain cancer, served more than 30 years in the U.S. Senate and was an ardent supporter of the armed forces.

The senator, who was tortured while he spent nearly five and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, was “larger than life,” Tom Callender, a Navy affairs analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a think-tank based in Washington D.C., told Fox News.

""There will be a void for a long time.” - Tom Callender

“While there will be others [like him], there will be a void for a long time,” Callender said. ""Someone will rise, but it will not be the same. It’s tough to fill those shoes.”

Here's a look back at McCain's military career.

McCain’s military roots

McCain was born Aug. 29, 1936, at a military air base in the Panama Canal Zone, which, according to the History Channel, was under American control at the time.

McCain, the son of a four-star Navy admiral, spent the majority of his childhood on naval bases along with his older sister Sandy and younger brother Joe.

After graduating in 1954 from an Episcopal boarding school in Virginia, McCain attended the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1958.

McCain’s interest in the military came naturally: His father, John S. McCain Jr., was a decorated Navy admiral, as was Sen. McCain’s paternal grandfather, John S. McCain Sr.

His grandfather and father, who both served during World War II, retired with a four-star rank, Callender said.

The USS John S. McCain was named after both his grandfather and father. In August 2017, the ship was involved in a collision near Singapore, killing 10 sailors.

“[McCain] came from a naval aristocracy,” Dr. John Sherwood, a naval historian at the Naval History and Heritage Command, told Fox News.

McCain’s father, who was a submariner during World War II, also served in the Vietnam War. At that time, John S. McCain Jr. was in charge of all U.S. military forces in the Pacific Ocean, Callender said, even leading bombing missions on Hanoi while his son was a prisoner of war.

“There was always a chance a bomb could land where his son was,” Callender said. “But he had to do his job.”

“Being in command of all U.S. forces in the Pacific and the stress of maybe his son being killed — it took a lot of balance. But he did so with honor,” Sherwood added.

A 'reckless, adventurous' youth to a 'changed man'

McCain was a “rule breaker at the [Naval] Academy,” Callender said, adding that McCain graduated with a low-class rank.

After graduating from flight school in 1960, McCain flew with the VA-65 squadron on the aircraft carriers USS Intrepid and USS Enterprise.

McCain, who at this point in his life was still a bit reckless, Callender said, had three non-combat-related crashes during this time — once flying too low over a town in southern Spain, colliding with power lines. However, he escaped the accident relatively unscathed.

In another close call, McCain crashed his plane into Corpus Christi Bay.

“A notable aspect of his naval aviation career was luck,” Sherwood said.

“If he had been any other pilot, [the Navy] might’ve not given him another chance,” Callender said.

More than anything, Sherwood said, it was McCain’s time in the Naval Academy that helped him prepare to be a POW, though he didn’t know it at the time. Sherwood added the academy was a “rough place” where students were expected to balance the “rigorous academic and physical programs” in addition to socializing and “making a name for themselves” among their fellow shipmen.

McCain’s hasty demeanor changed after he spent five and a half years as a POW during the Vietnam War, Callender said.

“He was a changed man,"" he added.

Combat duty and time as a prisoner of war

In the 1960s, McCain volunteered for combat duty during the Vietnam War, during which time he flew carrier-based attack planes.

After surviving a massive fire onboard the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal that killed 134 sailors, McCain transferred to VA 163. While conducting a bombing run on Hanoi later that same year, his plane was shot down. McCain landed in a nearby lake, breaking both of his arms and one of his legs in the crash. He nearly drowned before Northern Vietnamese soldiers captured him, Callender said.

“Before he was shot down, he received a warning that a missile had been shot against him. He ignored the warning because he thought he could outmaneuver the missile,” Sherwood said.

Moments after being captured, one of the soldiers “slammed a rifle butt down on my shoulder, and smashed it pretty badly. Another stuck a bayonet in my foot. The mob was really getting uptight,” McCain later recalled in an essay.

McCain was moved to Hoa Lo prison, more commonly known at the time as “Hanoi Hilton.”

Eventually, McCain’s North Vietnamese captors discovered he was the son of a well-known admiral and offered to let him go. But McCain refused.

“He knew it would be powerful propaganda to show that [the Northern Vietnamese] were merciful,” Callender said, adding that McCain refused to break Article III of the Military Code of Conduct — to ""accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy."" Captured American soldiers are directed to give the enemy only their name, rank and serial number.

McCain told his captors he would accept freedom only if the other POWs — many of whom had been there long before him — were released as well, Callender said. But his request was denied.

From there, McCain was severely tortured, did not receive proper medical treatment for his injuries and was forced into two years of solitary confinement, Callender said.

“That was common back then — they did not get him good medical treatment for a long time,” Callender said, adding that McCain was not fed well and lived in deplorable conditions during his time as a POW.

“He was by far in the worst condition out of everyone who arrived there,” Sherwood added. “It’s a testament to his heroism.”

In March 1973, after years of torture, McCain and other POWs were released. He later received the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart and Distinguished Flying Cross.

“It changed him,” Callender said. That experience taught him “everyone has a breaking point.”

Even in the harsh conditions, McCain remained even-keeled through the whole experience, even boosting the morale of his fellow POWs, Sherwood said.

""It changed him."" - Tom Callender, on McCain's time as a POW

“As a historian, I always found it interesting that he didn't really talk about it [his time as a POW] unless asked,” Sherwood said, suggesting McCain’s mentality was different than that of many other former POWs he’s studied. “He saw it as part of his service to the country, and didn’t want to dwell on past service but what he could do today, here and now.”

Return to duty

Aside from the mental impact, McCain’s time as a POW left him physically changed as well, meaning he could have been medically discharged from the Navy.

But he wanted to fly again.

After months of intensive physical therapy, McCain was selected as commanding officer at Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Fla.

There, McCain led attack squadron VA 174 and was tasked with training new pilots to fly an A7 aircraft, a heavier attack aircraft than the ones McCain flew during the Vietnam War.

When McCain first arrived, the squadron was known for its poor safety record, among other things. But McCain wanted to change its reputation — and he did, Callender said.

“He reassigned people, took parts from broken aircraft to fix others — it was his forceful personality and sheer will that dragged his command along. It ended up being a drastic improvement.”

Under McCain’s command, the squadron won the Aviation Safety Award for having the most number of flight hours without an accident, Callender said.

Callender said McCain’s leadership during this time proved “his ability to get people to do things.”

A new chapter

In 1976, McCain started his “next chapter,"" Callender said. That year, he was appointed to be the Navy’s liaison to the U.S. Senate, a position he served in until 1981.

“He saw how he could help the Navy from that angle,” Callender said, adding that McCain was a huge proponent of a strong military from the moment he stepped into the role.

Later, McCain was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and then the U.S. Senate. During this time in his career, McCain earned the nickname ""Maverick"" for his willingness to disagree with his party on critical issues. (For instance, McCain famously disagreed with President Ronald Reagan’s decision to deploy more troops to Lebanon in 1983.)

“McCain opposed Reagan’s decision because he felt that the troops wouldn’t have enough tools and support to win — much like in Vietnam,” Callender said. “[He was] always breaking the rules and pushing boundaries for what he felt was important.""

National Defense Authorization Act

In 2017, McCain, who served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was a key player behind the National Defense Authorization Act.

President Trump signed the Act on Dec. 12, 2017. It was one of McCain’s last efforts to rebuild the military, thus making the legislation so poignant, Callender said.

“As we move forward with consideration of the NDAA, I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this important legislation and give our military the resources they need and deserve. We ask a lot of our men and women in uniform, and they never let us down. We must not let them down. Their service represents the best of our country, and this Congress should always honor their sacrifice,” McCain said on the Senate floor in September 2017.

One of the 'great naval figures of the 20th century'



McCain had “tough” legacies to live up to, Callender said, citing the senator's father and grandfather. But “he always felt he could do more good on the politics side.""

Overall, Callender thinks McCain did more in Congress for the military than he ever could’ve done by staying in the Navy.

“His legacy will be felt much more than his grandfather’s or father’s as time goes on,” Callender said.

McCain is ""one of the great naval figures of the 20th century and someone who the Navy looks up to today as a symbol of heroism and a symbol of the sailor triumphing over adversity,” Sherwood added.

In the end, McCain “may not have had the impact he’s had if it had not been for his experiences,"" Callender said. ""He has never been what people want to hear. But whether you agreed with him or not, he was always fighting for what he believed and what he was passionate about.""",politics
"Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team was one holdout juror away from winning a conviction against Paul Manafort on all 18 counts of bank and tax fraud, juror Paula Duncan told Fox News in an exclusive interview Wednesday.

“It was one person who kept the verdict from being guilty on all 18 counts,” Duncan, 52, said. She added that Mueller’s team of prosecutors often seemed bored, apparently catnapping during parts of the trial.

The identities of the jurors have been closely held, kept under seal by Judge T.S. Ellis III at Tuesday's conclusion of the high-profile trial.

But Duncan gave a behind-the-scenes account to Fox News on Wednesday, after the jury returned a guilty verdict against the former Trump campaign chairman on eight financial crime counts and deadlocked on 10 others.

Duncan described herself as an avid supporter of President Trump, but said she was moved by four full boxes of exhibits provided by Mueller’s team – though she was skeptical about prosecutors' motives in the financial crimes case.

“Certainly Mr. Manafort got caught breaking the law, but he wouldn’t have gotten caught if they weren’t after President Trump,” Duncan said of the special counsel’s case, which she separately described as a “witch hunt to try to find Russian collusion,” borrowing a phrase Trump has used in tweets more than 100 times.

“Something that went through my mind is, this should have been a tax audit,” Duncan said, sympathizing with the foundation of the Manafort defense team’s argument.

She described a tense and emotional four days of deliberations, which ultimately left one juror holding out. Behind closed doors, tempers flared at times, even though jurors never explicitly discussed Manafort’s close ties to Trump.

“It was a very emotionally charged jury room – there were some tears,” Duncan said about deliberations with a group of Virginians she didn’t feel included many “fellow Republicans.”

A political allegiance to the president also raised conflicted feelings in Duncan, but she said it ultimately didn’t change her decision about the former Trump campaign chairman.

“Finding Mr. Manafort guilty was hard for me. I wanted him to be innocent, I really wanted him to be innocent, but he wasn’t,” Duncan said. “That’s the part of a juror, you have to have due diligence and deliberate and look at the evidence and come up with an informed and intelligent decision, which I did.”

Duncan, a Missouri native and mother of two, showed Fox News her two notebooks with her juror number #0302 on the covers.

In the interview, Duncan also described how the special counsel’s prosecutors apparently had a hard time keeping their eyes open.

“A lot of times they looked bored, and other times they catnapped – at least two of them did,” Duncan said. “They seemed very relaxed, feet up on the table bars and they showed a little bit of almost disinterest to me, at times.”

The jury box was situated in a corner of the courtroom that gave them an unobstructed head-on view of the prosecutors and defense, while members of the media and the public viewed both parties from behind.

COULD MANAFORT COOPERATE WITH MUELLER'S TEAM? A LOOK AT HIS OPTIONS AFTER THE GUILTY VERDICT

Judge Ellis told jurors, including Duncan, that their names would remain sealed after the trial’s conclusion, because of dangerous threats he received during the proceedings.

But the verdict gave Duncan a license to share her story without fear.

“Had the verdict gone any other way, I might have been,” Duncan said.

MANAFORT CONVICTED ON BANK AND TAX FRAUD CHARGES

Her account of the deliberations is no longer a secret. And neither is the pro-Trump apparel she kept for a long drive to the federal courthouse in Alexandria every day.

“Every day when I drove, I had my Make America Great Again hat in the backseat,” said Duncan, who said she plans to vote for Trump again in 2020. “Just as a reminder.”

"China's largest ride-hailing company suspended one of its carpooling services and fired two executives on Sunday after a woman was raped and killed by a driver last week.

Didi Chuxing said in a statement it was “immensely saddened by the tragedy"" and will halt its ""Hitch"" service on its platform starting on Monday.

“We are deeply sorry. We fell short of your expectations. We can’t and we won’t shirk from our responsibilities,” the company statement said, according to Reuters.

The 20-year-old woman was in the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou when she got into a Didi carpool vehicle at 1 p.m. on Friday and then sent a message to a friend at 2 p.m. seeking help before losing contact. Police said the suspect, a 27-year-old driver called Zhong, was found at about 4 a.m. on Saturday and confessed to raping and killing the woman.

Didi Chuxing has since apologized, saying it has ""inescapable responsibility"" for the incident and that it failed to respond promptly to a possible warning sign about the driver. In a statement, the company acknowledged that it received a complaint a day earlier from another passenger about the driver involved in the killing.

YELLOW CABS NOW HAVE THEIR OWN UBER-LIKE APP

That passenger had complained that the driver repeatedly asked her to sit in the front, drove to a remote spot, and followed her for a while even after she got out of the car, the company said.

""The incident shows the many deficiencies with our customer service processes,"" the company said.

Didi Chuxing is China's largest online ride-hailing platform and has 30 million rides booked daily. It acquired Uber's China business in 2016.

The killing of the female passenger on Friday was the latest violent crime involving a Didi driver, only three months after another driver allegedly killed a flight attendant.

After that incident sparked social media backlash, the company suspended and changed Didi Hitch, according to the BBC.

"As a medic for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Jhony Guependo saved a comrade who stepped on a land mine from bleeding to death. He also stitched up guerrilla fighters who had injured themselves with machetes while building camps deep in Colombia's rainforest.

But Guependo, 25, says he never had any formal medical training. The former rebel is now trying to fix that, and build a new life for himself, by studying medicine in Cuba.

""I was always known for being good at healing people,"" Guependo said, just a few hours before departing for Havana on his first ever international flight. ""Now I want to become a doctor so that I can help vulnerable people.""

Two hundred young Colombians will travel this year to Cuba to pursue medical degrees, including 22 former FARC rebels, as part of a scholarship program that is financed by the island's communist government. The first batch of scholarship recipients left on a flight for Cuba on Tuesday.

It is being rolled out as Colombia strives to find new occupations for former rebel fighters, who in many cases lack formal schooling and have spent most of their lives in guerrilla camps.

""It's a tough transition,"" says Guependo, who joined the guerrillas 10 years ago when he was 15. ""But I would encourage my comrades to stick with this, because war doesn't offer us any solutions now.""

More than 6,000 rebels laid down their guns after Colombia and the FARC signed a peace deal that includes reduced sentences or legal benefits for guerrilla leaders and guaranteed representation in the country's congress.

But finding jobs for the rank and file has been a challenge and in some areas of the country former rebels have reportedly abandoned transition camps to join criminal organizations.

Participants in the Cuban government's medical scholarship scheme have said they would like to return to Colombia after completing their degrees, and serve in remote communities where doctors are few and far between.

Scholarships were also offered to dozens of young men and women from remote areas of the country who were not combatants, but whose families do not have enough money to send them to universities in Colombia.

""I want to be the first person in my family with a college degree,"" said Johan Arenas, a 19-year-old from the southern province of Meta who was admitted into the program.

Arenas says his family was forced to flee their hometown at the turn of the century due to fighting between the guerrillas and paramilitary groups. But he said he had no problems with having former guerrilla members as his new colleagues, because ""resentment doesn't mix well with peace.""

For Guependo, the former FARC medic, it will be his first time leaving Colombia.

""It will be sad to leave everyone behind,"" Guependo said. ""But in life you have to make sacrifices to become someone and chart a new path for yourself.""",world
"Survivors of sexual abuse are criticizing Pope Francis' opening speech during the first papal visit to Ireland in almost four decades.

The pontiff's comments were seen as a “staggering effort at deflection” that ignored the Vatican’s own role in fueling a culture of cover-up for predator priests.

Following Francis' speech to Irish government authorities on Saturday, survivors of priestly sex abuse expressed their disappointment in the pontiff's words.

Colm O’Gorman, who is leading a solidarity rally Sunday in Dublin for abuse victims, said Francis’ remarks about the shame felt by Catholics were an “insult to faithful Catholics, who have no reason to feel shame because of the crimes of the Vatican and the institutional church.”

Anne Barrett Doyle, co-founder of the online resource Bishop Accountability, said Francis “gave little comfort to heartsick victims” since he provided no details on how he would end the problem, since he alone can sanction complicit bishops.

In his speech, Francis cited measures taken by his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, to respond to the clergy abuse crisis. But he provided no new indications that he would take forceful action to hold bishops accountable for protecting children or to sanction them when they fall short.

Francis said: “The failure of ecclesial authorities ... to adequately address these repugnant crimes has rightly given rise to outrage, and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community. I myself share these sentiments.”

A small group of protesters demonstrated against the pope’s visit outside Dublin Castle, with one banner reading: “Pedophile supporters go home.”

POPE FRANCIS, ADDRESSING CATHOLIC CHURCH SEX ABUSE SCANDAL, BEGS FOR FORGIVENESS, DEMANDS ACCOUNTABILITY

Francis is also expected to meet with victims during his 36-hour visit to Dublin. But neither Francis' words nor a new meeting with victims is likely to calm the outrage among rank-and-file Catholics in Ireland and abroad following new revelations of sexual misconduct and cover-up in the U.S., an ongoing crisis in Chile and prosecutions of top clerics in Australia and France.

Ireland has had one of the worst records of abuse in the world, crimes that were revealed to its 4.8 million deeply Catholic people over the past decade by a series of government-mandated inquiries. They revealed thousands of children raped and molested by priests and physically abused in church-run schools, and bishops who covered up the crimes.

After the Irish church atoned for its past and enacted tough new norms to fight abuse, it had been looking to the first visit by a pope in 40 years to show a different, more caring church that understands the problems of ordinary Catholic families today.

More than 37,000 people — most of them young Catholics — signed up to attend this week's Vatican-sponsored World Meeting of Families in Dublin, more than twice as many as the previous edition of the family rally in Philadelphia three years ago.

POPE FRANCIS REPORTEDLY TELLS GAY MAN, 'GOD MADE YOU THAT WAY AND LOVES YOU'

And many faithful are hopeful.

""I see a lot of new life amongst young people who have a deep committed faith, Catholic faith,"" said Sean Ascogh, a churchgoer at a recent service in Blessington southwest of Dublin. ""Obviously they are very disappointed by what has been happening in the church in the last few years, particularly the whole abuse scandals, but I think people can see beyond that.""

But Ireland's tortured history of abuse has left its mark.

In a country where Catholic bishops held such sway that they advised the drafters of the republic's constitution in the 1930s, voters in recent years have turned their backs on core Catholic teachings. They have overturned a constitutional ban on abortion and legalized divorce, homosexuality, contraception and same-sex marriage.

Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who will welcome Francis at Dublin Castle on Saturday, is openly gay.

Irish abuse victims and their supporters are expected to hold a solidarity rally on Sunday in Dublin, at the same time Francis is celebrating his final Mass to close out the family conference.

Separately, survivors of Ireland's wretched ""mother and baby homes"" — where children were exiled for the shame of having been born to unwed mothers — are holding their own demonstration Sunday. The location is Tuam, site of a mass grave of hundreds of babies who died over the years at a church-run home.

Francis will be nearby, visiting the Marian shrine at Knock, but has no plans to visit the grave site.

On the eve of Francis' arrival in Dublin, Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley — the pope's top abuse counselor — said protecting children and vulnerable adults is now the single most crucial issue facing the church.

""All endeavors at evangelization and other great works will be dependent upon our ability to own our crimes and failings and to make the protection of children and vulnerable adults our No. 1 priority,"" O'Malley said in a statement read out to a safeguarding panel at the World Meeting of Families.

O'Malley had been expected to headline the panel in person, but he backed out at the last minute, citing a new inquiry he launched into his diocesan seminary amid sexual misconduct allegations — one of three big U.S. seminaries that have launched such investigations in recent weeks.

Irish abuse survivor and advocate Marie Collins, who resigned in frustration from O'Malley's board last year, told the safeguarding panel that if Francis claims to be on the side of victims, the Catholic Church should no longer lobby to block the ability of victims to sue and prosecute abusers after the statute of limitations expires.

""The actions of the church do not match the words, and they are in fact totally the opposite,"" Collins said. She called for ""robust structures"" and strong sanctions to hold accountable bishops and even Vatican officials who fail protect children.

"In his more than three decades of service on Capitol Hill, Sen. John McCain was known for many things: his dedication to the United States, his passion and his temper, his strong convictions, and, maybe most notably, his ability to work across the aisle to get results.

That dedication to bipartisanship was on full display in the hours following McCain’s death at age 81 on Saturday after a yearlong battle with brain cancer as tributes from Democratic colleagues and rivals began to pour in.

“Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did,” Former President Barack Obama said in a statement. “But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own. At John’s best, he showed us what that means. And for that, we are all in his debt.”

Obama, who beat McCain in the 2008 race for the White House, said that despite their differences, McCain and he shared a ""fidelity to something higher — the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched and sacrificed.""

Obama said they ""saw our political battles, even, as a privilege, something noble, an opportunity to serve as stewards of those high ideals at home, and to advance them around the world.""

Speaking on NBC’s ""Meet The Press,” former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said “we could all talk for hours about what he meant to the country.”

“He leaves a legacy of service and courage,” Clinton said of McCain. “The courage we all came to know as a POW, but getting up every day and working for the people of Arizona wasn't easy.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden, who served with McCain in the Senate for more than 20 years, also issued a heartfelt statement about his longtime colleague and friend.

“John McCain will cast a long shadow,” Biden said. “His impact on America hasn’t ended. Not even close. It will go on for many years to come.”

Biden added: “America will miss John McCain. The world will miss John McCain. And I will miss him dearly.”

Many commentators noted that McCain represented a statesman who was unafraid to cross party lines to achieve his goals and, that in the country’s current political climate, this ability will be missed.

But Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate over the weekend brushed aside these criticisms of their work and instead focused on their own friendships and dealings with McCain.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised McCain’s service both in the Armed Forces and on Capitol Hill and also said he would introduce legislation to rename the Russell Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C., after McCain.

“As you go through life, you meet few truly great people,” Schumer said in a statement. “John McCain was one of them. His dedication to his country and the military were unsurpassed, and maybe most of all, he was a truth teller -- never afraid to speak truth to power in an era where that has become all too rare.

He added: “The Senate, the United States, and the world are lesser places without John McCain.”

Schumer’s counterpart in the House, Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on ABC’s ""This Week"" that McCain was a “source of great strength to our country.”

“I’m heartbroken,” she added. “America is in tears for the loss of this great man.”

McCain is expected to be honored in Arizona and Washington before being buried, likely this coming week, at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland.",politics
"President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani said Sunday that special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia collusion is “rigged” and that investigators are focusing “on things that didn’t happen.”

“Let’s get the facts straight, and let’s get this done,” Giuliani said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Giuliani said the investigation is focusing on “things that didn’t happen” -- including members of the Trump presidential campaign allegedly colluding with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential race and Trump illegally interfering with the probe.

“You’ve got a focus of no Russia collusion, no obstruction of justice,” Giuliani said.

Trump critics say the president obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James Comey.

Trump fired Comey in May 2017, saying he'd lost confidence in Comey’s ability to manage the FBI, including how he handled the federal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of private email servers while secretary of state.

However, the president was also upset that Comey would not publicly say he was not the focus of the Russia investigation, an argument Giuliani has made in recent days.

Trump appears increasingly frustrated about the investigation -- which he routinely calls a “witch hunt” -- as the probe extends into a second year and interferes with his administration.

Giuliani was hired in recent weeks to try to bring the investigation to a close and perhaps arrange an interview between Trump and Mueller, as a final step.

However, he and others on Trump’s legal team have been wary about allowing Trump to talk, for fear federal investigators might try to set a legal trap.

“We’re not going to sit him down if it’s a trap for perjury,” Giuliani said Sunday. “He wants to explain that he did nothing wrong.”

To be sure, Trump has consistently said he didn’t meddle with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. And he argued that the investigation has moved beyond its original intent to include the business dealings of the president’s business associates.

“This is rigged, you’ve got 13 Democrats, no collusion,” Giuliani said. “They are focused on things that didn't happen.”

He also said the president is ""not going to fire anybody"" because that would make him look like a victim.

Giuliani also said that the former administration should have informed Trump that it was looking at Russia meddling during the 2016 race and was surveilling his campaign.

“Some of it is Mueller's fault (but) it completely taints his investigation,” Giuliani said. “The whole thing with this investigation that was going on, which we consider spying, was done before Mueller got involved. But it completely taints his investigation.”",politics

"Authorities in Britain charged two Russian men on Wednesday with the nerve agent poisoning of ex-Russian spy and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury earlier this year, saying the pair used a fake perfume bottle involved in another poisoning that left a woman dead but offered little hope to bring them to justice.

The Crown Prosecution Service said the men, identified as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are charged with conspiracy to murder, attempted murder and use of the nerve agent Novichok for the March attacks.

Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a public bench in the city of Salisbury on March 4, and spent weeks in critical condition. Officials suspect the father and daughter were poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-engineered nerve agent.

Prime Minister Theresa May told lawmakers that British intelligence has concluded that the two men are officers of Russia's GRU military intelligence service.

May said the attack ""was not a rogue operation"" and was almost certainly approved at a ""senior level of the Russian state.""

Prosecutor Sue Hemming said the U.K. is not asking Moscow to extradite the men because Russian law forbids extradition of the country's citizens.

“We have, however, obtained a European Arrest Warrant which means that if either man travels to a country where an EAW is valid, they will be arrested and face extradition on these charges for which there is no statute of limitations,"" Hemming said in a statement.

Police said the men, both about 40, flew from Moscow to London on Russian passports two days before the Skripals were poisoned. Assistant police commissioner Neil Basu said the men were probably using aliases. He appealed the public ""to come forward and tell us who they are,"" but conceded it was ""very very unlikely"" police would be in a position to arrest them any time soon.

The nerve agent used to poison the Skripals was smuggled to Britain in a counterfeit Nina Ricci perfume bottle and applied to the front door of Sergei Skripal's house, according to Metropolitan Police.

UK MAN POISONED BY NOVICHOK NERVE AGENT NOT ‘LOOKING GOOD,’ BROTHER SAYS

More than three months later, the bottle was found by a local man, Charlie Rowley. He was hospitalized and his girlfriend Dawn Sturgess died after being exposed to the contents. Met Police said it did not believe the pair were deliberately targeted, but ""became victims as a result of the recklessness in which such a toxic nerve agent was disposed of.""

""Let me be clear, we have no doubt these incidents are connected,"" Basu said during a news conference on Wednesday.

Police released a series of images of the men as they traveled through London and Salisbury between March 2 and March 4. Police say the two men flew back to Moscow from Heathrow Airport on the evening of March 4, hours after the Skripals were found collapsed on a park bench in Salisbury.

EX-RUSSIAN SPY SERGEI SKRIPAL'S POISONING: WHAT TO KNOW

Yulia, 33, recovered more quickly and was discharged in April. Her father was released from the hospital in May. The police officer who came to their assistance, and was hospitalized, has also been released.

The Skripals have been taken to an undisclosed location for their safety.

After the announcement by British authorities, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the names of the two suspects ""do not mean anything to us,"" according to Sky News. Britain later summoned a Russian diplomat in London after naming the two suspects, according the RIA news agency reported.

Sergei Skripal served with Russia’s military intelligence agency, often known by its Russian-language acronym GRU, and retired in 1999. He then worked at the Foreign Ministry until 2003, and later became involved in business.

DAUGHTER OF POISONED SPY SERGEI SKRIPAL TURNS DOWN RUSSIAN HELP

Skripal was arrested in 2004 in Moscow and later confessed to having been recruited by British intelligence in 1995. He also said at the time that he provided information about GRU agents in Europe, receiving over $100,000 in return.

In 2006, Skripal was convicted on charges of spying for Britain and sentenced to 13 years. However, he later was pardoned and released from custody in July 2010 as part of a U.S.-Russian spy swap, which followed the exposure of a ring of Russian sleeper agents in the U.S.

He had been living quietly in the cathedral city of Salisbury, 90 miles southwest of London, when he was struck down.

Britain blamed Russia for the attack while Moscow denied all allegations. In response, more than two dozen Western allies, including the U.S., ordered out over 150 Russian diplomats in a show of solidarity. In response, Russia ordered out 60 U.S. diplomats and closed the consulate in St. Petersburg in a tit-for-tat response.

"The co-founder of international nudist, anti-Putin group Femen was found dead Monday in her Paris apartment, the group said.

Oksana Shachko, the 31-year-old co-founder of the feminist protest movement, was found with a suicide note beside her, the Guardian reported.

“It is with great regret and deep pain that I must confirm the death of Oksana,” Inna Shevchenko, who also lives in the French capital, told the newspaper.

Another of the group’s founder, Anna Gutsol, confirmed the death on Facebook, saying the members were awaiting “the official version from the police.”

“RIP. The most fearless and vulnerable Oksana Shachko has left us,” Gutsol wrote. “We mourn together with her relatives and friends.”

The Guardian reported Shachko was one of the four activists who founded Femen in Ukraine in 2008. She was exiled to France in 2013.

Femen, operating under the slogan “I came, I stripped, I won,” sought to challenge authoritarianism and racism. Russian leader Vladimir Putin was their usual target.

In 2011, three members of the group – including Shachko – were “kidnapped” by security agents and forced to strip naked in a forest after Femen mocked the Belarusian president in a protest.

"Angela Merkel’s government is on the brink as the German chancellor battles her coalition partners on immigration and asylum seekers.

The coalition between Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) has fractured over the latter’s new proposed policy that would turn away more asylum seekers at the country’s borders.

The policy flies in the face of the most powerful woman in the world and de factor leader of the European Union. In 2015, her 'open door' policy to migrants saw approximately a million refugees flood into the country. Although migrant arrivals have dropped steeply in the past two years, Germany still registered around 11,000 new asylum-seekers each month.

Her decision is believed to be a major contributing factor to the surge in support for the far-Right and anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD), which became the third-largest party in Germany after the 2017 federal election when it won 94 seats in the Bundestag.

MERKEL, MACRON FACE MIGRANT CRISIS AS EUROPE'S NATIONALIST-POPULIST MOVEMENT CHALKS UP WINS

Horst Seehofer, the CSU interior minister, whose party is facing regional elections in October, wants Germany to turn back refugees who have already registered in other European countries. He also wants to block migrants whose asylum applications in Germany have already been rejected from returning.

Merkel fears such a move could increase the burden on countries include Italy, Greece and Spain, believing it could potentially fracture the European Union even further.

While she wants to see a bilateral agreement at a EU summit and the end of June, the CSU has set her an effective ultimatum of next Monday.

“Personally, I think that illegal migration is one of the challenges for the European Union and therefore I believe that we shouldn’t act unilaterally, that we shouldn’t act without coordination and that we shouldn’t act in a way that burdens third parties, involved,” Merkel said.

Wolfgang Schaueble, the former finance minister and current parliamentary president who is respected on both sides, has been asked to mediate negotiations between the CDU and CSU.

GERMANY: MERKEL PLEDGES THAT 2015 MIGRANT INFLUX WON'T RECUR

“We are in a serious, a very serious situation,” said Alexander Dobrindt, the CSU parliamentary group leader.

A poll published on Thursday by German broadcaster ARD found that 62 per cent of its citizens believe refugees without papers should not be allowed in.

The CSU fears that anti-immigration sentiment in the country could bring an end to its decades-old stranglehold on Bavaria’s government. They face crucial regional elections in October.

The coalition’s center-left ally, the Social Democrat Party (SPD), has demanded that the dispute be settled.

Andrea Nahles, the leader of the SDP, accused Markus Soeder, the governor of Bavaria, and Seehofer of “taking all of Germany and Europe hostage”.

She added that Soeder was acting like a “bonsai Trump”.

Olaf Scholz, the SPF finance minister, said: “The task of governing our country is not an episode of Game of Thrones, but a very serious matter. Those involved should not forget that.”

Adding to tensions, a Twitter hoax made Germans think the government had already collapsed. An account claiming to be Hessicher Rundfunk state broadcaster claimed Seehofer had dissolved the alliance, but minutes later it was confirmed to be fake.

Germany has seen more than one million asylum seekers arrive since 2015 since Merkel introduced her open door policy, but she has even acknowledged the need to strengthen the EU’s external borders.

GERMANY'S MERKEL SET FOR 4TH TERM AFTER SOCIAL DEMOCRATS OK COALITION

Of the Asian games at the Asian Games, sepaktakraw should get some billing as a festival event.

With origins in rural southeast Asian provinces — several countries lay claim to creating it — sepaktakraw is like an aerial soccer or hands-free volleyball where players can use their feet, knees, heads, elbows or shoulders to propel a woven, synthetic ball. No hands.

That name of the game is a literal translation. Proponents explain that it's a combination of languages with ""sepak"" coming from the term used for kick in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, and ""takraw"" being the Thai word for the woven ball.

While the acrobatic, overhead kicks and athletic, somersaulting leaps to the height of the net are eye-catching, the sport's place on the Asian Games program is far from secure.

At the 2018 Games being co-hosted in Jakarta and Palembang, only eleven countries entered the team regu — or team of teams — competition.

With the next Asian Games travelling to China, there has been speculation sepaktakraw will be cut from the program.

Understandably, that notion has not been well received in Thailand, winner of the first three gold medals in this tournament.

""This is one of the sports that really shows the athleticism and it is really exciting to watch,"" Sakha Siriwat, gold-medal winner in the team regu, said. ""It is very thrilling and also it's a sport with such a long heritage, so it should not be dropped.

""It's a very exciting sport to watch.""

Thailand coach Kamol Tankimhong sounded confident sepaktakraw would be retained for the continental Olympic-style games, which attract more than 11,000 athletes in 40 sports.

""We have great confidence in the international federation, and the Asian federation — they are working hard so that we raise the awareness of the sport,"" Tankimhong said.

Sepaktakraw is played by groups of two or three who try to score points by hitting the takraw above the net and into the court about the size of a badminton space as the opposing players attempt to block.

The atmosphere was electric as Thailand beat arch rivals Malaysia in the opening men's team regu, a rivalry that has lasted decades.

Malaysia swept all the gold medals in 1990 and 1994 but Thailand has dominated the event ever since.

After the Thai men won the team regu here, Thailand's women beat South Korea for gold in the team event. Vietnam and Myanmar took bronze.

On Saturday, Thailand won the men's team doubles over Laos, while Indonesia and Japan picked up bronze medals.

There are three more finals on the program.

The Singapore-based International Sepaktakraw Federation has members from 31 national associations and oversees all disciplines, including the game adapted to the beach.

""Wherever it has taken root, Sepaktakraw enjoys cult status,"" the ISTAF says on its website. ""Southeast Asia may be the birthplace of the sport and the stage for its greatest champions, but an enormous variety of regional tournaments and domestic events have sprung up around the globe.

""From the Sepaktakraw Swiss Open and the Chicken's Cup in Germany ... the proliferation of competition has grown the talent pool substantially.""

Siriwat, who has won gold medals at three Asian Games, is hopeful the performances in Palembang help the sport keep its place on the program.

""It will be a sad occasion if it is not in the Asian Games anymore,"" he said. ""I would feel sad for the younger generation. I won't be able to show the world how Takraw is played or how it is supposed to be played.""",world
"United States U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters that President Trump’s “deal of the century” in solving the Israeli-Palestinian situation can happen but only if Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas agrees to it. Haley was speaking to reporters at a press conference marking the United States presidency of this month’s U.N. Security Council.

Haley in response to a question if the deal of the century was attainable said, “Only if Abbas comes to the table. We have ensured that (Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin) Netanyahu will come to the table. Abbas, for the good of his people, needs to come to the table.” The Palestinian leadership cut off all contacts with the Trump administration when the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December.

While many critics of the Trump administration have claimed there is no peace plan, Haley said she had read it, but told reporters that it would not be rolled out during this month’s United Nations General Assembly debate when Trump and other world leaders will address the global body.

“I can tell you that (White House senior adviser) Jared Kushner and (Trump’s special envoy for international negotiations) Jason Greenblatt have done unbelievably detailed work in it. I have read the plan. It is thoroughly done. It is well-thought-out from both sides, the Palestinians and the Israelis.”

She continued, “The president’s full intent is to completely do everything he can with the peace plan.”

Haley, who has made defending close U.S. ally Israel a top priority at the U.N., told reporters that Abbas must do more to help the Palestinian people.

“I will tell you again, for the good of the Palestinian people, the region, the international community, we have to put pressure on Abbas, and say, it’s time. It’s time for a better life for Palestinians. And only he can deliver that. And we have to acknowledge that Hamas is part of the problem.”

As for United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the agency that the Trump administration cut all funding to last Friday, Haley criticized it for being a political organization.

She said the U.S. up until last year had given had given $6 billion to the Palestinians.

“UNRWA is a political arm that claims to serve Palestinians. We have, for two years, asked UNRWA to reform itself because it has this ongoing number of refugees that is unsustainable. We can’t sustain — and the world knows. Everybody knows it. Every year, they come and say the schools aren’t going to open. But they keep adding numbers of refugees to where we’re never going to be able to sustain that.”

Haley noted that the U.S. was not cutting aid to the Palestinians — just UNRWA. She called upon other countries in the region to put their money where their mouth is.

“Don’t blame us for cutting aid. Don’t blame us for saying that we think UNRWA is political, and that it needs to be reformed. If you think it’s fine, go: you pay for it. But don’t blame the United States for a faulty political organization that I don’t think is doing justice to the people of the Palestinian community.”

Haley also outlined the U.S. plans for its Security Council presidency for the month of September. That includes Trump chairing a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Iran. The meeting will address Iran’s continued violations of international law, and the Islamic regime’s meddling throughout the Middle East. Haley said she would not oppose Iranian President Hassan Rouhani attending the meeting.

Asked whether the Trump administration had a strategy for Iran, and if that included regime change, Haley told reporters that the administration’s strategy was very simple.

Haley said that, “We’re going to stand with the Iranian people. This is not about a regime change, and who’s the next leader. This is everything about standing with the Iranian people, and say they have every right to be heard in their government, and they have every right to change it if it’s not being led the right way. And we’re going to continue to expose all the violations that Iran does. And we think the international community should join us with that because it is an issue for the future and it is a future — an issue that affects every country in the world.”

Trump also will preside over a meeting to counter narcotics. Haley said the issue is very important to him, and is a topic that has hit nearly all countries in the world. At that meeting, the president will issue a global call to action to the world leaders assembled in New York.",world

"Rescuers in Thailand on Monday freed four more members of the boys soccer team stranded in a flooded cave complex, as part of the second phase of a desperate rescue operation that aims to save four more kids and the team's coach before heavy rains imperil the effort.

Four ambulances with flashing lights were spotted leaving the area as Thai navy SEALs said on Facebook that four boys were brought out of the cave on Monday, bringing the total to eight rescued so far before rescue operations were suspended for the day.

Chiang Rai acting Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said at a news conference the rescue mission on Monday took only 9 hours compared to the 11 hours the previous day, adding that rescue crews are more familiar with the mission and additional help was present. A Thai army deputy commander added that the operation went ""smoothly"" but warned the next phase ""will depend on all conditions,"" according to Sky News.

Narongsak said that rescuers, which included 18 divers and 100 personnel, may need to adjust their operation if they choose to bring out the remaining five people on Tuesday, and that it may take multiple steps.

Thai officials stressed they are hoping the rescue operation will be wrapped up by Tuesday, and that the four who were first pulled out of the cave on Sunday are eating solid food now and in ""good condition.""

The newest set of rescues came about six hours after Chiang Rai acting Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said the second phase was underway. One helicopter carried the sixth and seventh boys to be rescued to a hospital, while the eighth boy was being transported on another helicopter for medical treatment.

""All conditions are still as good as they were yesterday,"" Narongsak told a news conference. ""The boys' strength, the plan — today we are ready like before. And we will do it faster because we are afraid of the rain.""

On Sunday, Thai navy SEALs successfully retrieved the first four members of the youth soccer team from the cave where they had been trapped for more than two weeks in the first rescue operation.

Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda said early Monday the same group of expert divers who took part in Sunday's rescue returned to extricate the others because they know the cave conditions and what to do. He said fresh air tanks needed to be laid along the underwater route, as officials continue to pump water out of the cave.

'DON'T BLAME YOURSELF,' PARENT OF TRAPPED THAI YOUTH WRITES TO BOYS' COACH

Reuters, citing an unnamed source at a nearby hospital, reported the boys’ conditions were “not bad” but will continue to be monitored.

""This morning they said they were hungry and wanted to eat khao pad grapao,"" Narongsak said, according to the Associated Press, referring to a Thai dish of meat fried with chili and basil and served over rice.

It was not immediately clear Monday how the overnight rains had impacted water levels inside the flooded cave. Officials have said storms forecast for Chiang Rai province in Thailand's far north had factored into their decision to go ahead with a complicated and dangerous plan to have the boys and their coach dive out of the cave. If everything goes to according to plan, the operation should be completed on Tuesday, officials previously told The Wall Street Journal.

DR. MARC SIEGEL: BOYS RESCUED FROM THAI CAVE NOW FACE POSSIBLE MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

Narongsak previously said experts told him flooding from new rain could shrink the unflooded space where the boys are sheltering to just 108 square feet.

""I confirm that we are at war with water and time from the first day up to today,"" he said. ""Finding the boys doesn't mean we've finished our mission. It is only a small battle we've won, but the war has not ended. The war ends when we win all three battles — the battles to search, rescue and send them home.""

The death Friday of a former Thai navy SEAL underscored the risks. The diver, the first fatality of the rescue effort, was working in a volunteer capacity and died on a mission to place air canisters along the passage to where the boys are, a necessary task in order for divers to safely travel the five- to six-hour route.

4 BOYS FROM THAI SOCCER TEAM RESCUED FROM FLOODED CAVE

Authorities spent hours replenishing air tanks along the cave's treacherous exit route.

Trips from the entrance to where the team is trapped and back to the entrance take about 11 hours and include walking, wading, climbing and diving, the BBC reported. There is reportedly a guide rope in place. Two divers will accompany each boy as they are gradually extracted.

An international team of expert divers—90 in all, 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas—have been working in the area.

About 40 U.S. Air Force special operations personnel -- including an 18-person personnel recovery team -- were on the ground in Thailand at two locations, a U.S. defense official told Fox News.

The stranded boys, members of the Wild Boars soccer team, have been invited to the World Cup Final in Moscow if they make it out in time and can physically handle the trip.

"A Canadian man’s body was discovered by his mother and a friend more than three weeks after the 32-year-old school teacher vanished while hiking in the Bavarian Alps, his family said on Sunday.

The body of Jeff Freiheit, 32, was located Saturday in a wooded area near the Brauneck mountain south of Munich, his family told CBC. Freiheit’s sister Amanda Devigne said her mother and a friend, who flew to Germany to join the search for the school teacher, discovered the body. Freiheit’s wife also confirmed the news on her Facebook page.

“It is with overwhelming grief and sadness that I share with you that Jeff was found and is no longer with us. Through a broken heart I’ve found peace in knowing that he did not suffer. Our family is beyond grateful for the outpouring of support during this sad and difficult time,” she wrote on Facebook Sunday.

A backpack with his passport was also located. Police believe the man fell between 197 and 328 feet while hiking and said there was no evidence of foul play.

Freiheit, from Manitoba, Canada, went missing on Aug. 2, just three days after he set off on his month-long trip traveling through Munich, Germany to Venice, Italy. The avid hiker last spoke to his wife on FaceTime on Aug. 1 and was active on Instagram the next day until he reached the top of the mountain, Global News reported.

“Day three, it’s been a good morning so far…just to give you an idea of what the next three hours entails, here we go,” Freiheit posted on Instagram hours before his communication cut off.

Freiheit’s friend Chris Kennedy previously told Global News that Freiheit had planned his trip for months.

“He was training for this before he left, doing 30 kilometers [18 miles] a day hikes,” Kennedy said. “He’s a great athlete, a university basketball player. No one was worried because we knew he could do this.”

“He had a strict itinerary, so it’s a big concern because he had the whole month planned. There is no rational reason why he would go off that plan,” he added.",world
"At least seven people have been confirmed dead and more than 30 people were unaccounted for after a magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck Japan's northernmost main island early Thursday.

The quake rocked southern Hokkaido at 3:08 a.m. local time, Japan's Meteorological Agency said. The tremor triggered landslides that crushed homes and forced a nuclear power plant onto a backup generator after it was damaged.

The agency said the quake did not pose a tsunami risk.

The epicenter was east of the city of Tomakomai. The powerful shaking damaged homes and cleaved apart roads in the prefectural capital of Sapporo, with a population of 1.9 million.

In the nearby town of Atsuma, dozens of residents were reported missing after a massive landslide consumed homes beneath a sea of soil, rocks and timber.

Reconstruction Minister Jiro Akama told reporters that five people were believed to be buried in the town's Yoshino district. Some of the 40 people stranded there were airlifted to safer grounds, NHK said.

More than 290 citizens were reported injured. As rescuers desperately searched for survivors beneath the landslides, the death toll was expected to rise.

Reuters reported that the latest natural disaster to strike Japan knocked out power to all 5.3 million of Hokkaido’s residents.

Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters that the extensive power outage was caused by an emergency shutdown of the main thermal power plant at Tomato Atsuma that supplies half of Hokkaido's electricity.

Seko said utilities were planning to start up several other thermal and hydroelectric plants to provide at least some power. However, full power could take more than a week to be restored, he said.

In the meantime, authorities sent power-generator vehicles to hospitals so enable them to treat emergency patients, he said.

The BBC reported that residents wrote on social media of long lines at food stores as they prepare for aftershocks.

""Only a few cartons of instant ramen were left,"" said Mika Takeda, who lives in the town of Bei. The one local gas station was limiting customers to only 20 liters (5 gallons) of gas, she said.

Tensions over China and refugees ran high Tuesday at a meeting of Pacific leaders after host Nauru accused a Chinese official of bullying and temporarily detained a New Zealand journalist.

Nauru is hosting the Pacific Islands Forum, which is being attended this week by leaders from 18 member nations and delegations from other countries including the U.S. and China.

Nauru recognizes Taiwan and doesn't have diplomatic relations with China.

After a closed-door meeting at the forum on Tuesday, Nauru President Baron Waqa said a Chinese official had demanded to be heard when other leaders were due to speak.

""And he insisted, and was very insolent about it, and created a big fuss and held up the meeting of leaders for a good number of minutes when he was only an official,"" Waqa said. ""Maybe because he was from a big country he wanted to bully us.""

Even before the forum started there had been tensions with China after some other nations threatened to pull out following a dispute over whether Chinese officials could use their diplomatic passports to enter Nauru. Waqa said it had all been a misunderstanding, and that officials from both countries often traveled to the other country using ordinary passports.

Nauru has been eager to limit discussion during the forum of the more than 600 refugees who live on the tiny island, and has placed restrictions on visiting journalists reporting on topics outside the forum.

Nauru police detained 1 News journalist Barbara Dreaver for about three hours and revoked her forum accreditation after she was spotted interviewing a refugee outside a local restaurant.

Dreaver said she was just doing her job.

""I was under the impression, and I know, we were allowed to talk to refugees,"" Dreaver said. ""I think it probably shows things are a wee bit sensitive here, in fact a lot sensitive.""

Waqa disputed whether Dreaver was detained, saying she'd been taken to the police station for questioning and had cooperated. He said she breached protocols by not asking permission to speak to refugees in the high-tension environment.

""The media coming are not interested in the Pacific, but interested in something else,"" Waqa said. ""We knew this all along, and it's sad.""

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement that she was pleased that Dreaver had been released.

""This government believes in freedom of the press, throughout the world, and of course that includes the entire Pacific region,"" Ardern said.

Ardern is due to join the forum for its final day on Wednesday. She has faced some criticism at home for the extra cost to taxpayers of flying her to Nauru separately after the rest of her delegation had arrived so she wouldn't have to be away as long from her infant daughter Neve.",world
"In a landmark ruling, India’s top court has struck down a colonial-era law that prohibits homosexual acts.

The vote among the five-judge bench was unanimous, Reuters reported.

“Any consensual sexual relationship between two consenting adults - homosexuals, heterosexuals or lesbians - cannot be said to be unconstitutional,” Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra, said Thursday as he read the judgment, according to the news agency.

Five citizens had challenged the law, saying they were living in fear of being harassed and prosecuted by police. The court issued its ruling Thursday.

The existing law had made homosexual acts punishable by up to 10 years in prison. It was reinstated in 2013 after four years of decriminalization, Reuters reported.

Gay rights activists welcomed the ruling.

“Thanks to all that fought for this, braving the worst sort of prejudice. This is a good day for human rights,” Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for Human Rights Watch, wrote on Twitter.

In 2009, a New Delhi High Court declared unconstitutional Section 377 of the law, which said same-sex intercourse was against the order of nature. But the Supreme Court overturned that ruling, saying it should be up to Parliament to amend or repeal the law.

But the government left it to the court to decide the validity of the law dealing with consensual sexual acts between two adults.

"The newly elected mayor of London's call for a ban on public ads that show scantily clad women has critics complaining the move has more to do with his Muslim roots than his concerns about ""body-shaming.""

@MayorofLondon @TfL so does that mean all ads for weight loss products will be banned because they might upset some fat people? — Charmaine Saunders (@Mainie59) June 13, 2016

Sadiq Khan, who became the city's first Muslim mayor in May, called for a ban on ads showing women in bikinis in a letter published in the Guardian, saying images such as the controversial ""Beach Body Ready"" one used by Protein World send a harmful message.

""As the father of two teenage girls, I am extremely concerned about this kind of advertising which can demean people, particularly women, and make them ashamed of their bodies,"" Khan wrote. ""It is high time it came to an end.""

The city's mass transit system, Transport for London, will create an ""Advertising Steering Group"" in conjunction with the advertising companies to ensure that on buses and subways ""reflect London's diversity,"" according to the mayor's office.

The move is not sitting well with critics who believe it is an accommodation to Muslim sensibilities. In strict Islamic society, women are supposed to dress ""modestly,"" which can mean anything from a head scarf to a full burka with only eye slits.

Demonstrators marched through Mexico City on Thursday to protest a $15.7-billion airport project that threatens a decades-old effort to restore the lakes that originally covered the valley in which the capital and nearby cities are located.

Carrying banners reading ""The earth is not for sale!"" a couple of hundred demonstrators followed Ignacio del Valle, a leader from the town of Atenco who has fought plans for a new airport east of the capital since 2001.

""This is the murder of the environment, because the environmental impact has not been measured or recognized,"" said Del Valle.

Farmers from Atenco and other communities close to the new Mexico City airport — which is about one-third completed — say they were never consulted. They claim the farms and shallow bodies of water in the area provide flood-regulation and fresh air for the metropolis of 20 million.

Former environment secretary Jose Luis Luege said the government is already draining Lake Nabor Carrillo, a shallow 2,265 acres (917 hectare) lake that provides a major habitat for migratory birds.

The new airport — whose construction began in 2016 and was designed in collaboration with celebrated architect Norman Foster — is being built right next to the lake.

Concentrated bird populations are dangerous next to airports because the birds can fly into jet engines. So Lake Nabor Carillo has to go.

Mexico City was founded in 1315 on an island in a lake, which was steadily drained following the 1521 Spanish conquest.

But the dried-out lakebed proved an environmental nightmare, with particles of dust and dried sewage causing dust storms in the city during the dry season. It also flooded periodically in rainy season, something that may happen again to the new airport.

Lake Nabor Carrillo was established in 1982 to replicate a small portion of the old Lake Texcoco, whose final portions were drained by the early 1900s.

Nabor Carrillo absorbed rainwaters and prevented dust storms, part of a larger 1970s reclamation plan known as The Lake Texcoco Project.

""This airport project ends forever the Lake Texcoco Plan,"" Luege said. ""That is something that, from an environmental point of view, is unforgiveable.""

The government has given contradictory answers as to whether any lakes can be left around the new airport. The government water agency said some portion of Nabor Carrillo would remain, but only certain bird species less prone to interfering with jets would be allowed; it didn't explain how authorities could exclude some birds but not others.

The agency in charge of building the airport has suggested birds would be encouraged to find other lakes in the Mexico valley; however, as Luege points out, those lakes are highly polluted, many with raw sewage.

President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has long opposed the airport project, saying it is too costly.

But walking away from it now would imply losing about $5 billion already committed to the project.

Since his July 1 election victory, Lopez Obrador has backed off threats to simply abandon the project, saying instead he would submit the decision to a public referendum, offering the choice of possibly farming out the needed investment to private companies in a concessionary scheme.

Lopez Obrador has also said that an alternative airport could be built at a nearby military base, but aeronautic experts say that would still be too close to the current, over-crowded 1940s-era Benito Juarez International Airport for both to operate simultaneously.

Critics say the government was not honest about the immense impacts the projects would have. Many critical issues were not seriously contemplated in environmental impact statements on the project dating back to 2014, they say.

""The airport is a real reflection of one of the worst problems we have in Mexico, which is the imperial presidency,"" said Luege. ""It is the president's project, so what does that mean? It has to be approved at any cost.""",world

The attack on a kosher restaurant in Chemnitz by masked neo-Nazis on the sidelines of an anti-migrant protest shows there's a deep problem with right-wing extremism in the region and should be treated as a call to action, the head of Germany's Central Council of Jews said Sunday.

Josef Schuster, who had previously condemned the violent far-right protests on Aug. 26 and 27 before the attack on the Jewish restaurant was even known, said ""we need to call the problem by its name.""

""The racist riots and the attack on the kosher restaurant in Chemnitz show how strongly rooted right-wing extremism is in the region,"" he said.

Hundreds of protesters took to the streets after a German man was stabbed and killed Aug. 26 after authorities say a verbal argument with migrant men escalated. An Iraqi and a Syrian have been arrested on manslaughter charges. That day several foreigners were injured after authorities said they were attacked in the streets.

The next night, around 6,000 far-right protesters including neo-Nazis, members of the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany party and others clashed with counter-demonstrators. On the sidelines, masked protesters attacked the Shalom restaurant with rocks and bottles, injuring the owner while shouting ""Jewish pig, get out of Germany.""

The unrest following the killing has focused new attention on Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision three years ago to allow hundreds of thousands of refugees into the country, straining its resources and hospitality beyond what some Germans considered acceptable.

Anti-migrant sentiment has been particularly strong in Saxony, the state where Chemnitz is located. The nearby state capital of Dresden is home to the group Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, or PEGIDA, and the Alternative for Germany received almost a quarter of the vote in Saxony last year.

The protests have also exposed a rift between Merkel and top security officials. Her domestic spy chief last week openly questioned her spokesman's statement that foreigners were ""hunted"" in the streets by the angry mob, saying he'd seen no credible evidence of it, and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer on Thursday expressed sympathy for the protesters.

""If I were not a minister, I'd have gone to the streets as a citizen,"" Seehofer said, quickly adding: ""Naturally, not together with the radicals.""

Schuster slammed the officials, without identifying any by name, saying that efforts to ""obviously minimize the incidents make me seriously doubt the work of these authorities.""

""Attempts at appeasement and a lack of distancing from the right-populists play exactly into the hands of these forces,"" he said.

Saxony state Interior Minister Roland Woeller met Saturday with the owner of the Jewish restaurant, and assured him police were working intensively to ""solve this abhorrent crime,"" the dpa news agency reported.

Police last week said they'd already identified six far-right protesters who gave the stiff-armed Hitler salute or committed other violations of Germany's statute banning the display of Nazi symbols during the protests. They said they were reviewing video evidence in dozens of other cases.

In an unrelated incident in the neighboring state of Saxony-Anhalt, police said Sunday they had arrested two Afghan men in the city of Koethen on suspicion of murder in the killing of a 22-year-old German man.

"The American woman who was held captive with her husband by a Taliban-linked militant group claims her husband routinely physically and emotionally abused her while they were in captivity.

In new documents unsealed this week, Caitlan Coleman, 32, alleges that her husband Joshua Boyle regularly threatened to kill her by setting her on fire during their five-year ordeal as hostages by the Haqqani network.

The Ottawa Citizen reported that Coleman is seeking to gain sole custody of their three children – who were all born in captivity.

Coleman claims that throughout their time as hostages, her husband became increasingly erratic and irrational, “depicting me as an enemy of his life.”

“[He] had uncontrolled rage, instituted corporal punishment of me, and struck me in a fit of rage,” she said.

Coleman also accused her husband of having extremist ideologies that included “the complete subservience of women.” As evidence, she cited his previous marriage to Zaynab Khadr, the eldest daughter of Ahmed Said Khadr, a member of Usama bin Laden’s inner circle.

In his own 23-page affidavit, Boyle, a native of Canada, denied the allegations of abuse against him and instead accused her of neglecting their children because of mental health issues.

"Hungary’s populist government is stopping universities from offering courses in gender studies, saying there is no need for graduates in the labor market and they take taxpayer money away from other programs.



The move, announced this week, comes after Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government won a comfortable majority in April after an election focused primarily on immigration. Since then his Fidesz Party has been implementing key parts of its election manifesto.



In a statement, Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said that there is “no demonstrable demand for graduates of ‘social gender studies’ in the Hungarian labor market.

“There is no economic rationale for studies such as these, and so we have reason to presume that it was not created in response to labor market needs, and equally not to furnish students with skills that can be readily and directly converted on the labor market,” he said. It is also questionable to what extent studies with admittedly such low student numbers are economical and sustainable.”



Hungary’s HVG said that it would only affect two of the country’s universities, but also that such courses had been in the government’s crosshairs for a while.



Critics of the nationalist government say that Orban has been engaging in authoritarian tactics and this move is likely only to fuel such claims.



But Kovacs, the government spokesman, said that such programs “take valuable resources away from other programs, and deteriorate the economic stability of universities.”



“State universities operated from public funds must take this into consideration as the purpose of these higher education institutions is to meet genuine social and labour market needs,” he said.



Earlier this year, his government implemented a “Stop Soros” package aimed at Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros.

The package includes a law that makes it illegal for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to organize illegal immigration into the country. Such activities can range from financial support to the distribution and preparation of information and pamphlets.

"A mountain in North Korea believed to have served as the site of five of the rogue regime’s nuclear tests -- including Sunday’s supposed hydrogen bomb explosion -- is at risk of collapsing and leaking radiation into the region, a Chinese scientist said Monday.

Researchers at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, Anhui province, examined the Punggye-ri site and said they “were confident” underground detonations were occurring underneath the mountain, South China Morning Post reported.

Wang Naiyan, a former chairman of the China Nuclear Society and a researcher on China's own nuclear weapons program, said another test underneath the mountain can cause an “environmental disaster” if the site caves in on itself, allowing radiation to escape and “drift across the region,” including into China.

“We call it ‘taking the roof off.’ If the mountain collapses and the hole is exposed, it will let out many bad things.” Wang told the South China Morning Post.

NORTH KOREA WARNS MORE 'GIFT PACKAGES' TO US AS EUROPE WORRIES ABOUT MISSILE STRIKE

Wang said there are limited mountains in North Korea that are “suitable” to conduct a nuclear test and vertical tunnels could reduce the likelihood of the “top” of the mountain being blown off. However, horizontal tunnels are easier to build – but more likely to cause the mountain to implode with a bigger blast.

North Korea claimed it detonated a hydrogen bomb over the weekend, calling the test a “perfect success.” The test triggered an artificial magnitude 6.3 earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. A second tremor was detected minutes after the first, described as a cave-in or collapse by USGS and China’s earthquake administration.

The test was estimated to have a yield of 100 kilotons, meaning a blast that was four to five times more powerful than the explosion in Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945, a South Korean defense official told the country's Yonhap News Agency. The precise strength of the underground nuclear explosion has yet to be determined and experts are still working to confirm the nuclear device was in fact a hydrogen bomb.

KIM JONG UN’S NORTH KOREA: BRINGING THE WORLD TO THE BRINK

Despite Wang’s warning about radiation, readings conducted after the test on Sunday showed no change in the air sample near China’s border with North Korea, the South China Morning Post reported.

The regime’s nuclear and missile program has made huge strides since Kim Jong Un took power in 2011 after his father’s death. It conducted its first intercontinental ballistic missile test in July following a series of missile launches earlier this year.

North Korea is thought to have a growing arsenal of nuclear bombs and has spent decades trying to perfect a multistage, long-range missile to eventually carry smaller versions of those bombs.

A look at recent developments in the South China Sea, where China is pitted against smaller neighbors in multiple disputes over islands, coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves:

EDITOR'S NOTE: This is a weekly look at the latest developments in the South China Sea, the location of several territorial conflicts that have raised tensions in the region.

JAPANESE, US NAVIES JOIN IN TRAINING

The Japanese navy's largest ship has joined up with the USS Ronald Regan aircraft carrier strike group for joint exercises in the South China Sea, the latest sign of Japan's increased presence in the region on which it depends for much of its foreign trade.

Joined by two guided missile destroyers, the helicopter carrier JS Kaga is on a southern cruise that includes port calls in India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines.

The Japan Times newspaper said Friday's exercise included sailing in formation, maneuvering procedures, replenishment-at-sea and the exchange of liaison officers. The almost 20,000-ton Kaga can carry up to 28 aircraft and has a crew of 400.

China has repeatedly denounced Japanese military activity in the seaway it claims as its own territory, particularly when that includes joint maneuvers with the U.S. and other countries considered outside interlopers by Beijing. China's defense ministry last week accused Japan of seeking excuses to justify amending its pacifist constitution and return to its ""old past of expansionism.""

Despite such protests, the government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has responded to China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea by boosting its own presence there. That was underscored by the dispatch of the helicopter carrier JS Izumo to the region for a three-month tour last year, described by Japanese media as the navy's largest show of force in the South China Sea since World War II.

An estimated $5 trillion in global trade traverses the South China Sea annually, much of it traveling to or from Japan.

PHILIPPINE NAVY FRIGATE RUNS AGROUND

Philippine officials say they notified China about a navy frigate that ran aground near a hotly disputed area of the South China Sea in hopes of avoiding any misunderstandings.

The Philippine military said the BRP Gregorio del Pilar ran aground during a routine patrol Wednesday night in the vicinity of Half Moon Shoal, called Hasa Hasa in the Philippines. The crew was unhurt.

The barren shoal is on the eastern edge of the disputed Spratly archipelago, where tensions have run high in recent years after China transformed seven disputed reefs into islands, including three with runways, and reportedly installed missile defense system.

Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said China offered to help free the ship but the Philippines declined because it was able to handle the matter on its own.

The Philippines earlier was one of the most vocal critics of China's assertive moves in the disputed waters. In 2016 it largely won a complaint it lodged before an international tribunal that invalidated Beijing's sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, however, took steps to revive once-frosty ties with China after he took office in 2016 as he sought infrastructure funding and more trade and investment from Beijing.

The frigate is one of three former U.S. Coast Guard cutters acquired by the Philippine military from the United States that now are the Philippines' largest warships.

CHINA RESPONDS TO US B-52 FLIGHTS

China's defense ministry said it scrambled jet fighters and took other measures in response to operations by U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers in the vicinity of the South China Sea.

Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Wu Qian said Thursday that the U.S. planes entered China's self-declared East China Sea air defense identification zone on Aug. 23. He said Chinese planes were dispatched for surveillance purposes and that other unspecified actions were taken.

The U.S. Pacific Air Forces said two U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bombers departed from Anderson Air Force Base in Guam and participated ""in routine training missions"" on Aug. 27 and 30. It wasn't clear whether those were the same missions Wu was referring to.

The statement said the bombers assigned to the 96th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron ""conducted training in the vicinity of the South China Sea before returning to Guam."" It said they also integrated with the strike group attached to the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan.

""U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's Continuous Bomber Presence (CBP) operations have been ongoing since March 2004; these recent missions are consistent with international law and United States' long-standing and well-known freedom of navigation policies,"" the statement said.

""CBP operations demonstrate the United States' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, help maintain the readiness of U.S. forces and improve coalition and joint service interoperability,"" it said.

"Officials investigating a ""ghost ship"" found mysteriously drifting off the coast of Burma this week solved the mystery of where the vessel came from on Friday.

The rusty Sam Rataulangi PB 1600 freighter was discovered by fishermen in the Gulf of Maraban, about 7 miles off the coast near Yangon, the largest city in Burma, which is called Myanmar by its ruling junta.

The country's navy said the empty cargo ship was being towed to a ship-breaking plant in Bangladesh when severe weather caused it to become detached sometime early last week, according to Sky News.

Yangon Police said on their Facebook page the ship was ""stranded on the beach (and was) bearing an Indonesian flag,"" police said, adding that there were ""no sailors or goods"" onboard.

Navy officials had used coastal radar records to establish the location of two vessels prior to their separation, and then tracked down a tugboat called Independence about 50 miles off the coast.

When crew members were questioned, they told the Navy they had left Jakarta on Aug. 13 for the ship-breaking factory in Bangladesh.

""They faced bad weather when they arrived south of Yangon River,"" the navy said, according to Agence France-Presse. ""The cables attached to the ship broke, and the ship was floating along with the tide and it was difficult to continue its journey.""

The vessel then ran aground after being carried off by the current, before it was found by fishermen this week.

The Sam Rataulangi was built in 2001 and has a dead weight of 26,500 tons, according to the Marine Traffic, which lists the movements of ships around the globe. The ship's last reported location was off the coast on Taiwan in 2009.",world
"The leader of the Russia-backed separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region was killed Friday by an explosion at a cafe, the separatists' news agency said Friday.

Rebel news agency DAN said the afternoon explosion killed Alexander Zakharchenko, 42, the prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic. The separatist government's revenue minister, Alexander Timofeev, was severely injured in the blast, Russian news agencies reported.

The Donetsk People's Republic, along with a separatist republic in neighboring Luhansk, has fought Ukrainian forces since 2014, the same year Zakharchenko became prime minister of DPR's secessionist government. More than 10,000 people have died in the conflict.

CLERIC: ‘NO GOING BACK’ ON UKRAINE SPLIT FROM RUSSIA CHURCH

The cafe in the city of Donetsk that was hit by the explosion, named Separ, was separatist-themed and had camouflage netting hanging from its eaves, according to recent photographs.

It was not immediately clear if a bomb caused the blast or it resulted from something else. Russia's Interfax news agency cited local sources as saying suspects had been detained, but there was no official confirmation.

Denis Pushilin, the speaker of the separatists' parliament, blamed Ukrainian forces for the explosion, calling it ""the latest aggression from the Ukrainian side,"" according to DAN.

ISRAEL READIES FOR UPCOMING VISIT OF PHILIPPINES PRESIDENT



The rebellion in Donetsk and Luhansk arose soon after pro-Russia Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was driven from power amid mass protests in February 2014. Russian-speakers predominate in the two regions, and separatist sentiment skyrocketed.

Encouraged by Russia's annexation of Crimea, which also came after Yanukovych's ouster, rebel leaders initially hoped their regions would be absorbed by Russia as well.",world
"A retired American couple was found fatally shot inside their Mexico home after a botched robbery Saturday, authorities said.

Jo Anne Butler, 69, and Ray Ball, 72, of Prescott, Ariz., were killed in their Bahia de los Angeles home, about 380 miles south of the U.S. border on the Gulf of California, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

“It was an attempted robbery, and an individual went to defend his property, and that’s when they shot him,” Octavio Lopez, a top local government official, told the Union-Tribune. “This is the first time we’ve had something like this happen.”

Neighbors told the newspaper they believe they were killed over a dispute involving a 22-foot-long fishing boat at the property. A neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said they heard gunfire at around midnight and saw an SUV pulling a boat toward the water. However, the thieves were unable to successfully move it.

Another neighbor, identified by the newspaper as former off-road racing champion Roger Mears, discovered the pair’s bodies. Authorities said Ball had 18 gunshot wounds and Butler had two in her legs.

“We have no memory of having a shooting here,” Tom Mitchell, an American who also has a home in Bahia de los Angeles, told the Union-Tribune. “This has taken it to a level that no one here has experienced.”

Authorities have not released details into what may have led to the shooting. Neighbors told the newspaper that Ball may have heard a noise outside and took his bat to investigate when he was shot as he opened the back door of his home.

“This was so out of character for our community,” Mitchell said. “These guys didn’t hesitate to kill. They basically murdered both of them.”

"Three suspects tied to a New Mexico compound where alleged Muslim extremists reportedly trained children to be school shooters were released from custody on Wednesday, hours after a judge dismissed all of the charges against them, Fox News confirmed.

District Judge Emilio Chavez on Wednesday dismissed charges against three of the five defendants -- Lucas Morton, Subhannah Wahhaj and Hujrah Wahhaj -- ruling that authorities violated the state’s “10-day rule.”

Child abuse charges against them were dropped because prosecutors missed the 10-day limit for an evidentiary hearing to establish probable cause.

During a separate hearing Wednesday, Judge Jeff McElroy dismissed the same charges against fellow defendants, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and Jany Leveille. However, charges leveled against them on Friday, in connection to the death of a missing 3-year-old boy, remained.

Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, the boy's father, and Leveille were charged with abuse of a child resulting in the death of a child and conspiracy to commit abuse of a child, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe announced.

The five suspects were arrested by authorities after an Aug. 3 raid following a monthslong search investigating the disappearance of Abdul-ghani Wahhaj, a 3-year-boy with severe medical issues who went missing from Georgia in December. The occupants of the compound were ""most likely heavily armed and considered extremist of the Muslim belief,"" an official said at the time.

Taos County Sheriff's deputies discovered 11 children at the compound, who were taken into the custody of state child-welfare workers. On Aug. 6, a child’s remains were found on the property.

Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was allegedly training children to commit school shootings, according to prosecutors, who later alleged that the juveniles were taught how to use firearms, as well as tactical techniques, in order to kill teachers, law enforcement and other institutions they found corrupt.

Health officials confirmed earlier this month that the discovered remains were positively identified as the 3-year-old's.

Chavez said Wednesday that it was a very difficult decision to drop the charges but the rule left him with no option. Prosecutors could still seek charges for the three by asking a grand jury to indict them but offered no immediate indication on how they would proceed.

"A diver helping to rescue a group of boys who have been trapped in a cave in Thailand says the kids entered the complex as part of an ""initiation.""

The group of 12 boys entered the Tham Luang cave complex in Chiang Rai province on June 23 with their 25-year-old soccer coach, just after practice had ended. They became trapped after heavy rains flooded key passages.

THAI YOUTH SOCCER TEAM COULD HAVE TO DIVE OUT OF CAVES OR WAIT MONTHS TO BE RESCUED

A Dutch diver who was reportedly part of the group of rescue workers who found the boys told Sky News they were partaking in some sort of ritual.

The boys had left their backpacks and shoes outside the complex ""before wading in and trying to go to the end of the tunnel,"" Ben Reymenants said. ""Sort of like an initiation for local young boys to... write your name on the wall and make it back.""

""Now a flash flood because of sudden heavy rain lock them in,"" the diver said, adding the young boys were strong but were weak in the caves from a lack of food.

Thai SEAL commander Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew said Tuesday that seven members of his unit — including a doctor and a nurse — are now with the group of 13 people in the cave.

His team members ""have given the boys food, starting from easily digested and high-powered food with enough minerals,"" he said at a news conferece.

The commander said having the trapped group dive out of the caves was one of several options being considered. If it were employed, he said they “have to be certain that it will work and have to have a drill to make that it’s 100 percent safe.”

THAI SOCCER TEAM RESCUE EFFORTS 'WILL TAKE TIME': A LOOK AT SOME OF THE OPTIONS

He said there was no rush to bring them out as they are safe where they are.

Teams, according to Thai English-language website Khaosodenglish.com, have been pumping roughly 2,600 gallons of water out of the complex every hour. Water in the cave is reportedly knee-deep, but is neck-deep in the chamber.

Emboldened by his global star power, Mohamed Salah has said out loud what many of his Egyptian teammates have been saying in private for weeks: Failure by the national federation to enforce discipline and stop meddling by sponsors was mostly to blame for the Pharaohs' miserable World Cup run in Russia.

The Liverpool star posted a video clip this week on social media complaining about the chaos at the team's World Cup base in Grozny, capital of Russia's Chechnya region, and calling for better discipline in training camps and security for players.

Salah's agent, lawyer Ramy Abbas, went further in a leaked letter to federation officials, demanding that they improve security for his client or resign. Egypt's wealthiest man, influential business tycoon Naguib Sawiris, echoed his demands in a tweet this week.

The federation rejected Abbas' call for its board to resign, but said it was prepared to discuss Salah's demands.

The latest quarrel between Salah and the federation swiftly dominated the national conversation in Egypt, with fans on social media voicing support for the 26-year-old striker against federation officials they accused of corruption and inefficiency. The hashtag ""resignation of the football federation is a popular demand"" has been trending on Twitter in Egypt since Tuesday.

Egypt lost all three group matches in Russia. It was a bitter disappointment for a soccer-crazy nation, which had waited nearly 30 years to see its national team qualify and hoped that, with Salah leading a group of Europe-based players, the team would do well.

The Pharaohs lost to Uruguay, Russia and Saudi Arabia, with Salah scoring the team's only goals, one against Russia in a 3-1 loss and the second in the 2-1 loss to the Saudis.

There were calls for an official inquiry into the team's poor performance and management of its camp in Russia, including the choice of Grozny as the team's base given the long flights to match venues, but no action was taken.

In the video clip, Salah said uninvited guests kept knocking on his hotel room door in Grozny, keeping him up until 6 a.m. in one instance. Citing the inability of the federation officials to maintain order and shield him from unruly fans, he said he was often told not to join his teammates for meals because of the large number of fans in the restaurant or in the hotel's lobby.

""In all my years abroad, I had never seen anyone bringing his friends to my (hotel) room to shake my hand and take photos with me,"" said Salah, who insisted he was seeking change for the entire squad.

He also said the federation was trying to tarnish his name and accusing him of not being patriotic, a charge that has a familiar ring in a country where the pro-government media routinely label critics as foreign agents or members of an outlawed Islamist group.

""I think people will not believe any of this. People know how I perform when I play for the national squad,"" said Salah, last season's best player and top scorer in the Premier League.

Salah is considered a national hero in Egypt, where many see him as a rare success story at a time of economic malaise and political repression. Egyptian fans are confident his popularity will shield him from the wrath of the government, which has shown zero tolerance for dissent.

But pro-government media, which had previously lavished praise on him, have increasingly sided with the federation in the latest dispute, with some accusing him of being arrogant, ungrateful and seeking exclusive privileges.

Salah's teammates have remained publicly silent so far, reflecting fears of reprisals if they side with him against a federation known to enjoy strong government backing. Goalkeeper Sherif Ikramy, however, was the exception. He tweeted that players agreed with Salah's calls for improved security and discipline.

Two members of Egypt's World Cup squad in Russia, speaking on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals, also backed Salah's complaints.

They cited the example of a TV reporter for a Dubai-based channel who, with the implicit approval of federation officials, knocked at the doors of the players' rooms well past their bedtime offering money in exchange for on-camera interviews.

The two said federation officials were fully aware of this and other transgressions in Grozny, but chose to look the other way to avoid a clash with the team's chief sponsor, a PR and advertising company called Presentation in which the Egyptian government has a majority stake.

Hector Cuper, the Argentine coach who took Egypt to the World Cup, had repeatedly sought to penalize players who breached camp rules in Grozny, but was persuaded not to take action by federation officials, said the two players.

Federation spokesman Osama Ismail acknowledged disciplinary problems in the Grozny camp.

""The players were not well prepared psychologically (for the World Cup) and there was no clarity on regulations governing marketing. That took away the players' focus,"" he told The Associated Press.

Two federation board members, also speaking on condition of anonymity, painted a picture of a complex network of interests between the federation, the government and sponsors that resulted in lax rules in Grozny. They said players were told that public criticism of the company could cost them their place in the squad.

""We were specifically warned against speaking to the media about what went on in Russia,"" said one of the two players.

Presentation officials did not respond to several text messages requesting comment.

Presentation provides most of the advertising going to private television channels, which in turn have several federation board members on lucrative contracts hosting sports talk shows. The company's drive to cash in on Egypt's first qualification for the World Cup since 1990 and on Salah's global celebrity meant that near unfettered access to the players was granted to commercial sponsors.

A three-member media team from a global tea brand, for example, shadowed the Pharaohs in Grozny for at least four days prior to the June 15 Uruguay match. The group regularly posted short video clips of players talking about the tea. Before leaving for Russia, federation officials appeared to go to great lengths to praise Presentation and allow representatives of sponsoring companies to address news conferences broadcast live from the federation's Cairo headquarters.

""You can comfortably say that Presentation and those behind it are running the federation,"" said a board member who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared reprisals. ""There is no direct government meddling in the federation, but what it wants the federation to do is conveyed through Presentation or the Sports Ministry as 'suggestions.'""",world
"Convicted leaker Chelsea Manning will be barred from entering Australia for a scheduled speaking tour set to start Sunday, her event organizer said Thursday.

The Australian government sent Manning’s team a notice of intention to deny the U.S. whistleblower’s entry, said Think Inc. who is organizing the event. The organizers said they gave the government more than 10 letters of support from individuals and organizers who support Manning’s visit to Australia.

""Ms. Manning offers formidable ideas and an insightful perspective which we are hoping to bring to the forefront of Australian dialogue,"" Think Inc. Director Suzi Jamil said in a statement.

All non-citizens visiting Australia must fall under the character requirements put out by the Migration Act. Anyone can be denied if they fail the character test.

Think Inc. is calling on her supporters to lobby new Immigration Minister David Coleman to allow her into the country, where she’s scheduled to speak at the Sydney Opera House and at two other events. While she can appeal, past precedent suggests the decision has already been made.

This isn’t the first time Manning was denied entry to a country. Last year, she was barred from entering Canada, but was later allowed to appear at another event, Reuters reported.

After her trip to Australia, Manning is expected to travel to neighboring New Zealand. Immigration officials in New Zealand are expected to make a decision by Friday on whether to grant her a ""special direction"" visa.

She doesn't qualify for entry otherwise because she has a criminal conviction within the last 10 years for which she had a sentence exceeding 1 year, according to the country's visa rules.

Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison after she was found guilty of leaking military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks. She served seven years in prison before her sentence was commuted in 2017 by then-President Barack Obama.

"President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that North Korea and South Korea will be meeting to end their decades-long war -- and both countries have his “blessing.”

The president also noted that the U.S. has started to engage “at very high levels” with North Korea, ahead of a much-anticipated meeting between Trump and dictator Kim Jong Un set for later this year.

“South Korea is meeting and has plans to meet with North Korea to see if they can end the war,” Trump said at his Florida home at Mar-a-Lago, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe by his side. “They have my blessing on that.”

The war began in 1950. Without ever signing a peace treaty, North and South Korea are technically still at war.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un are set to hold a summit on April 27 in a village on the border, South Korean media and Reuters reported.

South Korean presidential chief of staff Im Jong-seok told reporters Tuesday that his country would hold “working-level” talks on Wednesday and that they may be sending officials to North Korea before next week’s summit for planning purposes.

He also said that the meeting between the two leaders “will confirm the denuclearization” of North Korea.

“We expect the summit will confirm the denuclearization will (of North Korea), and hope to have a comprehensive agreement with the North on the matter,” he said.

An early report also seemed to confirm that at the summit the two sides may announce an official end to the military standoff on the Korean peninsula, Bloomberg reported.

Citing an unidentified South Korean official, the report said neighboring countries may issue a joint statement announcing a relief in military tension and a plan to end confrontation.

President Trump took credit for the open dialogue saying that “without us, without me in particular, I guess you would have to say that they wouldn’t be discussing anything.”

He also talked about meetings between himself and Kim Jong Un, saying it most likely would take place in “early June.”

“We will be having meetings with Kim Jong Un very soon,” he said before adding, “assuming things go well.”

He also said, “Its possible things won’t go well and we won’t have the meeting and we’ll just continue to go along this very strong path that we’ve taken.”

"The leader of an ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan, who was responsible for a spate of recent bombings that left hundreds of civilians dead, was killed in an American drone strike, U.S. officials told Fox News on Sunday.

The deputy spokesperson for Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani announced the death of ISIS-K leader, Abu Sayeed Orakzai, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan spokesman Lt. Col. Martin O’Donnell said.

“I would also add that the United States unrelentingly continues its counterterrorism efforts against ISIS-K, Al-Qaeda, and other regional and international terrorist groups,” O'Donnell said in a statement.

The airstrikes were launched in the Nangarhar province, near the border with Pakistan, according to Agence France-Presse. Ten other ISIS fighters were also killed.

Orakzai is at least the 3rd ISIS-K leader in Afghanistan killed in the past 2 years. The Islamic State has lost around 90 percent of the lands bordering Iraq and Syria since declaring a caliphate in June 2014.

VOICE RECORDING OF ISIS LEADER AL-BAGHDADI PURPORTEDLY EMERGES NEARLY YEAR AFTER THOUGHT KILLED IN STRIKE

The killing of Orakzai comes just takes after an audio recording of the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi apparently resurfaced, in which he congratulated his followers on the occasion of Eid al-Adha, an Islamic holiday, and referenced Turkey’s recent quarrel with the U.S. over its detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson.

He purportedly said “America is going through the worse time in its entire existence,” and said Russia was competing with the U.S. over regional influence and clout.

Al-Baghdadi’s whereabouts has eluded captors since the rise of the Islamic State. His only public appearance was in 2014 in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. His last know audio recording was released on Sept. 28, 2017, and there have been several reports is his death or injury.

Next weekend, a new U.S. military commander will be taking over in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. Scott Miller, the former head of Joint Special Operations Command which oversees the elite commando units Delta Force, SEAL Team 6 and the 75th Ranger Regiment.

The U.S. military has doubled its air strikes in Afghanistan over the past year and increased them fivefold over 2016 levels.

"Around 400 inmates escaped from a prison in Libya's capital Sunday as fighting continued between rival armed groups nearby, reports say.

Guards at the Ain Zara prison in southern Tripoli feared for their lives as the inmates broke free, Reuters reported.

“The detainees were able to force open the doors,” local police said.

The escape came amid increasing heavy fighting between rival groups in the city, prompting the United Nations-backed Libyan government to declare a state of emergency “given the seriousness of the current situation.”

The U.N. called upon the groups to cease the clashes and hold talks Tuesday.

Most of the prisoners were supporters of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who was removed from power following a NATO-backed uprising against his government in 2011, the BBC reported.

Multiple reports said a missile fell Sunday on a camp in Libya's capital that housed displaced people. The hit killed two and wounded seven people, including two children.

Another rocket hit the Waddan hotel in the center of the capital near the Italian Embassy. Three people were reportedly injured.

On Saturday, a rocket hit a state oil firm NOC’s diesel depot that supplied energy to a power station.

The infighting between rival factions – the Seventh Brigade, based outside Tripoli, and the Tripoli Revolutionaries’ Brigades and the Nawasi, both based in the capital – began last week.

The Tripoli-based government, while technically in charge, allows armed groups to operate with relative autonomy as long as they remain allied with the government.

The U.N. called on the “various concerned parties” to gather Tuesday for an “urgent dialogue on the security situation.”

A joint statement Saturday by the U.S., Britain, France and Italy called for an immediate end to violence in Tripoli.

The statement, according to the BBC, said the attempts “to weaken the legitimate Libyan authorities and hinder the ongoing political process are not acceptable.”

“We are calling on the armed groups to immediately stop all military action and warn those who seek to undermine stability, in Tripoli or elsewhere in Libya, that they will be made accountable for it,” it added.

"Iran's president attempted to explain to parliament on Tuesday how he would pull the country out of its economic nosedive, taking shots at the U.S. before lawmakers voted to reject his explanation.

Iranian lawmakers had ordered President Hassan Rouhani to answer for his role in the faltering economy amid growing political divisions in the country. Rouhani claimed that newly reimposed U.S. sanctions after President Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal would only serve to unify the country, according to Reuters.

“I want to assure the Iranian nation that we will not allow the U.S. plot against the Islamic Republic to succeed,” he told parliament. “We will not let this bunch of anti-Iranians in the White House be able to plot against us.”

Iran's currency, the rial, has lost more than two-thirds of its value in a year while the official unemployment rate sits at 12 percent. Youth unemployment, however, is as high as 25 percent in a country where 60 percent of the 80 million population is under 30, according to Reuters.

Earlier this year, nationwide protests erupted over economic anxiety, and lawmakers fired Rouhani's labor and finance ministers this month amid the economic crisis.

IRAN CLAIMS IT CONTROLS STRAIT OF HORMUZ, PROMPTING POMPEO DENIAL

Speaking Tuesday before parliament, Rouhani said those protests only strengthened Trump's hand to pull out of the atomic accord.

""This lured Trump into saying that he will not remain in the deal,"" Rouhani said.

Lawmakers, however, were not satisfied with the president's answer and voted four separate times to say they were unconvinced of his answers about Iran's recession, its cratering currency, unemployment and smuggling, according to the Associated Press.

Those questions now could go to Iran's judiciary for further review, serving as a warning to the cleric his political stature is slipping.

IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: WHAT IS IT?

In recent days, rhetoric from Iran has increased as a top Iranian Navy general said that the country has taken full control of the Strait of Hormuz and Persian Gulf.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded Monday night, saying: ""The Islamic Republic of Iran does not control the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait is an international waterway. The United States will continue to work with our partners to ensure freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in international waterways.""

Military officials echoed similar statements on Tuesday at a briefing with reporters at the Pentagon.

The first-ever visit of a leader of the Philippines is sure to be touted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as another success in his campaign to enhance Israel's relations across the globe. But critics say this outreach has come at a cost, with Netanyahu cozying up to authoritarian leaders, some of whom are guilty of human rights abuses.

Netanyahu takes great pride that under his leadership Israel has found new friends in Europe, as well as in far-flung countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America that long sided with the Palestinians at the United Nations and other global bodies.

But while many of Netanyahu's new allies have offered blanket support for Israel, or at least indifference to its conflict with the Palestinians, some have also voiced borderline anti-Semitic sentiments and adopted a revisionist approach to the most painful chapters of Jewish history.

The Philippines' foul-mouthed president, Rodrigo Duterte, who has cursed out everyone from Barack Obama to God, will receive a warm welcome in the Holy Land.

He arrives in Israel on Sunday for a four-day visit, the first presidential visit since the countries established diplomatic relations in 1957. He is expected to lunch with Netanyahu, meet other top officials and visit the country's Holocaust memorial. He is also expected to sign a major oil deal and view an arms display.

His forces are accused of killing thousands in anti-drug raids since he took office in 2016. Duterte drew outrage that year when he compared his anti-drug campaign to the Holocaust, and himself to Hitler, saying he would be ""happy to slaughter"" 3 million addicts. He later apologized. More recently, he forcibly kissed a woman on stage and said there would be many rape cases in a Philippine city ""if there were many beautiful women.""

Israeli human rights activists plan to protest the visit and have encouraged President Reuven Rivlin not to meet Duterte. ""Certainly there is no place for a mass murderer and a person who supports rape, shooting women in their sexual organs and bombing schools to meet with Israel's president,"" wrote the group, headed by human rights attorney Eitay Mack.

Netanyahu's critics accuse him of giving a pass to authoritarian leaders out of political considerations. Here's a look at some of Netanyahu's other friends on the world stage:

VIKTOR ORBAN

Netanyahu welcomed the four-time Hungarian prime minister for a visit in July as a ""true friend of Israel.""

Orban drew criticism last year for praising Miklos Horthy, Hungary's World War II-era ruler, who introduced anti-Semitic laws and collaborated with the Nazis.

Critics have also accused Orban of employing anti-Semitic tropes against the Jewish Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist George Soros during his re-election campaign. In denouncing Soros, Orban said Hungary's enemies ""do not believe in work, but speculate with money; they have no homeland, but feel that the whole world is theirs.""

Despite global Jewish condemnation of those remarks, Netanyahu praised Orban for combatting anti-Semitism and thanked him for Hungary's pro-Israel stance.

Orban, who has exhibited increasing authoritarianism at home, has cast himself as the champion of a Christian Europe and adopted an aggressive stance to halt the flow of African and Muslim migrants through Hungary.

ANDRZEJ DUDA

Netanyahu took a lot of heat for striking a deal with the Polish president over his country's controversial Holocaust speech law, which would have criminalized blaming the Polish nation for crimes committed against Jews during World War II.

Critics said Netanyahu appeared to capitulate to the claim that Poles were only victims of the Nazis, while historians say anti-Semitism was deeply rooted in pre-war Poland and many Poles collaborated in the genocide.

Poland and Hungary have increasingly sided with Israel in the Mideast conflict, in contrast to Western European powers, which have sympathized with the Palestinians and pressed for renewed peace talks.

Duda's Law and Justice party, meanwhile, has steadily chipped away at Polish democratic institutions while aggressively trying to minimize its citizens' role in killing Jews during and after the Second World War.

___

VLADIMIR PUTIN

Netanyahu is one of the few world leaders to enjoy warm ties with both the Russian and American presidents. Netanyahu has made frequent visits to Moscow in recent years to meet with Putin and coordinate Israeli operations in neighboring Syria with those of Russian forces.

Though Russia has traditionally backed Israel's Arab neighbors, Netanyahu has indicated the Putin backchannel has helped keep Israel out of trouble in Syria's civil war and would be beneficial in getting arch-enemy Iran's forces out of there as well. He has been wary of ever criticizing Putin, who has been accused by the West of meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, poisoning former spies and cracking down on dissidents.

___

DONALD TRUMP

After a rocky eight-year relationship with Barack Obama, Netanyahu has relished Donald Trump's warm embrace. In a break from his predecessors, Trump has refrained from criticizing Israeli settlement activity and delivered Netanyahu two major international gifts — recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal. Trump has also won Israeli praise for drastically cutting funding for aid to the Palestinians.

Netanyahu has vouched for Trump when the president's critics have accused him of failing to counter the anti-Semitic rhetoric of some of his supporters and of downplaying the rise of white nationalists, including those who marched in Charlottesville last year under the slogan ""Jews will not replace us.""

At times, Netanyahu also has seemed to follow Trump's lead. The Israeli leader has denounced the media, the legal system and other perceived opponents in the face of growing legal problems — often using social media platforms to unleash his attacks.

"Germany faces a growing threat from children raised in Salafist families, according to the country’s domestic intelligence service.

A recent report issued by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), warned that these children are “educated from birth with an extremist world view that legitimizes violence against others and degrades those who aren’t part of their group.”

The radicalization of youngsters is happening faster and earlier, according to Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germany’s BfV.

Frank Jansen, a journalist with Berlin’s centrist paper Der Tagesspiegel, and an expert on extremism in Germany, notes that most of the Salafist minors in the BfV report are younger than eight-years-old. According to Jansen, the report calls these children ticking time bombs.

ANGELA MERKEL ADMITS THAT 'NO-GO ZONES' EXIST IN GERMANY

""Their education is especially fanatic when militant parents propagate holy war,” Jansen wrote.

Salafism is an Islamist ideology that advocates the replacement of democratic government and law with a theocratic state based on Sharia. Since it first appeared in Germany in 2004, the number of Salafists has nearly tripled to 10,800, with nearly a quarter of them under the age of 26. It is the fastest growing Islamist trend in Germany.

Although not all Salafists advocate violence, the report stresses, the affirmation of violence is an inherent part of Salafist ideology.

Many Salafists are German converts to Islam. Others come from Turkish Muslim families who have lived in Germany since the late 1960’s. The report does not take into account the 1.5 million Muslim refugees who came to Germany from Syria and Afghanistan in 2015-16, according to a BfV spokesman.

Salafism has special allure for marginalized Muslim adults and youth.

ANTI-MUSLIM TWEET LANDS GERMAN MINISTER IN HOT WATER WITH POLICE

“It’s like an ersatz family for some youths,” said Claudia Dantschke, an expert on Islam and head of the Office for Islamism and Ultra-Nationalism, a Berlin-based NGO. “It’s where they find recognition and security.”

It also appeals to those who feel they are victims of bias in German society. The movement asserts that devotion to Islam enables Muslims to have an identification beyond the nation where they live.

Salafist recruiters are effective because, unlike the imams at most German mosques who preach in Arabic or Turkish, they preach in German, often using teenage slang. The indoctrination and radicalization are also effective because recruitment often takes place in small circles and online, according to the report.

Salafism’s growing infiltration of the Berlin public schools also corresponds with an increase in anti-Semitism in the classrooms, according to an August 2017 study by the American Jewish Committee Office in Berlin.

Anti-Semitism is an essential element in the ideology of the entire Islamist spectrum, according to the BfV report. This propaganda uses age-old stereotypes and prejudices, prevalent from medieval times through the Nazi era.

Conservative members of the German parliament have reacted to the Salafist threat with a call for police monitoring of Muslim children under age 14, the lowest age currently permitted in most German states. Civil rights organizations, however, have voiced strong objections to such surveillance. Humanist Union, a civil rights group, says it is unreasonable to consider children a threat because their ideas and opinions are not fully developed and are subject to change.

“This is not about criminalizing people under the age of 14,” counters Patrick Sensburg, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, “But about warding off significant threats to our country.”

Gotz Nordbruch, co-head of Ufuq, a German-based organization that deals with primary prevention in the realm of religious extremism, objects to the amount of attention that is being focused on Salafist youngsters.

Nordbruch noted that the 24,000 rightwing, neo-Nazi extremists in Germany are more numerous than the Salafists and sworn to a more visible violence. No one would consider investigating their children, he said, pointing out that the debate stigmatizes Muslim youngsters and makes them afraid to talk about the things that are relevant to them.

While acknowledging that the relatively small number of Salafists may be reaching as many as 300,000 people through social media, Nordbruch is working to train teachers to engage constructively with vulnerable children.

“My view is that this exaggerated attention on these kids is actually polarizing society more than necessary,” he said, referring to the calls for police investigation of young Muslim children.",world
"South Africa’s solidarity union will launch a strike on Monday over a share ownership program offered only to black staff at Sasol, the global leader in technology conversion from coal and gas to fuel.

“We intend to switch off a different section of Sasol each day by means of well-laid and strategic plans,” the white-majority, 6,300-person union said in a statement Saturday, noting that it has planned for three weeks of industrial action.

Under black economic empowerment regulations, South African companies are mandated to adhere to quotas on black ownership, employment and acquisition as one aspect of an overall effort to counter decades of omission under apartheid.

The major petrochemicals firm – which has around 26,000 employees at provincial operations – recently initiated a new 10-year staff share program called Khanyisa, in which white workers and foreign nations are prohibited. The new scheme comes on the heels of the previous Inzalo strategy, which included white employees.

“Sasol therefore had a history of inclusion,” the union statement continued. “But now it has a future of exclusion.”

The latest development comes amid rising controversy in South Africa over alleged acts of “land and farm reform” in South Africa, which prompted an unexpected tweet from President Trump last month asking Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to examine the “land and farm seizures and expropriations and large scale killing of farmers” in the country.

MORE IRANIANS 'BUYING' PASSPORTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES TO EVADE US TRAVEL BAN, SANCTIONS

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WALKING BACK OBAMA-ERA FOREIGN POLICY MISTAKES IN BURMA

The South African rand instantly fell 1.9 percent and Pompeo and U.S Trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, are said to be contemplating ousting South Africa from the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).

The country’s government hastily dismissed Trump’s tweet, insisting that the U.S president was mistaken and that the program to clinch land from whites to distribute to blacks would be carried out in a “careful and inclusive manner that does not divide our nation.”

The U.S Embassy in South Africa also rebuked the assertions, issuing a cable highlighting that “farmers suggested that they are more vulnerable to violence because of the remoteness of the farms and inadequate responses of law enforcement agencies, but they also noted that farm violence has never resulted in any kind of land seizure.”

The cable further assailed that “some journalists and lobby groups have simplified complex land disputes to serve their own ends.” Much of the media, too, disected Trump's comments as missing the mark.

Nonetheless, security experts and analysts anticipate that the hot-button issue is not going to simmer anytime soon, and could have considerable consequences.

“Land expropriation by the current government is not only unethical it is dangerous. The desperate and the criminal will take advantage of this, killing of white farmers was already an issue, this new forced transference of property will exacerbate this criminal issue and promote violence,” Tony Schiena, a South African former intelligence operative and owner of private security firm MOSAIC told Fox News. “I fail to believe that there will not be an uprising in the right wing or that it won’t gain support by those white people who previously were not fundamentally right. I would think that an underground regrouping of the right would be prevalent and defensive action would be forthcoming.”

And according to international banking and affairs analyst Dennis Santiago, the alleged “reverse apartheid” is a “strategic mistake for the country.”

“The goal when apartheid ended was that South Africa would become a beacon for all of Africa to live in better harmony. The Marxist contingent of the present South African government risks taking a great country and turning it back into a Third World mediocre one,” he added. “It would be unfortunate for all of Africa if that happened. South Africa is vital to regional stability. It brought stability to half of that continent for decades. It is still relied upon to do so. What happens in South Africa will have consequences to the rest of the continent. This is a ticking time bomb.”",world

prev

Again and again over the past two years, a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the United States has claimed it won decisive victories that drove Al Qaeda militants from their strongholds across Yemen and shattered their ability to attack the West.

Here's what the victors did not disclose: many of their conquests came without firing a shot.

That's because the coalition cut secret deals with Al Qaeda fighters, paying some to leave key cities and towns and letting others retreat with weapons, equipment and wads of looted cash, an investigation by The Associated Press has found. Hundreds more were recruited to join the coalition itself.

These compromises and alliances have allowed Al Qaeda militants to survive to fight another day — and risk strengthening the most dangerous branch of the terror network that carried out the 9/11 attacks. Key participants in the pacts said the U.S. was aware of the arrangements and held off on any drone strikes.

The deals uncovered by the AP reflect the contradictory interests of the two wars being waged simultaneously in this southwestern corner of the Arabian Peninsula.

In one conflict, the U.S. is working with its Arab allies — particularly the United Arab Emirates — with the aim of eliminating the branch of extremists known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP. But the larger mission is to win the civil war against the Houthis, Iranian-backed Shiite rebels. And in that fight, Al Qaeda militants are effectively on the same side as the Saudi-led coalition — and, by extension, the United States.

""Elements of the U.S. military are clearly aware that much of what the U.S. is doing in Yemen is aiding AQAP and there is much angst about that,"" said Michael Horton, a fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, a U.S. analysis group that tracks terrorism.

""However, supporting the UAE and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia against what the U.S. views as Iranian expansionism takes priority over battling AQAP and even stabilizing Yemen,"" Horton said.

The AP's findings are based on reporting in Yemen and interviews with two dozen officials, including Yemeni security officers, militia commanders, tribal mediators and four members of Al Qaeda's branch. All but a few of those sources spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals. Emirati-backed factions, like most armed groups in Yemen, have been accused of abducting or killing their critics.

Coalition-backed militias actively recruit Al Qaeda militants, or those who were recently members, because they're considered exceptional fighters, the AP found.

The coalition forces are comprised of a dizzying mix of militias, factions, tribal warlords and tribes with very local interests. And AQAP militants are intertwined with many of them.

One Yemeni commander who was put on the U.S. terrorism list for Al Qaeda ties last year continues to receive money from the UAE to run his militia, his own aide told the AP. Another commander, recently granted $12 million for his fighting force by Yemen's president, has a known Al Qaeda figure as his closest aide.

In one case, a tribal mediator who brokered a deal between the Emiratis and Al Qaeda even gave the extremists a farewell dinner.

Horton said much of the war on Al Qaeda by the UAE and its allied militias is a ""farce.""

""It is now almost impossible to untangle who is AQAP and who is not since so many deals and alliances have been made,"" he said.

The U.S. has sent billions of dollars in weapons to the coalition to fight the Iran-backed Houthis. U.S. advisers also give the coalition intelligence used in targeting on-the-ground adversaries in Yemen, and American jets provide air-to-air refueling for coalition war planes. The U.S. does not fund the coalition, however, and there is no evidence that American money went to AQAP militants.

The U.S. is aware of an Al Qaeda presence among the anti-Houthi ranks, a senior American official told reporters in Cairo earlier this year. Because coalition members back militias with hard-line Islamic commanders, ""it's very, very easy for Al Qaeda to insinuate itself into the mix,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under the terms of the briefing.

More recently, the Pentagon vigorously denied any complicity with Al Qaeda militants.

""Since the beginning of 2017, we have conducted more than 140 strikes to remove key AQAP leaders and disrupt its ability to use ungoverned spaces to recruit, train and plan operations against the U.S. and our partners across the region,"" Navy Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, wrote in an email to the AP.

A senior Saudi official commented by saying that the Saudi-led coalition ""continues its commitment to combat extremism and terrorism.""

An Emirati government spokesman did not reply to questions from the AP.

But on Monday, Emirati Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash tweeted that the UAE-backed counter-terrorism strategy is working. He said it had ""removed"" thousands of militants and deprived them of safe havens.

AQAP is ""at its weakest since 2012,"" he wrote, adding that the UAE and its allies ""have all lost troops in the fight.""

The coalition began fighting in Yemen in 2015 after the Houthis overran the north, including the capital, Sanaa. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are determined to stop what they consider a move by their nemesis, Iran, to take over Yemen, and their professed aim is to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.

Al Qaeda is leveraging the chaos to its advantage.

""The United States is certainly in a bind in Yemen,"" said Katherine Zimmerman, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ""It doesn't make sense that the United States has identified Al Qaeda as a threat, but that we have common interests inside of Yemen and that, in some places, it looks like we're looking the other way.""

Within this complicated conflict, Al Qaeda says its numbers — which U.S. officials have estimated at 6,000 to 8,000 members — are rising.

An Al Qaeda commander who helps organize deployments told the AP that the front lines against the Houthis provide fertile ground to recruit new members.

""Meaning, if we send 20, we come back with 100,"" he said.

The well-known commander communicated with AP via a secure messaging app on condition of anonymity because he had no authorization from the group to talk to the news media.

A FAREWELL DINNER FOR AL QAEDA

In February, Emirati troops and their Yemeni militia allies flashed victory signs to TV cameras as they declared the recapture of al-Said, a district of villages running through the mountainous province of Shabwa — an area Al Qaeda had largely dominated for nearly three years.

It was painted as a crowning victory in a months-long offensive, Operation Swift Sword, that the Emirati ambassador to Washington, Yousef al-Otaiba, had proclaimed would ""disrupt the terrorist organization's network and degrade its ability to conduct future attacks.""

The Pentagon, which assisted with a small number of troops, echoed that promise, saying the mission would weaken the group's ability to use Yemen as a base.

But weeks before those forces' entry, a string of pickup trucks mounted with machine guns and loaded with masked Al Qaeda militants drove out of al-Said unmolested, according to a tribal mediator involved in the deal for their withdrawal.

The U.S. has killed Al Qaeda's top leaders in a drone strike campaign that accelerated in recent years. But in this victory — as in the others touted by the coalition — the mediator said armed U.S. drones were absent, despite the large, obvious convoy.

Under the terms of the deal, the coalition promised Al Qaeda members it would pay them to leave, according to Awad al-Dahboul, the province's security chief. His account was confirmed by the mediator and two Yemeni government officials.

Al-Dahboul said about 200 Al Qaeda members received payments. He did not learn the exact amounts, but said he knew that 100,000 Saudi rials ($26,000) were paid to one Al Qaeda commander — in the presence of Emiratis.

Under the accord, thousands of local tribal fighters were to be enlisted in the UAE-funded Shabwa Elite Force militia. For every 1,000 fighters, 50 to 70 would be Al Qaeda members, the mediator and two officials said.

Saleh bin Farid al-Awlaqi, a pro-Emirati tribal leader who was the founder of one Elite Force branch, denied any agreements were made. He said he and others enticed young Al Qaeda members in Shabwa to defect, which weakened the group, forcing it to withdraw on its own. He said about 150 fighters who defected were allowed into the Elite Force, but only after they underwent a ""repentance"" program.

The clearing of Al Qaeda from Shabwa and other provinces did not completely take place without fighting. Clashes erupted in some villages, usually with Al Qaeda remnants that refused to play ball.

One former Al Qaeda member told the AP that he and his comrades turned down an offer of money from the Emiratis. In response, he said, an Elite Force squad besieged them in the town of Hawta until they withdrew.

Overall, deals that took place during both the Obama and Trump administrations have secured Al Qaeda militants' withdrawal from multiple major towns and cities that the group seized in 2015, the AP found. The earliest pact, in the spring of 2016, allowed thousands of Al Qaeda fighters to pull out of Mukalla, Yemen's fifth-largest city and a major port on the Arabian Sea.

The militants were guaranteed a safe route out and allowed to keep weapons and cash looted from the city — up to $100 million by some estimates — according to five sources, including military, security and government officials.

""Coalition fighter jets and U.S. drones were idle,"" said a senior tribal leader who saw the convoy leaving. ""I was wondering why they didn't strike them.""

A tribal sheikh shuttled between AQAP leaders in Mukalla and Emirati officials in Aden to seal the deal, according to a former senior Yemeni commander.

Coalition-backed forces moved in two days later, announcing that hundreds of militants were killed and hailing the capture as ""part of joint international efforts to defeat the terrorist organizations in Yemen.""

No witnesses reported militants killed, however. ""We woke up one day and Al Qaeda had vanished without a fight,"" a local journalist said, speaking to AP on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

Soon after, another accord was struck for AQAP to pull out of six towns in the province of Abyan, including its capital, Zinjibar, according to five tribal mediators involved in the negotiations.

Again, the central provision was that the coalition and U.S. drones cease all bombings as AQAP pulled out with its weapons, the mediators said.

The agreement also included a provision that 10,000 local tribesmen — including 250 Al Qaeda militants — be incorporated into the Security Belt, the UAE-backed Yemeni force in the area, four Yemeni officials said.

For nearly a week in May 2016, the militants departed in trucks. One of the mediators told the AP that he threw the last of the departing fighters a farewell dinner among his olive and lemon orchards when they stopped at his farm to pay their respects.

Another mediator, Tarek al-Fadhli, a former jihadi once trained by Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, said he was in touch with officials at the U.S. Embassy and in the Saudi-led coalition, keeping them updated on the withdrawal.

""When the last one left, we called the coalition to say they are gone,"" he said.

'WE WILL UNITE WITH THE DEVIL'

To think of Al Qaeda as an international terror group is to miss its other reality. For many Yemenis, it is simply another faction on the ground — a very effective one, well-armed and battle-hardened.

Its members are not shadowy strangers. Over the years, AQAP has woven itself into society by building ties with tribes, buying loyalties and marrying into major families.

Power players often see it as a useful tool.

Hadi's predecessor as Yemen's president, long-ruling strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, set the model. He took billions in U.S. aid to combat Al Qaeda after the 9/11 attacks, even as he recruited its militants to fight his rivals. Hadi's current vice president, Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, a military chief for decades, also has been accused of enlisting jihadis.

In that light, it would almost be more startling if the militants were not involved against the Houthis, especially since Al Qaeda militants are extremist Sunnis seeking the defeat of the Shiite rebels.

Al Qaeda militants are present on all major front lines fighting the rebels, Khaled Baterfi, a senior leader in the group, said in a previously unpublished 2015 interview with a local journalist obtained by the AP.

Last month, Baterfi said in a Q&A session distributed by Al Qaeda that ""those at the front lines for sure know of our participation, which is either actual fighting with our brothers in Yemen or supporting them with weapons.""

Al Qaeda has reduced attacks against Hadi's and Emirati-linked forces because assailing them would benefit the Houthis, Baterfi said.

The branch is following guidance from Al Qaeda's worldwide leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, to focus on fighting the rebels, another top AQAP member said in written answers to the AP.

In some places, militants join battles independently. But in many cases, militia commanders from the ultraconservative Salafi sect and the Muslim Brotherhood bring them directly into their ranks, where they benefit from coalition funding, the AP found. The Brotherhood's Yemen branch is a powerful hard-line Islamic political organization allied to Hadi.

Two of the four main coalition-backed commanders along the Red Sea coast are allies of Al Qaeda, the Al Qaeda member said. The coalition has made major advances on the coast, and is currently battling for the port of Hodeida.

Video footage shot by the AP in January 2017 showed a coalition-backed unit advancing on Mocha, part of an eventually successful campaign to recapture the Red Sea town.

Some of the unit's fighters were openly Al Qaeda, wearing Afghan-style garb and carrying weapons with the group's logo. As they climbed behind machine guns in pick-up trucks, explosions from coalition airstrikes could be seen on the horizon.

An AQAP member interviewed in person by the AP in May viewed the video and confirmed the fighters belonged to his group. His affiliation is known from his past involvement in AQAP's rule over a southern city.

The impact of the intertwining of Al Qaeda fighters with the coalition campaign is clearest in Taiz, Yemen's largest city and center of one of the war's longest running battles.

In the central highlands, Taiz is Yemen's cultural capital, a historic source of poets and writers and educated technocrats. In 2015, the Houthis laid siege to the city, occupying surrounding mountain ranges, sealing the entrances and shelling it mercilessly.

Taiz residents rose up to fight back, and coalition cash and weapons poured in — as did Al Qaeda and Islamic State militants, all aimed at the same enemy.

One liberal activist took up arms alongside other men from his neighborhood to defend the city, and they found themselves fighting side by side with Al Qaeda members.

""There is no filtering in the war. We are all together,"" said the activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said commanders received weapons and other aid from the coalition and distributed it to all the fighters, including Al Qaeda militants.

Abdel-Sattar al-Shamiri, a former adviser to Taiz's governor, said he recognized Al Qaeda's presence from the start and told commanders not to recruit members.

""Their response was, 'We will unite with the devil in the face of Houthis,'"" al-Shamiri said.

He said he warned coalition officials, who were ""upset"" but took no action.

""Taiz is in danger,"" al-Shamiri said. ""We will get rid of the Houthis and we will be stuck with terrorist groups.""

The activist and officials in the city said one of the main recruiters of Al Qaeda fighters is Adnan Rouzek, a Salafi member tapped by Hadi to be a top military commander.

Rouzek's militia became notorious for kidnappings and street killings, with one online video showing its masked members shooting a kneeling, blindfolded man. Its videos feature Al Qaeda-style anthems and banners.

Rouzek's top aide was a senior Al Qaeda figure who escaped from a prison in Aden in 2008 along with other AQAP detainees, according to a Yemeni security official. Multiple photos seen by the AP show Rouzek with known Al Qaeda commanders in recent years.

In November, Hadi named Rouzek head of the Taiz Operations Rooms, coordinating the military campaign, and top commander of a new fighting force, the 5th Presidential Protection Battalion. Hadi's Defense Ministry also gave Rouzek $12 million for a new offensive against the Houthis. The AP obtained copy of a receipt for the $12 million and a Rouzek aide confirmed the figure.

Rouzek denied any connection to militants, telling the AP that ""there is no presence of Al Qaeda"" in Taiz.

Another coalition-backed warlord is on the U.S. list of designated terrorists due to his ties to Al Qaeda.

The warlord, a Salafi known as Sheikh Aboul Abbas, has received millions of dollars from the coalition to distribute among anti-Houthi factions, according to his aide, Adel al-Ezzi. Despite being put on the U.S. list in October, the UAE continues to fund him, al-Ezzi told the AP.

The aide denied any links to militants and dismissed his boss's designation on the U.S. terror list. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that ""Al Qaeda has fought on all the front lines alongside all factions.""

Right after the AP team spoke to him in Taiz, the team saw al-Ezzi meeting with a known senior Al Qaeda figure, warmly hugging him outside the home of another former AQAP commander.

Aboul Abbas runs a coalition-funded militia controlling several districts in Taiz. A 2016 video produced by Al Qaeda shows militants in black uniforms with Al Qaeda's logo fighting alongside other militias in districts known to be under his control.

A former security official in Taiz said militants and Aboul Abbas' forces attacked security headquarters in 2017 and freed a number of Al Qaeda suspects. The officer said he reported the attack to the coalition, only to learn soon after that it gave Aboul Abbas 40 more pick-up trucks.

""The more we warn, the more they are rewarded,"" the officer said. ""Al Qaeda leaders have armored vehicles given to them by the coalition while security commanders don't have such vehicles.""

"More than 100 U.S. Marines launched an air assault in the southern Syrian desert backed by artillery fire to send a “strong message” to Russia not to send their forces inside a restricted area near an American military outpost, two U.S. defense officials have told Fox News.

The show of forces comes as the leaders of Iran, Russia and Turkey are meeting Friday in Tehran to hammer out their next steps in the seven-year Syrian civil war ahead of an expected offensive led by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces into the country’s northwest Idlib Province.

On two separate occasions this month (Sept. 1 and Sept. 6), the Russian military warned its American counterparts of its intention to conduct a military operation in southern Syria near the At Tanf garrison where U.S. special operations forces are located.

Twice the U.S. military has told the Russians to back off.

“The United States does not seek to fight the Russians, the government of Syria or any groups that may be providing support to Syria in the Syrian civil war,” Navy Capt. William Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in a statement.

“The U.S. does not require any assistance in our efforts to destroy ISIS.”

In Tehran, the trilateral summit between Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was meant to finalize military plans for the “total annihilation of terrorists in Syria,” Putin said.

The area is home to three million people, including hundreds of thousands of civilians living among rebel fighters including thousands with ties to al-Qaeda.

The Trump administration has warned Syria, Russia and Iran not to kick-start the offensive over fear of civilian casualties leading to continued bloodshed in a civil war that has lasted seven years.

IRAN, NORTH KOREA AND VENEZUELA TURNING TO CRYPTOCURRENCY TO BYPASS US SANCTIONS, EXPERTS WARN

Earlier this week, President Trump tweeted: ""President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province. The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy.""Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don't let that happen!""

The warning appeared to have been ignored after Russian jets began bombarding Idlib.

“We consider any assault on Idlib to be a dangerous escalation of the conflict in Syria,” said U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley Friday in New York. “Airstrikes by Russia and the regime have already begun against civilian areas.

“The atrocities committed by Assad will be a permanent stain on history and a black mark for this council which was blocked over and over by Russia from taking action to help,” she added.

In a statement describing the air-assault that took place Friday night in Syria, a spokesman for the U.S. military’s Central Command, responsible for all American forces in the Middle East, said it was an effort to “demonstrate the capability to deploy rapidly, assault a target with integrated air and ground forces, and conduct a rapid exfiltration anywhere in the Operation Inherent Resolve combined joint operations area.”

TRUMP REPORTEDLY APPROVES NEW OBJECTIVES IN SYRIA, KEEPING MILITARY PRESENCE INDEFINITELY

“Exercises like this bolster our defeat-ISIS capabilities and ensure we are ready to respond to any threat to our forces,” said Navy Capt. Bill Urban.

A threat some took as going beyond ISIS but to Moscow.

The rare show of force in Syria comes months after U.S. aircraft -- including AC-130 gunships, jets and bombers -- killed roughly 300 Russian mercenaries near Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria after American special operations forces came under attack.

“The Russians agreed to a [34 mile] ‘deconfliction zone’ around the At Tanf garrison to avoid accidental conflict between our forces, and to remain professionally engaged through de-confliction channels. We expect the Russians to abide by this agreement,” Urban said.

The Russian government has long called for the 2,000 U.S. military troops to leave Syria.

The Russian provocations were not limited to Syria. Friday, the North American Aerospace Defense Command said a pair of fifth generation U.S. F-22 stealth jet fighters from Alaska intercepted a pair of long-range nuclear-capable Tu-95 “Bear” bombers last Saturday flying south of the Aleutian Islands. It was the first known flight of Russian bombers near the United States since May.

"While pro-Assad bombs fall around Idlib province – the last opposition stronghold in Syria’s long-running civil war – those trapped inside the city of the same name can only wait for the inevitable last battle, with nowhere left to hide.

“We are afraid of Assad bombing our homes, we are concerned about death – but after seven years we are used to this. Only now, there are no safe places left. There are no safe areas,” Suhaib Monzer Zakour, a 25-year-old media activist inside Idlib, told Fox News in a telephone interview.

“So for now, people here just try to live their lives. They go to work, they go shopping. We don’t know what will happen. But we would rather die than flee to the regime side. That is not an option for us.”

The latest escalation comes as residents of Idlib and many players in the international community, including President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, express new concerns about a Syrian attack on Idlib. And U.S officials believe Assad has already given his approval to the use of chlorine gas in Idlib, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

Despite staunch denials from Damascus and Moscow, the UN has accused the Syrian regime of using chemical weapons against its own citizens more than two dozen times. In April, a chemical attack in Idlib's Khan Sheikhoun left more than 80 civilians dead.

“There is little people can do due to economic vulnerability and poverty, but some are now trying to build gas shields with simple equipment,” explained Moaed Tomah, a 28-year-old political science student in Idlib. “It is just a plastic bag with an empty water bottle punctured, sometimes with charcoal or cotton inside. But this might not be enough to save them.”

The latest uptick of Syria and Russian airstrikes resumed with intensity over the weekend, following failed ceasefire negotiations between Russia, Iran and Turkey at a trilateral summit in Tehran. For now, the city center of Idlib is peaceful. Yet many can feel the clock ticking.

Some residents said they are storing food and medicines, while others are simply praying for the best.

“People are living in fear and anticipation because they know well what Assad and Russia are capable of. Life is functioning, but we are scared,” said Mohamed Barakat, 32, a manager of a cultural center in the western Aleppo countryside. “Civilians cannot protect themselves. Even underground basements that civilians used to seek refuge in during airstrikes were previously targeted with highly destructive bombs, and are not a safe option anymore.”

Idlib markets are bursting with life, as men ride through the streets on old motorcycles, while others clutch their prayer beads in quiet corners. Little boys peddle rusty bicycles, play soccer open the open spaces and work from dusk to dawn selling bread from the stands, as little girls sing and clap giddily – having known no other life outside of civil war.

“We are doing our best to continue with normal life. It is our sign of resistance, our sign that we just want to live,” said Mariam Shirout, a 38-year-old school teacher and manager of a children’s center in Idlib. “But only 50 percent of children are attending school, because families are so afraid that the school will be bombed.”

After more than seven years of conflict between the Bashar al-Assad government and various rebel factions, the northwestern pocket of Syria – comprising most of Idlib as well as neighboring small parcels of Latakia, Hama and Aleppo provinces – is now overflowing with more than three million people. Roughly half are already displaced, having escaped other parts of Syria, or resettled as part of a deal brokered between rebels and government forces.

The looming likelihood of an all-out assault by pro-Assad forces, with support from its key allies Russia and Iran, has forced more than a thousand civilians to helplessly run toward the Turkish border in recent days. Nonetheless, Turkey – which has already taken in millions of Syrian refugees and remains a backer of rebel forces – has clamped its border closed, leaving those in Idlib with little choice but to wait in place and hope, hover in displacement tents near the border, or return to regime areas and face possible retribution.

“People here, especially activists, journalists and humanitarian staff, cannot flee to regime areas because the regime will come after them and they will face the same fate of detainees who died under torture in Assad’s prisons,” Barakat asserted. “Fleeing or reconciling with the regime is not an option for anyone who opposed Assad.”

Some in Idlib city are still attempting to sell what little they have left in an effort to collect money in the hopes of being able to pay a smuggler to take them into Turkey when the Idlib fall begins. But that journey – while only around 30 miles – is fraught with danger.

“A few are still trying to cross the border through illegal movements,” Zakour said. “But Turkish border guards will shoot at them.”

Multiple activists and rebel fighters in Idlib told Fox News most of the recent military action has come from the air. But there's increasing concern the regime is assembling forces from other parts of the country, prelude for a massive ground attack.

According to Dr. Khaled Almilaji, a 37-year-old physician and CEO of humanitarian medical NGO SIMRO, the bombing of hospitals and healthcare facilities – an apparent signature strategy of the regime throughout the war – has begun, with three facilities “attacked directly” in the last three days alone.

“These people are already suffering from bad humanitarian conditions due to the lack of many essential services like health, education, and drinking water,” he lamented. “However, they loved the freedom they have in north-western Syria. They have for the first time in their lives the rights that they, and their parents, didn’t have for tens of years.”

SURVIVORS OF SYRIA CHEMICAL ATTACK 'FORCED TO LEAVE OR DIE'

FROM JAIL, REMORSEFUL EX-ISIS FIGHTER WARNS: GROUP WILL RETOOL AND RETURN

Tomah said “propaganda” has been circulating from the Assad side that the White Helmets, also known as the Syrian Civil Defense – a volunteer organization of first responder and rescue workers in rebel-controlled regions – are “preparing to carry out a chemical attack on civilians,” igniting steep worry that they are in fact setting the stage for a sinister cover-up.

Residents say the White Helmets have, rather, been holding basic medical and survival training sessions and running an “awareness campaign” in Idlib to prepare locals for a possible chemical incursion.

“These are to guide people with steps of what to do in such an event, and there are basic points published and distributed on how to make masks and cover the body and how to isolate a room and equip it with things like a water tank as a means of protection,” said Emad Batieh, 37, manager of Alrowad Schools.

Abdullah al Husain, a White Helmets board member in Idlib, told Fox News they stand ready to help.

“We are just waiting,” he said. “We are waiting for something; we don’t know what that something will be.”

Pro-government media outlets insist the latest ramp-up of aerial bombardment is in retaliation to shelling from rebel posts, in keeping with the government’s mandate that all opposition members are “terrorists.”

There are an estimated 10,000 rebel fighters left in and around Idlib. And the Russians insist their air attacks are targeting only those forces, while sparing civilian areas.

Some in Idlib remain hopeful for a last-ditch crack of hope that somehow, someone will save the day.

“We are besieged. Everyday life is difficult. But I will never forget the children who have become scapegoats, seeing their innocent faces torn by rocket fragments in this war,” said Walid Asad, a 31-year-old mathematics teacher. “The United States and international community must carry out their humanitarian duty and prevent the regime and its allies from letting this happen again.”",world
"Hurricane Isaac -- one of three hurricanes churning in the Atlantic on Monday -- slowed and was downgraded to a tropical storm early Tuesday morning, when scientists recorded Isaac's wind speed at 70 mph.

Little to no change is expected in the next few days for the storm, which had become the 5th hurricane to form during the 2018 Atlantic season. Though Isaac was soon downgraded, it is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength as it approaches the Lesser Antilles, the National Hurricane Center said.

As of 5 a.m. Isaac was about 880 miles east of the Lesser Antilles and forecast to move across the islands and into the eastern Caribbean Sea on Thursday, the Miami-based center said.

"A senior Kosovo official said on Tuesday any agreement on normalizing relations with Serbia must include the country's recognition by Belgrade and its admission to the United Nations.

Deputy Prime Minister Enver Hoxhaj said during a conference in Slovenia that a ""very complex process"" lies ahead in the European Union-mediated negotiations that aim to solve a long standing dispute between the former war foes.

Serbia has refused to accept Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence that came after NATO intervened in the 1998-99 war to stop an onslaught by then-Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic against Kosovo ethnic Albanian separatists.

Around 100 countries have recognized Kosovo's statehood, including the United States and most EU nations. But Russia has backed Serbia's claim on Kosovo and blocked its entry into the U.N.

Hopes have been raised recently that a deal could be close after officials from Serbia and Kosovo suggested they could swap territories as part of the solution.

""We can sign a deal which includes Kosovo recognition, we cannot sign any other deal,"" Hoxhaj insisted. ""Solution for Kosovo (problem) is the Security Council in New York.""

Hoxhaj also criticized Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, a former ultranationalist who now says he wants to reach a lasting settlement with Kosovo. Hoxaj accused Vucic of ""glorifying"" Milosevic during last weekend's visit to Serb-populated regions in Kosovo.

Vucic there called in a keynote speech for peace and reconciliation with the Albanians in Kosovo but also angered Balkan neighbors when he referred to Milosevic's as ""great Serbian leader"" whose results were ""very poor.""

Hoxhaj said Vucic is ""the last man in Serbia whom we (would) trust but we are going to do everything to get a deal.""

"Voters in Sweden handed the ruling Social Democrats their worst result in decades Sunday, while the far-right Sweden Democrats were projected to become the third-largest party in Stockholm's parliament.

With almost all the ballots counted, the Social Democrats had emerged as the largest party but had just 28.3 percent of the vote, making it likely to lose a significant number of seats.

The Moderates party was next at 19.8 percent, followed by the Sweden Democrats at 17.6 percent. That's a 4.6 percent increase in their vote share from the last election, held in 2014.

Sunday's results make it unlikely that any party will have a majority of the 175 seats in the Riksdagen, Sweden's parliament. It could take weeks or months of coalition talks before the next government is formed.

Both the left-leaning bloc led by the Social Democrats and the center-right bloc have said they would refuse to consider the Sweden Democrats as a potential coalition partner.

Sunday's election was the first since the Swedish government in 2015 allowed 163,000 migrants into the Scandinavian country with a population of 10 million. The number was far lower than the asylum-seekers Germany accepted that year, but the highest per capita of any European nation.

The Sweden Democrats — led by Jimmie Akesson — worked to soften its neo-Nazi image while helping to break down longstanding taboos on what Swedes could say openly about immigration and integration without being shunned as racists.

The potential of a surge by the party had many Swedes worried about an erosion of the humanitarian values that have long been a foundation of their country's identity.

""This election is a referendum about our welfare,"" Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said. ""It's also about decency, about a decent democracy ... and not letting the Sweden Democrats, an extremist party, a racist party, get any influence in the government.""

At the party's rally on Saturday, Akesson strongly criticized Lofven's government for ""prioritizing"" the cause of immigrants over the needs of citizens.

""This government we have had now ... they have prioritised, during these four years, asylum-seekers,"" Akesson said, giving an exhaustive list of things he says the government has failed to do for Swedish society because of migrants.

"Iran's foreign minister sharply criticized President Donald Trump Wednesday for abusing the U.S. presidency of the Security Council this month by holding a meeting on Iran's international activities during the annual gathering of world leaders at the U.N. in late September.

Mohammad Javad Zarif was responding in a tweet to U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley's announcement Tuesday that Trump will chair a meeting to address ""violations of international law and general instability Iran sows throughout the entire Middle East region.""

She accused Iran of supporting terrorism and destabilizing activities in Lebanon, Yemen and Syria.

Zarif tweeted that Trump ""plans to abuse presidency of SC to divert a session — item devoted to Palestine for 70 yrs — to blame Iran for horrors US & clients have unleashed across M.E. (Middle East).""

He also accused Trump of violating a 2015 U.N. Security Council resolution, number 2231, that endorsed the Iran nuclear deal. The president withdrew the United States from the nuclear accord between Iran and six major powers in May.

Zarif said ""@realDonaldTrump is violating it & bullying others to do same.""

Under Security Council rules, Iran can speak at the Sept. 26 meeting that Trump will chair, but Zarif and Iran's U.N. Mission did not indicate whether it would participate. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani is scheduled to attend the General Assembly's ministerial session, along with Zarif.

The mission said in a press release that despite the fact that Iran is in compliance with all its nuclear obligations under the 2015 deal according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, ""the U.S. not only unilaterally and unlawfully withdrew from the accord, but also now openly invites all U.N. member states to either violate or ignore resolution 2231 or face punishment.""

The mission called Israel's occupation of Palestine ""the main cause of all conflicts in the Middle East"" and accused the U.S., Israel's most important supporter, of rendering the Security Council ""ineffective in discharging its duty to end the illegal occupation.""

Iran called the Sept. 26 council meeting ""a further attempt by the U.S. to divert attention away from Israeli brutalities and to remove the issue from the council agenda; however, such actions are doomed to fail.""

Answering U.S. criticism of ""the so-called destabilizing role of Iran in the region,"" the Iranian mission called the United States ""a menace to Middle Eastern security with its destabilizing, unilateralist policies and military interventions based on false claims.""

It pointed to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, its presence in Afghanistan, ""the illegal occupation"" of nearly one-third of Syria, and its part in the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iranian-backed Houthi Shiite rebels in Yemen, which has been accused of killing civilians.

The mission noted that Iran was in ""the forefront"" of defeating the Islamic State extremist group which it claimed was created and supported by the U.S. and its regional allies.",world
"A British tech sleuth believes he has found the wreckage of the missing MH370 plane on Google Maps.

Ian Wilson claims he has spotted the doomed jet, which vanished in 2014 with 239 people on board, lying in a high altitude area of the Cambodian jungle.

Images from Google Maps show the outline of a large plane – which could simply be an aircraft flying directly below the satellite which photographed it.

But video producer Ian is convinced of his findings and says he intends to visit the sight to solve one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history.

He told the Daily Star: ""Measuring the Google sighting, you're looking at around 69 meters, but there looks to be a gap between the tail and the back of the plane.

""It's just slightly bigger, but there's a gap that would probably account for that.""

MH370 went missing people en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.

In July this year, the Malaysian government released the findings of their investigation admitting they still do not know what happened to the passenger jet.

Despite millions of pounds being spent to find the plane, Ian believes he has uncovered the wreckage by spending “hours” searching online.

He said: “I was on there (Google Earth), a few hours here, a few hours there. If you added it up I spent hours searching for places a plane could have gone down.

""And in the end, as you can see the place where the plane is. It is literally the greenest, darkest part you can see.""

An attempt by NATO to incorporate the former Soviet republic of Georgia could trigger a new, ""horrible"" conflict, Russia's prime minister said Tuesday in a stern warning to the West marking 10 years since the Russia-Georgia war.

Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview with the Kommersant daily broadcast by Russian state television that NATO's plans to eventually offer membership to Georgia are ""absolutely irresponsible"" and a ""threat to peace.""

Medvedev was Russia's president during the August 2008 war, which erupted when Georgian troops tried unsuccessfully to regain control over the Moscow-backed breakaway province of South Ossetia and Russia sent troops that routed the Georgian military in five days of fighting.

The Russian army was poised to advance on the Georgian capital, but Medvedev rolled it back, accepting a truce mediated by the European Union.

After the war, Georgia entirely lost control of both South Ossetia and another separatist region, Abkhazia. Russia has strengthened its military presence in both regions and recognized them as independent states, but only a few countries have followed suit.

The European Union on Tuesday reiterated its ""firm support to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognized borders"" and lamented the Russian military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

In a show of support for Georgia, foreign ministers of Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, and a Cabinet member from Ukraine, visited Tbilisi Tuesday, urging Russia to withdraw its troops from Abkhazia and South Ossetia. ""Nowadays no country can change the borders of another country by force,"" said Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz.

Russian-Georgian relations have improved since the war, but the issue of the breakaway regions remains, preventing the full normalization of ties.

Medvedev warned that NATO's attempt to embrace Georgia could have catastrophic consequences.

""There is an unresolved territorial conflict ... and would they bring such a country into the military alliance?"" he said. ""Do they understand the possible implications? It could provoke a horrible conflict.""

Medvedev pointed to Moscow's recognition of independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and the Russian military bases there, saying that any attempt to change the status quo could lead to ""extremely grave consequences."" ''I hope that NATO's leadership will be smart enough not to take any steps in that direction,"" he said.

The Russian prime minister described NATO's eastward expansion as a major security threat to Russia.

""Whatever our colleagues from the alliance may say, NATO countries see Russia as a potential enemy,"" he said. ""We can't help getting worried when the circle around our country keeps narrowing as more and more countries join NATO. NATO's expansion clearly poses a threat to the Russian Federation.""",world
"President Trump continued his criticism of NATO Tuesday before he headed to Europe for a meeting of leaders of the 29-nation alliance Wednesday, trading barbed tweets with European Council President Donald Tusk. The testy exchange was further evidence that the president is right when he says that NATO – created in 1949 – has become obsolete.

The U.S. president understands one of the great cardinal rules of geopolitics that others seem to have forgotten: no alliance lasts forever. After almost 70 years, America and its NATO partners in Europe may be heading for a new relationship, while still remaining friends.

In an early morning tweet Tuesday, President Trump wrote: “Getting ready to leave for Europe. First meeting - NATO. The U.S. is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them. Not fair to the U.S. taxpayer. On top of that we lose $151 Billion on Trade with the European Union. Charge us big Tariffs (& Barriers)!”

And in another tweet President Trump wrote: “NATO countries must pay MORE, the United States must pay LESS. Very Unfair!”

Tusk responded with a tweet of his own: “Dear @realDonaldTrump. US doesn’t have and won’t have a better ally than EU. We spend on defense much more than Russia and as much as China. I hope you have no doubt this is an investment in our security, which cannot be said with confidence about Russian & Chinese spending.”

History teaches us obvious reasons for the breakup of alliances. Circumstances and threats change. One country’s mortal enemy one day could be the nation’s best friend the next. Just look back at World War II – our enemies Germany, Japan and Italy are our allies today. Our ally Russia (part of the Soviet Union back then) is our adversary.

There is only one constant when it comes to smart foreign policy. A nation seeks allies and partnership where it has common interests. Sometimes those alliances lose their value or importance over time and break up.

NATO was formed to defend against the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. But the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact died in 1991 – and NATO’s original mission died then as well. Soviet tanks are no longer primed to head into Europe to conquer our NATO partners. NATO is now a world-class military alliance looking for a mission.

China is the national security challenge of our time. Russia does not even come close.

To be clear, Moscow is certainly a dangerous adversary. Its occupation and annexation of Crimea – thanks to its growing military might – as well as brutal chemical weapons attacks on British soil prove a rogue Russia needs to be deterred and confronted if need be.

But today’s Russia is not the superpower threat that the Soviet Union was. Over the long-term, demographic issues, economic stagnation and questions of who succeeds Russian President Vladimir Putin clearly ensure Moscow is not the boogeyman it once was.

Russia’s economy is roughly the size of Italy. But thanks to a tremendous amount of natural resources (particularly oil and natural gas) that it can sell, along with a military inheritance from the Soviet Union – including a large nuclear arsenal – Russia clearly poses a real threat to Europe that can’t be wished away.

But as President Trump has pointed out, if Europe really wanted to defend itself – and all NATO nations spent 2 percent their gross domestic products on defense, as they are supposed to be doing in the next few years – Russia would be no match for the might of just Britain, France and Germany alone.

Add in the capabilities of all the other members of the alliance – with America playing a small role as well – and Putin would, at least in theory, have every incentive to play nice for as long as he stays in power.

Instead, we have a situation where many of Europe’s major powers have armed forces that can barely do anything anymore. Having focused on developing expensive social welfare programs that cost billions of dollars every year, Europe has instead outsourced its defense to the U.S. military and U.S. taxpayers.

This forces America to put vital resources into Europe that are sorely needed elsewhere – especially in Asia. Even having a military with a $700 billion annual budget that is the best in the world does not mean America can defend all our allies all over the world. They have a responsibility to pay their fair share for their own defense and fill the ranks of their own armed forces, as President Trump has repeatedly pointed out.

America’s power and might must be focused on the greatest of all threats, with our partners and friends taking on the burden in other areas of the world that are closer to their doorstep.

With Chinese economic and military power on the rise, the U.S. must concentrate its efforts on the rising Asian superpower that seeks to overthrow the international order in the Asia-Pacific and turn large sections of the sea into its own sovereign territory. China is the national security challenge of our time . Russia does not even come close.

And then there is North Korea. As the world witnessed last weekend, Pyongyang will not be handing over its nuclear bombs anytime soon. Washington must focus as much of its diplomatic attention – and if need be, military might – on ensuring that we find a long-term solution to deal with North Korea. If we fail to do this, we are doomed to increased tensions like those that nearly brought East Asia to the brink of nuclear war last summer.

All this means that America’s available diplomatic and military bandwidth that it can devote to Europe must change. We must face up to the fact that NATO, in its present form, is obsolete. The alliance must evolve into an organization led and mostly resourced by Europeans.

So, is America going to quit NATO and go back across the Atlantic or abandon its allies in Europe? Never. Does that mean a wave of isolationism has infected Washington and we won’t honor our treaty commitments or push back against Moscow in another crisis? Not at all.

But it does mean a fundamental shift in burden that a Europe blessed with wealth and riches can easily maintain. However, if Europe is unwilling or unable to field a credible armed force to take on challenges from Russia or elsewhere, we must question the utility of an alliance that is a shell of what it used to be.

During World War I, the U.S. Army produced an iconic recruiting poster showing Uncle Sam pointing a finger at the viewer saying: “I WANT YOU FOR U.S. ARMY.” We could use a similar poster today for our NATO allies, saying: “I WANT YOU FOR YOUR OWN ARMIES.”

This is the message I expect President Trump will deliver in Europe. And it’s one our partners on the continent need to listen to.",world
"China is rolling out new rules on religious activity on the internet amid an ongoing crackdown on churches, mosques and other institutions by the officially atheist Communist Party.

Anyone wishing to provide religious instruction or similar services online must apply by name and be judged morally fit and politically reliable, according to draft regulations posted online late Monday by the State Administration for Religious Affairs.

Organizations and schools that receive licenses can operate only on their internal networks that require users to be registered and are barred from seeking converts or distributing texts or other religious materials, the rules said.

They also impose tight limits on what can be said or posted, including a ban on criticism of the party's leadership and official religious policies, promoting religious participation by minors, and ""using religion to ... overthrow the socialist system.""

Livestreaming of religious activities, including praying, preaching or even burning incense, is also forbidden.

Authorities in recent months have ratcheted up pressure on religious groups, destroying crosses, burning bibles, shutting churches and ordering followers to renounce their faith.

The campaign is part of a drive to ""Sinicize"" religion by demanding loyalty to the Communist Party and leader Xi Jinping. Observers call it the most severe crackdown since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982.

Chinese law requires religious believers to worship only in congregations registered with the authorities and bans most religious observance in private homes.

All of China's officially recognized religions appear to have been affected by the crackdown. In the northwestern region of Xinjiang, an estimated 1 million Uighurs and other members of Muslim minority groups have been arbitrarily detained in indoctrination camps where they are forced to denounce Islam and profess loyalty to the party.

The Latest on the unrest in Iraq (all times local):

5:30 p.m.

Iraqi security forces and troops are deploying in the center of Basra and on street intersections, after hundreds of protesters torched government buildings and set fire to the Iranian consulate.

Dozens of gun-mounted black pick-up trucks belonging to the Interior Ministry and carrying masked security forces in combat fatigues were seen deploying Saturday afternoon.

Troops in Humvees also deployed on street intersections in the city center.

The deployment came shortly after an alliance of Shiite militias vowed to respond to the violent protests that have gripped the city for the past week. Health officials say at least 15 people have been killed in the weeklong confrontations.

4:45 p.m.

The local military commander of an alliance of powerful Shiite militias is vowing to respond to weeklong protests that have turned violent in the southern city of Basra.

The commander, known as Abu Yasser al-Jaafar,i held a news conference in the city Saturday. ""We will have a response to those who are carrying out acts of arson and sabotage,"" he proclaimed.

Angry protesters have torched government buildings and offices belonging to powerful Iranian-backed militias in weeklong protests demanding improved services and an end to corruption.

Al-Jaafari said that the lack of a response thus far should not be taken as a sign of weakness. He spoke at the city's presidential palaces compound, where Shiite paramilitary troops are stationed.

The government-sanctioned alliance of Shiite militias is known as the ""Popular Mobilization Forces"" or ""Hashed"" in Arabic. Many of the militias are backed by Iran.

Assailants fired three Katyusha rockets at Iraq's Basra airport Saturday, an airport official said, after a chaotic and violent night that saw hundreds of protesters setting ablaze the Iranian consulate in the city, attacking offices belonging to Iranian-backed militias and blocking roads.

The city of Basra, home to some of the largest oil fields in Iraq, has been the epicenter of angry protests over decades of government neglect, poor services and corruption. The demonstrations are the most serious to shake the oil-rich southern Shiite area in years, demanding an end to endemic corruption, soaring joblessness and crumbling infrastructure.

"A torchlight parade in Pyongyang ended a government-orchestrated celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of North Korea.

Troops, tanks and guns were on display, but no long-range missiles capable of hitting the U.S. with a nuclear warhead as seen in past parades.

Instead, thousands of civilians marched and sang the praises of the country’s economy, peace and, of course, their leader Kim Jong Un.

“The parade sends a positive signal that Kim Jong Un is not showing off his nukes,” North Korea expert John Delury of Yonsei University told Fox News, “He’s not waving ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles) in everybody’s face. And that implicitly, he is still committed to the path of peace and denuclearization.”

Still, talks with the regime are badly stuck.

New reports Monday, backed by Fox News sources, claim North Korea continues to build nuclear weapons, maybe as many as eight this year, and could be concealing them.

Some here are not surprised: “North Koreans say they are going to surrender nuclear weapons,” North Korea expert Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University said, “I’m pretty sure they have not the slightest intention to surrender their nuclear weapons.”

North Korea is also adamant about the U.S. signing on to a declaration ending the Korean War.

The Trump administration wants action from the North first.

All of these issues should be addressed when Kim meets in a crucial summit in Pyongyang next week with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

His key advisor, Chung-in Moon, thinks the chemistry existing between Trump and Kim will overcome problems.

“Yes, we are in a stalemate,” Moon explained, “However, we have a great hope of overcoming the stalemate given the remarks and behavior of the two leaders, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un.”

Perhaps another sign of a potentially fruitful relationship is a letter Kim sent to Trump. The White House said it is an invitation to meet again, and the administration is “open” to the idea with the hope that words could turn into action.",world
"A Twitter account set up by members of Venezuela’s opposition has become a window into the opulent lives of the so-called “daughters of chavismo” — young women who grew up in privileged households owned by members of the socialist government and now continue enjoying the good life abroad.

In the past few weeks, VVsincensura has been posting photos provided by its followers showing family members of the political elite having a good time in their brand new car, eating in Paris or surfing in some exotic beach.

HUGO CHÁVEZ DAUGHTER IS THE RICHEST INDIVIDUAL IN VENEZUELA, REPORT CLAIMS

One of them is Lucia Rodriguez, daughter of hard-left mayor of Caracas and niece of the foreign minister, who actually started the trend by posting images of herself as a student at a private university in Sydney. This enraged many in the hyperinflationary country, where the population is struggling with accute shortages of food and medicine.

According to The Times of London, Rodriguez was tracked down by an opposition activist to Bondi Beach, where she was photographed surfing and sipping cocktails.

Other daughters of the Bolivarian Revolution exposed as leading lavish capitalist lifestyles are two teenage children of Defense Minister Vladimir ­Padrino Lopez, who are reportedly studying in Spain, and Daniella Cabello, a glamorous daughter of senior government adviser Diosdado Cabello, believed to be studying in Brazil.

OUTRAGED WITH SERIES ABOUT CHAVEZ'S LIFE, VENEZUELA PREZ ORDERS A REMAKE

A couple of weeks ago, a group of Venezuelans confronted Mayor Rodríguez’s daughter when they saw her walking in the Australian capital.

""People are dying because of your dad!"" the group shouted, as shown on a YouTube video that quickly went viral in Venezuela.

""Call your aunt and ask her where Leopoldo is!"" they also said, alluding to jailed opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez.

Rumors of extreme privilege also surround the two daughters of late President Hugo Chavez. Maria ­Gabriela, the eldest, is deputy ambassador to the UN in New York City and according to some in the opposition she is worth billions. Her sister ­Rosines Chavez is reportedly studying at the Sorbonne university in Paris.

A controversial cartoon of Serena Williams that has been widely condemned as a racist depiction of the tennis great has been partially reprinted on the front page of the Melbourne-based newspaper that initially published it.

The Herald Sun newspaper printed an edited portion of the cartoon — featuring 23-time Grand Slam winner Williams jumping on a broken racket during her dispute with a chair umpire in the U.S. Open final — among caricatures of other famous people Wednesday under the headline ""Welcome to the PC World.""

The newspaper has defended its cartoonist Michael Knight's depiction of Williams and is asserting the condemnation, which has come from all parts of the world, is driven by political correctness.

""If the self-appointed censors of Mark Knight get their way on his Serena Williams cartoon, our new politically correct life will be very dull indeed,"" the paper printed on its front page.

Williams has won the Australian Open singles title seven times at Melbourne Park, including 2017 when she was pregnant. She is a crowd favorite at the first tennis major of the year, which is held each January at a venue that is within sight of the Herald Sun's headquarters.

In comments published by News Corp., Knight said that he created the cartoon after watching Williams' ""tantrum"" during her U.S. Open final loss to Naomi Osaka on Saturday and that it was designed to illustrate ""her poor behavior on the day, not about race.""

Knight reportedly has disabled his Twitter account after his post of the cartoon attracted tens of thousands of comments, mostly critical.

During the final against Osaka, Williams got a warning from the chair umpire for violating a rarely enforced rule against receiving coaching from the sidelines. An indignant Williams emphatically defended herself, denying she had cheated. A short time later, she smashed her racket in frustration and was docked a point. She protested and demanded an apology from the umpire, who penalized her a game.

Critics of Knight's cartoon described it as a clear example of a stereotype facing black women, depicting Williams as an irate, hulking, big-mouthed black woman jumping up and down on a broken racket. The umpire was shown telling a blond, slender woman — meant to be Osaka, who is Japanese and Haitian — ""Can you just let her win?""

""I was deeply offended. This is not a joke,"" said Vanessa K. De Luca, former editor in chief of Essence magazine, who wrote a column about the U.S. Open furor.

The cartoonist ""completely missed the point of why she was upset,"" De Luca told The Associated Press. ""It was about her integrity, and anybody who doesn't get that is perpetuating the erasure that so many black women feel when they are trying to speak up for themselves. It's like our opinions don't matter.""

In a social media post, Peter Blunden, managing director of News Corp's operations in the state of Victoria, said: ""Australia's finest cartoonist Mark Knight has the strongest support of his colleagues for his depiction of Serena Williams' petulance. It's about bad behavior, certainly not race. The PC brigade are way off the mark ... again.""",world
"Senior U.S. officials warned the Russian and Syrian governments Tuesday against chemical weapons use in Syria as forces allied with its President Bashar Assad prepare for an offensive on a rebel stronghold.

The United States ""will respond to any verified chemical weapons use in Idlib or elsewhere in Syria ... in a swift and appropriate manner,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters in Washington.

Nauert said senior U.S. officials engaged with their Russian counterparts to ""to make this point very clear to Damascus."" She said the use of chemical weapons ""will not be tolerated.""

She said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last week that Moscow — a military ally of Assad — would be held responsible.

The Syrian government is gearing up for an expected offensive in Idlib province, which is home to nearly 3 million people and has a large al-Qaida presence in addition to Syrian rebel groups.

President Donald Trump has twice carried out airstrikes in Syria in response to apparent chemical weapons attacks there. Trump said the strikes were intended to deter Assad from launching chemical weapons attacks again.

At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis referred to those two airstrikes but offered no further information Tuesday on how the U.S. was responding to the situation, other than to cite the State Department's ""recent active communication with Russia to enlist them in preventing this.""

In April, the United States, France and Britain launched military strikes in Syria to punish Assad for an apparent attack using chlorine against civilians in the Damascus suburb of Douma. And in 2017 Trump authorized a barrage of Tomahawk cruise missiles to hit a single Syrian airfield in retaliation for Assad's use of sarin gas against civilians.

Assad has repeatedly denied his government has used chemical weapons.

Russia has accused Syrian rebels of preparing chemical attacks, which Moscow says the West will use to justify a strike against Syrian government forces.",world
"Police in Thailand have arrested 12 people who shared a Facebook post about a British tourist's allegation that police had refused to accept her rape complaint.

A lawyer for the 12 Thai men said Thursday they were arrested in several different provinces this week on charges of violating the Computer Crime Act. They could face up to five years in prison and fines if convicted of spreading false information and damaging national security.

Police deny turning away the British woman and say their investigation determined that her claim of being raped on the island of Koh Tao in June was untrue.

The Computer Crime Act has been used to prosecute people for posting about the country's monarchy or political issues but rarely for purely criminal cases.

The 19-year-old woman, who has since returned to England, has told journalists she believes she was drugged by someone who spiked her drink, and woke up on a beach to find that she had been raped and robbed.

""From our initial investigation, we concluded and reported to our police commissioner that at the moment there is no evidence or witnesses to prove that the incident has happened, not on a drug claim or a rape claim,"" Deputy Tourist Police chief Maj. Gen. Surachet Hakpan, head of the investigation, said at a news conference Thursday.

Koh Tao, though popular with foreign backpackers, has gained an unsavory reputation since the murders of British nationals Hannah Witheridge and David Miller, who were beaten to death on a beach there in 2014.

That case has been plagued with speculation that two migrant workers from Myanmar convicted and sentenced to death for the crime were scapegoats. Skeptics also point to several other unexplained tourist deaths on the island, suggesting that well-connected local residents have covered up deadly attacks.

The Computer Crime Act has been used to prosecute people for Facebook postings about the country's monarchy or political issues but rarely for purely criminal cases.

""These men just simply clicked share on a Facebook post. They have no intention of spreading false rumors or damaging the country. I can only assume that the police made such a quick arrest to stop people from sharing news on this case, which they see as bad for the tourism industry,"" said lawyer Winyat.

"A Syrian refugee living in Canada was arrested in the murder of a 13-year-old girl, who was found dead in a park last year just months after her alleged killer came to the country.

Ibrahim Ali, 28, was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Marrisa Shen, authorities announced Monday. Shen was reported missing July 19, 2017, and her body was discovered the next day in Burnaby’s central park, located about 7 miles south of Vancouver, CBC reported.

""We still believe this crime was a random act,"" Donna Richardson, superintendent with the Integrated Homicide Investigative Team, said during a news conference. ""As far as motive is concerned...I am not able to discuss these matters in order to protect future judicial procedures.""

Police did not reveal how Shen died, or if she was sexually assaulted.

Richardson said Ali came onto the radar of investigators about two weeks ago when new evidence emerged.

""I'm not going to say there was a key piece of evidence, it was culmination of a number of things,"" she said.

Ali has been living in Canada as a refugee for 18 months. He came to the country with other family members in March 2017, four months before Shen was found dead.

St. Andrew's-Wesley United Church in Vancouver had helped Ali through the private refugee sponsorship program, which allows groups or individuals to support refugees to come to the country, CBC reported. The group or individual agrees to provide assistance, such as housing, for the refugee.

The church’s lead minister, Dan Chambers, said in a statement to CBC News that the church is cooperating with police in the murder investigation.

"Is there future fame in Russia for the two men accused of poisoning a former spy in Britain?

The pair, who British authorities identify as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, broke their silence Thursday in an interview with the Kremlin-friendly Russia Today network, griping about the weather in Salisbury and claiming they never heard of Sergei Skripal before the incident in March that left Skirpal and his daughter critically injured.

Yet the last time Britain accused two Russians of an assassination, one of them, Andrei Lugovoi, astonishingly ended up in the Russian parliament. Other Russians accused of crimes abroad, such as spy Anna Chapman, also have found success since returning to their homeland.

The two men accused in the Skripal case already appear to have one key fan – Russian President Vladimir Putin, who on Wednesday urged the duo to come forward and tell their story.

""This would be best for everyone,” Putin was quoted by the BBC as saying. ""There is nothing special there, nothing criminal, I assure you. We'll see in the near future.”

As the Skripal case continues to unfold, here are other notable Russian figures who have received a warm welcome after getting in trouble abroad:

ANNA CHAPMAN

When the FBI rounded up 10 Russian sleeper agents in 2010 and sent them back home in a spy swap, one caught the eye of the tabloids – and she has kept her name in the media since.

The then-28-year-old Chapman, who was married to a British man, managed to launch a modeling career in Russia, and was briefly on the board of the youth arm of a pro-Putin political party.

The Associated Press reports that she is best known, however, as the host of “Chapman’s Secrets,” a long-running show mixing anti-American rhetoric with conspiracy theories and mysticism.

“Why does official science still not concede that unidentified flying objects are alien spaceships?” she said in one episode. “Our hypothesis that alien intelligence has long colluded with the ruling elite was recently and unexpectedly confirmed. What are politicians and soldiers keeping quiet about? I, Anna Chapman, will reveal this secret.”

More than 400 episodes of the show have been made. Last week, guests speculated the U.S. was training Eastern European guerrillas to invade Russia, and another guest — introduced as a shaman — suggested intelligent trees caused hikers to go missing out of spite for humanity.

“It’s incredible, but the living forest from the movie ‘Avatar’ isn’t the director’s make-believe,” Chapman summarized.

Chapman also made headlines in 2013 after tweeting ""[Edward] Snowden, will you marry me?"" to the notorious National Security Agency leaker, who fled the U.S. and now lives in Russia.

She also ripped the West this summer as Russia hosted the 2018 World Cup.

“I would like to thank FIFA for this amazing experience [and] all foreigners for coming to Russia,” Chapman said. “We loved having you and [definitely] gonna miss the vibe. You turned our country into a place of celebration, happiness and land of sport lovers.”

Chapman added World Cup fans got to see what Russia truly is like, despite “the propaganda efforts from the West.”

She marked another, more personal, milestone in July: The eighth anniversary of her release from a New York jail. She called the occasion her ""second birthday.""

ANDREI LUGOVOI

Accused of poisoning and killing ex-KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 with radioactive tea in London, Lugovoi, a former KGB officer, parlayed his newfound fame into a political career. In 2007, he was elected to parliament on the ticket of the nationalist LDPR party, which has strong Kremlin ties.

The switch to serving in government has also been a safeguard for Lugovoi, as the Russian constitution bans extraditing criminal suspects. Lugovoi’s status as a lawmaker makes him immune from prosecution at home, according to the Associated Press.

While in office, Lugovoi has also lent his name to the Lugovoi Law — a 2014 measure allowing authorities to block “extremist” websites without a court ruling — and he’s a regular commentator on state TV regarding the Skripal case.

He has long maintained his innocence in the Litvinenko poisoning, and in 2016 called the accusations “absurd.""

""The results of the inquiry made public today once again confirm London's anti-Russian stance, tunnel thinking and the unwillingness of the British to establish the true cause of Litvinenko's death,” he was quoted by the AFP as saying at the time.

Lugovoi has also argued that Skripal’s poisoning had nothing to do with Russia and blames Britain for harboring people he calls defectors.

“As long as you keep welcoming all kinds of scum on your territory, you’re going to keep having problems,” he said in March on a popular talk show.

MARIA BUTINA

Accused of working as an undeclared foreign agent in the U.S., Butina is quickly becoming a cause celebre at home.

She was a relatively obscure gun-rights activist in Russia before she started making political contacts among Republicans and National Rifle Association members in the U.S. Now, Butina’s photo is the avatar on the Russian Foreign Ministry’s social media profiles.

“#FreeMariaButina” reads a hashtag next to her face in the account’s profile picture.

Government rhetoric portrays her as a martyr to U.S. paranoia and a victim of poor conditions in the Washington, D.C., jail where she’s being held pending trial.

Russian ombudsperson Tatiana Moskalkova, in an interview with the TASS news agency in late August, claimed Butina's treatment was ""inhumane and degrading.”

She said Butina ""was subjected to a degrading inspection, made to undress, transferred in chains without warning or explanation, placed into quarantine, where she spent 12 hours with no food or light, and now she is in solitary confinement.""

"Pro-Beijing scholars brought together by the Chinese government have briskly defended the country's human rights record as criticism grows over the mass internment of ethnic minority Muslim Uighurs in China's far west.

In a move indicative of a new public relations push, Chinese officials for the first time hosted journalists to meet with the academics on the sidelines of a U.N.-backed Human Rights Council session in Geneva.

China has faced mounting criticism over a massive security clampdown targeting Uighurs native to China's Xinjiang region. The new U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, this week said monitors should be allowed into the region, and calls have been made in the U.S. Congress for sanctions on some Chinese officials.

Li Xiaojun, director of publicity at the State Council Information Office, touted Beijing's record, berated alleged failures in the West to counter violence by Islamic extremists and denied any injustices against Uighurs.

""It's not mistreatment, and it's the correct thing to do for the Chinese government,"" he said. ""Maybe it's the necessary way to deal with Islamic or religious extremism, because the West has failed in doing so.""

""Look at Belgium, look at Paris, look at some other European countries,"" Li added. ""These countries did not deal with religious extremism very well ... actually they are doing that very bad.""

He said his government is placing some people in training centers, insisting they are different from detention centers/

""China wants to seriously to deal with Islamic extremism. It wants to prevent that from spreading to the common people, to the common Muslims in Xinjiang,"" Li said.

A number of news organizations, including The Associated Press, have reported on new indoctrination camps in far western China, where detainees have had to disavow their Islamic beliefs, criticize themselves and their loved ones and give thanks to the ruling Communist Party.

On Thursday, the academics chimed in variously to hail the alleged effectiveness of China's centralized, one-party state, or insist China's approach to human rights is grounded in the fight against poverty and that efforts will proceed ""step-by-step.""

Asked whether they had criticisms of the government's human rights policies, none offered any.

"A U.S. State Department official offered ""heartfelt and profound"" support to Macedonia Thursday ahead of a key referendum on changing its name that could clear the way for the former Yugoslav republic's NATO accession.

Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Wess Mitchell — the latest in a line of Western officials visiting Skopje to back the process — said the final decision in the Sept. 30 referendum lies with Macedonians.

""But America also has a stake in the western Balkans, of seeing stability and prosperity in a very import region,"" Mitchell added after talks with Macedonian Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov in Skopje.

Western governments are particularly keen to get the tiny landlocked country into NATO, as that would expand the alliance's presence in the Balkans and diminish Russian influence.

European Union foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini will be also visiting Skopje later Thursday, while U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is expected on Monday.

The referendum will seek approval of a June agreement with Greece to rename Macedonia ""North Macedonia."" That would end a bitter 27-year dispute between the two Balkan neighbors, and end Greek objections to the country joining NATO and the EU.

Greece argues that Macedonia's current name implies claims on its own adjoining province of Macedonia, and on ancient Greek culture. Macedonia denies that.

Macedonia's center-left prime minister, Zoran Zaev, spoke at the European Parliament earlier Thursday and said his country is ready to grasp its ""historic moment"" and change its name.

At a Pentagon briefing earlier this week, Defense Secretary Mattis told reporters he was concerned about alleged acts of ""mischief"" by Russia to try to block Macedonia's path to NATO membership.

Philippine authorities began evacuating thousands of people Thursday in the path of the most powerful typhoon this year, closing schools, readying bulldozers for landslides and placing rescuers and troops on full alert in the country's north.

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii categorized the storm as a super typhoon with powerful winds and gusts.

Forecasters said Typhoon Mangkhut could hit northeastern Cagayan province on Saturday. It was tracked on Thursday about 725 kilometers (450 miles) away in the Pacific with sustained winds of 205 kilometers (127 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 255 kph (158 mph), they said.

With a massive raincloud band 900 kilometers (560 miles) wide, combined with seasonal monsoon rains, the typhoon could bring heavy to intense rains that could set off landslides and flash floods, government forecasters said. Storm warnings have been raised in 25 provinces on the main northern island of Luzon, restricting sea travel.

Office of Civil Defense chief Ricardo Jalad said more than 4 million people in the northeastern provinces of Cagayan and Isabela and outlying provincial regions are vulnerable to the most destructive effects near the typhoon's 125-kilometer (77-mile) -wide eye. Nearly 48,000 houses in those high-risk areas are made of light materials and vulnerable to Mangkhut's ferocious winds.

Cagayan Gov. Manuel Mamba said by telephone that evacuations of residents from risky coastal villages and island municipalities north of the rice-and corn-producing province of 1.2 million people have started and classes at all levels have been canceled.

""The weather here is still good but we're moving them now because it's very important that when it comes, people will be away from peril,"" Mamba said.

The typhoon was slightly changing its track, Mamba said, adding that authorities needed to rapidly reassess where to redeploy emergency teams and supplies.

The typhoon is approaching at the start of the rice and corn harvesting season in Cagayan, a major agricultural producer, and farmers were scrambling to save what they could of their crops, Mamba said. The threat to agriculture comes as the Philippines tries to cope with rice shortages.

The Office of Civil Defense said other northern provinces also started evacuating residents Thursday from high-risk areas, including in northern mountain provinces prone to rain and mudslides. Residents covered glass windows with wood, strengthened houses with rope and wooden braces and moved fishing boats to safety.

President Rodrigo Duterte canceled his appearance at a missile test firing aboard a navy ship off northern Bataan province due to the approaching typhoon and instead led a meeting with disaster-response agencies and defense officials in Manila.

On Guam, where Mangkhut has passed, residents woke up Tuesday to flooded streets, downed trees and widespread power outages. Government agencies were conducting damage assessments and beginning to clear roads, according to the Pacific Daily News.

About 80 percent of the U.S. territory was without power but it was restored by Thursday morning.

Mangkhut, a Thai word for mangosteen, is the 15th storm this year to batter the Philippines, which is hit by about 20 a year and is considered one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. Typhoon Haiyan left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and displaced over 5 million in the central Philippines in 2013.",world
"The Latest on developments in Syria (all times local):

2:40

The United Nations says over 30,000 people have been displaced in nearly two weeks of escalation in attacks on Syria's last rebel bastion in the country's northwest.

The escalation in aerial bombing and shelling of the rebel areas in Idlib and northern Hama have set off alarm bells. The U.N. has warned against a threatened government offensive, which it said could displace as many as 800,000, of which only 100,000 may flee to government-controlled areas, according to the U.N.

Idlib and surrounding areas are home to nearly 3 million people, half of them already displaced by violence in different parts of Syria.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement late Wednesday that 38,300 were displaced by the violence since Sept. 1, most of them heading toward the Turkish-Syrian borders to already overcrowded displaced persons camps.

Some 4,500 — or 11 percent — returned home spontaneously in the last two days as the violence decreased.

"President Donald Trump's assertion that the federal government's response to Hurricane Maria was ""an incredible, unsung success"" fell flat in Puerto Rico, where islanders are still struggling to recover from the devastating storm a year later.

""I was indignant,"" said Gloria Rosado, a 62-year-old college professor who watched the president's news conference on TV late Tuesday from San Juan and was still fuming the next day. ""The image of my dead husband immediately came to my mind ... as well as all the lives that were lost.""

Rosado's husband, who was hospitalized for respiratory and renal complications and ultimately suffered a heart attack, was one of the estimated 2,975 people who died in the Category 4 storm's aftermath when medical resources were strained beyond the breaking point.

For many, Trump's boast about ""one of the best jobs that's ever been done"" was hard to square with their daily reality: Blackouts remain common; nearly 60,000 homes are covered by only a makeshift roof not capable of withstanding a Category 1 hurricane; and 13 percent of municipalities lack stable phone or internet service.

""Federal response according to Trump in Puerto Rico a success?"" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz said in one of a series of tweets. ""If he thinks the death of 3,000 people (is) a success God help us all.""

That reignited a longstanding feud between the mayor and Trump, who fired back calling her ""totally incompetent"" and saying the U.S. government ""did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico.""

A July report by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, noted several shortcomings in its response, including that it underestimated how much food and water would be needed after the storm and that not enough Spanish-speaking aid workers were deployed to the island.

At the same time, the agency also faced challenges that were arguably beyond its control such as the sheer force of the monster storm and the logistical difficulties of reaching the Caribbean island over a thousand miles (1,600 kilometers) away from the mainland.

And many residents say local officials share much of the blame. Puerto Rico's government has acknowledged that its emergency plans were designed for a Category 1 hurricane, as well as failures to follow those plans and communications breakdowns.

Ramon Ruiz, a 56-year-old business owner whose father died from heart problems on Thanksgiving after riding out the hurricane alone at home, pressed up against the door to keep it from caving in, is among those who say both local and federal authorities were slow to act.

""If it wasn't for the churches and private organizations, we truly would not have received help from anyone,"" Ruiz said. ""They are treating us like second-class citizens. ... If we were another state, the response would have been much faster.""

In Maria's aftermath, according to FEMA data analyzed by the AP, approvals for individual assistance checks in Puerto Rico were slower compared with for other large storms last year. From Sept. 30 to Oct. 7, not one of those checks was approved. On Oct. 8 the approvals began rolling again, but with a large spike suggesting a backlog.

In addition, data from the U.S. Small Business Administration indicate that approvals for disaster loans in Puerto Rico were slow — the first one was not approved until 15 days after the storm was declared, four times as long as with Hurricane Harvey.

For Maria, there was a large gap between when the first loan was approved and when loans started ramping up. While 25 percent of Harvey loans were OKed within 42 days, for Maria, that didn't happen until Jan. 9, more than three months after the storm hit.

Overall, compared with Harvey and Irma, Maria saw more funds loaned to homeowners rather than business owners.

Islanders have also been angered by recent discoveries of supplies that never got delivered. A photo that emerged Tuesday of thousands of water bottles abandoned on a runway in eastern Puerto Rico prompted local officials to say Wednesday that they were opening an investigation.

Ottmar Chavez, the new secretary of the island's General Services Administration, said at a news conference that Puerto Rican officials requested the water from the U.S. government and were supposed to pick it up in late May. He said some of it was distributed but people complained that it smelled bad. He added that it was unclear why the remainder sat on the runway for nearly four months.

Shortly after Maria hit last year, Trump visited Puerto Rico and was widely criticized for tossing paper towels to storm victims in a manner seen by many as insensitive to the scope of the disaster.

His latest remarks once again dredged up those same hurt feelings.

""I ignore them because none of them make sense,"" said Michelle Cruz, a 48-year-old airline worker whose mother died in December from septicemia after contracting an infection in a hospital during surgery after Maria. ""It bothers me and it hurts. But I don't pay attention to him.""

Data journalist Angeliki Kastanis reported from Los Angeles.",world
"A former security aide to French President Emmanuel Macron who set off a political scandal after being videotaped beating up a protester said Wednesday that he will appear before a Senate inquiry commission as requested — but only because he has no choice.

But Alexandre Benalla got off on a bad foot with senators who will question him, likely in a week, telling France-Inter radio Tuesday night that the commission members are ""little people"" for whom ""I have no respect.""

The commission, which resumed hearings on Wednesday after a summer break, wants to understand the nature of Benalla's job at the presidential Elysee Palace, which gave him perks and let him carry a gun, as well as uncover eventual malfunctions in the office of top aides and the security details protecting the president.

Benalla, 27, was placed under investigation shortly after the newspaper Le Monde identified him on July 18 as the man in the videotape posted online who was beating a protester at a May Day march, which had turned violent. He was fired amid a public outcry.

The ongoing judicial process puts any questions directly related to May Day off-limits.

Benalla had initially refused to appear before the Senate panel, but told BFMTV he will ""grudgingly"" go before the commission after its chief, Philippe Bas, made clear that failure to do so can result in jail and fines.

Benalla called Bas a ""little marquis"" in the interview with France-Inter, which said he was extremely agitated. He asked that his voice not be aired.

From the start of the scandal, questions have centered on the boundaries of Benalla's role at the Elysee and his influence and weight among police inside and outside the presidential palace. He served as Macron's bodyguard during the presidential campaign, but had no clear title in his new job, in which he helped organize outings, often accompanying Macron.

That his initial punishment for being violent at the protest was only two weeks suspension raised more questions — as did his appearance at special outings by Macron during that time.

""His behavior was reprehensible,"" Benalla's direct boss, Francois-Xavier Lauch, told the commission Wednesday, referring to the violent May Day incident. However, like others close to Benalla professionally, he praised his work on the job.",world
"The Philippine Navy extricated one of its largest warships which ran aground in a shoal near a hotly disputed region in the South China Sea.

Two Philippine security officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday that tugboats were used to pull the BRP Gregorio del Pilar from the shallow fringes of Half Moon Shoal, which the Philippines calls Hasa Hasa, before midnight.

The frigate, which was being towed back to a Philippine port, ran aground during a routine patrol Wednesday night, damaging some of its propellers. It's more than 100 crewmen were unhurt.

The barren shoal is on the eastern edge of the disputed Spratly archipelago, where tensions have run high in recent years after China transformed seven disputed reefs into islands and reportedly installed missile defense systems.

Philippine defense officials notified their Chinese counterparts after the accidental grounding of the Philippine Navy frigate at the shoal, which Beijing claims, to avoid any misunderstanding, said the two Philippine officials, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said last week that China offered to help but that the Philippines would handle it.

A Chinese frigate ran aground on the shoal in 2012 and was pulled away by Chinese military ships.

Half Moon Shoal lies about 110 kilometers (68 miles) from the southern tip of the western Philippine island of Palawan and south of the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, where a Philippine navy transport ship was intentionally grounded in 1999 and has since served as a Philippine military outpost.

China has repeatedly demanded the removal of the now rusty BRP Sierra Madre from Second Thomas Shoal, which is claimed by the Philippines and China.

A military report seen by the AP said the propellers of the BRP Gregorio del Pilar were damaged by the grounding. The crew checked the frigate after it ran aground and reported that it was not taking in water.

At least four Philippine Navy and Coast Guard ships were deployed to secure the BRP Gregorio del Pilar and provide food and other supplies to its sailors. Tugboats were hired to extricate the ship, military spokesman Col. Noel Detoyato said.

The frigate is one of three former U.S. Coast Guard cutters, which were acquired by the Philippine military, and are the Philippines' largest warships.

The United States and Asian governments which have claims in the disputed sea, including the Philippines, have raised alarms over China's island building and militarization of the strategic territory.

The Philippines has been one of the most vocal critics of China's assertive moves in the disputed waters. In 2016, it largely won a complaint it lodged before an international tribunal, which invalidated Beijing's sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, however, took steps to revive once-frosty ties with China after he took office in 2016 as he sought infrastructure funding and more trade and investment from Beijing.",world

A top adviser to Iran's president on human rights said that the government ""failed"" to help a U.S. permanent resident imprisoned over spying allegations that she herself invited to the country for a summit.

In a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, Shahindokht Molaverdi acknowledged the limits a civilian government faces when challenging the actions of the judiciary in the Islamic Republic, especially when dealing with cases involving the imprisonment of foreigners and activists.

She cited the case of Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese-born internet freedom advocate living in the U.S., who she invited to a conference in September 2015. The hard-line Revolutionary Guard later arrested Zakka on his way to the airport, and he was later sentenced to 10 years in prison on spying charges in a closed-door trial before a Revolutionary Court.

""This is in no way approved by the government,"" Molaverdi said. ""We did all we could to stop this from happening, but we are seeing that we have failed to make a significant impact.""

Molaverdi is an outspoken official within the government of elected President Hassan Rouhani, a relatively moderate cleric within Iran's Shiite theocracy. In Rouhani's first term, she served as his vice president for women and family affairs, and in his second term become his special assistant on citizenship rights.

Political analysts within Iran saw Molaverdi's reassignment as Rouhani responding to hard-liners' criticism of her comments on women's rights and other issues.

She's condemned police overreach in dealing with women loosely wearing their mandatory headscarves and demanded access for women to sporting events. She gave an interview in 2016 in which she said all the men in a single, unnamed village in Iran's eastern Sistan and Baluchistan province had been executed for drug offenses.

Molaverdi said she has friends working on women's rights issues who have been arrested by Iranian security forces. She blamed a ""complete miscoordination"" between Iran's civilian government and its judiciary, which like its state media and security forces is believed to be controlled by hard-liners.

""Actions by one branch can ignore or neutralize efforts by another branch,"" she said. ""This is an art and a very delicate job and sometimes the situation gets out of our hands, but anyway the goal of all of us is to stop this from happening and to minimize this.""

Iran's executive branch under both hard-liners and more-moderate presidents has had difficulty freeing prisoners, especially foreigners. That can happen both from the hard-line judiciary exerting its power and disputes between Iran's Intelligence Ministry, answerable to the president, and the county's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, answerable only the supreme leader.

""The executive branch is clearly aware of the limitations it operates under and will pick its battles with the judiciary carefully,"" said Ellie Geranmayeh, deputy director of the Middle East program at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Zakka's appears to be one of the cases where it got out of hand.

Zakka lives in Washington and holds permanent resident status in the U.S. He leads the Arab ICT Organization, or IJMA3, an industry consortium from 13 countries that advocates for information technology in the region.

It's unclear what prompted Iranian authorities to detain Zakka, though Iran in the past has used prisoners with Western ties as bargaining chips in negotiations.

The AP reported in May 2016 that Zakka's IJMA3 organization had received at least $730,000 in contracts and grants since 2009 from both the State Department and USAID, the lead American government agency fighting poverty and promoting democracy across the world.

Zakka's supporters say he traveled to Iran ""with the knowledge and approval"" of the State Department, something the AP has been unable to confirm.

Molaverdi acknowledged being the Iranian official who granted him permission to enter the country and remembered eating dinner with him at a conference and posing for a group photograph.

""I was later informed that he didn't go back to his country and on his way to the airport he had been arrested,"" she said. ""He's still in prison and a heavy sentence has been issued against him.""

She added: ""Such incidents definitely harm how Iran's domestic security is viewed from the outside for investment, although in reality it is not like that, but a false image is presented of our country.""

Jason Poblete, a Washington-based lawyer representing Zakka, said that while he appreciated Molaverdi's comments, they didn't change the fact ""Nizar was kidnapped and thrown in jail, not treated as a guest.""

""While a welcome sign that you seem to agree with Nizar that he was falsely accused, Nizar is going on three years in Evin"" prison, Poblete told the AP. ""This injustice has caused great and some unspeakable stresses on Nizar and his family. There are humanitarian and other grounds for Nizar's release and all the parties in interest — they know who they are — need to work expeditiously to right this injustice.""

Molaverdi acknowledged a recent spate of arrests of lawyers working on human rights issues, something criticized by Amnesty International as an ""intensifying crackdown on civil society."" She also said Rouhani's government was working to help release imprisoned students and so-called ""starred"" students — those blocked by security agencies from attending classes.

Asked about nationwide demonstrations in December and January sparked by Iran's economic woes that saw thousands arrested, Molaverdi stressed there was a difference between protests and ""rioting.""

Still, Molaverdi said change was possible and even necessary in Iran some 40 years after its Islamic Revolution.

""If we rethink our experiences, definitely, we'll come to the conclusion that we have other options available that are more effective,"" she said.

"Authorities in the coastal city of New Bern, N.C., were working with federal responders to rescue at least 150 residents who reported themselves stranded in Hurricane Florence's storm surge.

Colleen Roberts, public information officer for the city of about 30,000 residents, told Fox News that 200 people had been rescued so far as the Category 1 storm battered the area with strong winds and a life-threatening surge.

FEMA teams were employing boats in the rescues and were determining which cases were the most severe. Roberts said many of the residents live near the Neuse and Trent rivers.

Flooding and a strong storm surge prompted more than 90 calls to the emergency operation center in Craven County, N.C., for residents trapped in vehicles and homes, spokeswoman Amber Parker said.

Response teams had already “brought in busloads” of rescued people from areas including Fairfield Harbor, New Bern, Adams Creek and Township 7, she said.

Four shelters were currently open, Roberts said, adding that dispatchers received a call for 17 people stranded all on one street.

The storm was about 35 miles east of Wilmington, N.C., and about 50 miles southwest of Morehead City, N.C., the National Hurricane Center's 2 a.m. EDT Friday advisory said.

Hurricane-force winds extended 80 miles from its center, and tropical-storm-force winds up to 195 miles.

The storm is likely to bring significant rain to the Carolinas, where some places could see upwards of 20 inches, the update said. This is expected to cause ""catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding.""

"Thousands of Boston-area residents forced to evacuate their neighborhoods after Thursday's gas explosions and fires had “no clear timeline” on when they could return, officials said.

The explosions, which killed at least one person, leveled a number of homes and set off as many as 70 fires, affecting residents of Lawrence, North Andover and Andover, communities in the Merrimack Valley north of Boston, the Massachusetts State Police said.

At least 20 people were injured, FOX station Boston 25 reported.

Andover resident Don Bradley told Boston’s WBZ-TV that upon hearing the news of gas explosions he immediately evacuated his home, but had to convince his “millennial” son, who wanted to grab his iPad and Macbook, to leave the devices behind.

“It’s a gas explosion, we’re going. We’ve got to go. This is not negotiable.” - Don Bradley, Andover resident, recalling a conversation with his son

“It’s a gas explosion, we’re going,” Bradley said he told his son. “We’ve got to go. This is not negotiable.”

Manuel Cabrera told the Boston Globe he was forced to shelter at an elementary school with other residents.

“I probably would have found another place to wait it out, but they shut off the power in the city,” he said. “Hopefully, we’ll all be able to go home soon.”

The three affected communities total more than 146,000 residents about 26 miles north of Boston, near the New Hampshire border. Lawrence, the largest of them, is a majority Latino city with a population of about 80,000.

Volunteer firefighters and residents equipped with monkey wrenches were reportedly going from house to house shutting off gas lines to prevent more explosions and fires.

As fires raged, some neighborhoods were filled with heavy smoke and fleeing residents.

""It looked like Armageddon, it really did,"" Andover Fire Chief Michael Mansfield told reporters. ""There were billows of smoke coming from Lawrence behind me. I could see pillars of smoke in front of me from the town of Andover.""

Andrew Flanagan, town manager of Andover, where firefighters responded to 38 fires, told Springfield-based newspaper the Republican that “there is no clear timeline” on when evacuated residents could go back to their homes.

“We're going through a process with the utility identifying which areas of town that this most impacted in order to provide and accurate timeline of when people may be able to return to their homes,” Flanagan told Boston’s WFXT-TV.

Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera told the station that there was no expectation that people would be able to return to their homes Thursday.

""Some explosion took place about two streets down from where I live, so this is affecting me personally because my entire neighborhood now has been evacuated,"" Lawrence City Councilor Marc LaPlante told the station.

Columbia Gas, the utility that serves the communities, said earlier in the day that it would be ""improving natural gas service"" in the area, but was unclear on when and where the work would begin, MassLive reported.

After the explosions occurred, the utility issued the following statement:

“Columbia Gas crews are currently responding to reports of multiple fires in Lawrence. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by today’s incident.

“The first priority for our crews at the scene is to ensure the safety of our customers and the community by supporting first responders and completing safety checks on our system and in the surrounding area.

“We appreciate the response of local emergency responders and their coordination with our teams.

The company told customers that if they smell natural gas, to immediately leave the area and call 911 and their emergency number: 1-800-525-8222.

It also listed measures customers should take if they smell natural gas.

""Don’t turn off gas to your house or to any appliances,"" the statement said. ""Don’t try to find the leak yourself or operate pipeline valves; don’t light a match or candle, or operate anything that could cause a spark, including home phones or cell phones, lights, appliances, flashlights, power tools, etc; and don’t open the windows and doors in an attempt to ventilate.""

Gas service was shut down by the company to roughly 8,000 customers.

"When three Americans newly freed from detention in North Korea arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland early Thursday, President Donald Trump was there to greet them.

The president was joined by first lady Melania Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

A motorcade was waiting to take the three Korean-American detainees -- Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song and Tony Kim -- to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for physical examinations.

The White House said earlier they would be evaluated and receive medical treatment at the Washington-area facility. Their families were not on hand for the ceremony.

When the plane arrived from Alaska, where it stopped Wednesday after leaving North Korea, Trump and the first lady climbed aboard to greet the men and stayed there for several minutes.

After the president emerged with the three Americans, he addressed the media, saying, ""I really think he [Kim Jong Un] wants to do something.""

Trump publicly thanked North Korean ruler for releasing the prisoners, and regarded it as a sign of easing tensions as the two leaders hope to strike a deal toward peace on the Korean Peninsula in the forthcoming summit.

North Korea’s official news agency, KCNA, said Kim’s move to grant the three Americans amnesty came at the “official suggestion” of the U.S. president.

The former ""hostages,"" as Trump has called them, left North Korea early Wednesday, accompanied by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

""This is a special night for these three really great people,"" Trump told reporters as he stood on the tarmac. On the U.S. relationship with North Korea, Trump said, ""We're starting off on a new footing.""

The freed prisoners appeared tired but in excellent spirits, flashing peace signs as they emerged from the aircraft. They were joined by a translator who said ""it's like a dream"" and that the men were ""very, very happy"" to be freed.

North Korea had accused the detainees of anti-state activities. Their arrests were widely seen as politically motivated and compounded the dire state of U.S.-North Korea relations over the isolated nation’s nuclear weapons.

The three had been held for periods ranging between one and two years. They were the latest in a series of Americans who have been detained in North Korea in recent years for seemingly minor offenses.

“We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the people of the United States for bringing us home,” the three said in an earlier statement released by the State Department.

The three Americans and Pompeo flew on separate government planes because they received checkups during the flight from Japan and the larger plane was better equipped to accommodate the medical equipment.

Trump called it a “great honor” to welcome home the three North Korean detainees, but said ""the true honor is going to be if we have a victory in getting rid of nuclear weapons.""

Although few details have been revealed regarding the high-stakes foreign policy effort between Trump and Kim, Singapore has emerged as the likely host of the summit that will take place later this month or early June as the president sets his sights on denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.

Trump made a point of publicly thanking North Korea's leader for the prisoners' release — ""We want to thank Kim Jong Un"" — and hailed it as a sign of cooling tensions and growing opportunity on the Korean peninsula. Kim decided to grant amnesty to the three Americans at the ""official suggestion"" of the U.S. president, said North Korea's official news agency, KCNA.

"The first of the 10 people mowed down Monday in Toronto by a crazed driver was identified on Tuesday morning as a young woman who worked in investment management and was standing near her office when the rampage began.

Alek Minassian, 25, the driver in the van attack, was charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder in a brief court appearance Tuesday.



Anne Marie D’Amico was the first of the 10 victims killed in the attack, CBC reported. Described by her colleagues as a woman who was ""full of life,"" D'Amico was an employee at Invesco, a U.S.-based investment management firm whose Canadian headquarters is on Yonge Street, near the scene of the assault.

Peter Intraligi, president of Invesco Canada, confirmed D'Amico's death.

""Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all those impacted by this tragic event,"" Intraligi said. ""I can now confirm that unfortunately one of our employees has succumbed to her injuries. Out of respect for her and her family, we will not be providing any further comments.""

A company report from July 2017 stated a person with the same name as D'Amico was a performance management analyst who worked on a humanitarian project, Global News reported.

“What I didn’t expect was to have such a deep connection to the family and see first-hand how much this new home truly means to them,” D’Amico stated in the report.

""[She was] full of life, loved to travel, loved to help volunteer,"" Jon Tam, who worked with D'Amico, told CBC.

""She was a very warm, friendly presence in the office. Always smiling,"" he added. ""I'll definitely be missing seeing that smile around the office.""

Police have yet to release all the names of those who were killed or the 15 people who were injured.

Minassian intentionally plowed his vehicle into the crowd of pedestrians just before 1:30 p.m., leaving a trail of chaos, cops said. Minassian, who lives in the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill, was taken into custody after a brief confrontation with officers a few blocks away from the initial crime scene.

""The incident definitely looked deliberate,"" Police Chief Mark Saunders told reporters at a late-night news conference.

Photos and videos from where the van jumped the sidewalk showed blood and bodies. Henry Yang, who witnessed the attack, told the Toronto Star he was in his car when he saw the van “flying” down the street and smashing into anything in its way.

“He was driving southbound and most of the pedestrians were walking southbound, so they didn’t see him coming,” Yang recalled to the Toronto Star. “I started honking my horn, making noises, trying to make a commotion, trying to make people aware that something was going on. I rolled down my windows and started yelling at people, I wanted them to get out of the way.”

Saunders said Monday night authorities are still piecing together information. Police had initially said nine people were killed, but Saunders confirmed one more died at the hospital.

Authorities also have not ruled out terror as a possible motive in the van attack.

The Russian Orthodox Church on Friday announced a rebuff to the leader of the worldwide Orthodox community, saying it would not participate in events headed by the Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarchate due to a dispute over control of the church in Ukraine.

The church also announced at a meeting of top priests that it would not even remember Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I in its prayers.

The meeting was called in order to respond to the Ecumenical Patriarchate's decision last week to allow the Orthodox Church in Ukraine to be autocephalous — ecclesiastically independent. The Russian church, the world's largest Orthodox communion, fiercely opposes the decision.

Church spokesman Metropolitan Ilarion insisted that Friday's response by the leaders of Russian orthodoxy ""do not mean a complete break of the Eucharistic communion.""

However, it is a significant show of resistance to the authority of Bartholomew, who is considered the ""first among equals"" among Orthodox leaders.

According to the Interfax news agency, Ilarion warned of a split in the church if efforts to move the Ukrainian church beyond Russian authority continue.

""We will be forced to completely break the Eucharistic communion and this will mean Constantinople patriarch, who often positions himself as the head of the planet's 300 million Orthodox, will no longer be its head,"" he said.

The church in Ukraine has been tied to the Moscow Patriarchate for hundreds of years, although many parishes have split off over the past two decades to form a schismatic church.

Calls for self-government have increased since Moscow's 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine and its support for pro-Russia insurgents in eastern Ukraine.

Russian Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Kirill strongly condemned the dispatch of the envoys while opening Friday's meeting of the Holy Synod. He compared the move to the Ecumenical Patriarchate's actions during the split in the Russian Orthodox Church in the 1920s.

Metropolitan Onufriy, the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church that answers to Moscow Patriarchate, told the Holy Synod via a video call that the bishops sent by Bartholomew I had already arrived in Ukraine and had established contacts with the heads of the Ukrainian Orthodoxy.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has urged the Istanbul-based Patriarchate to grant Ukrainian Orthodox clerics full ecclesiastical independence from Moscow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters Friday that ""worrying information about possible decisions regarding the church in Ukraine causes concern.""

Peskov noted that ""the state can't interfere in the church affairs,"" but added that ""preservation of the Orthodox unity is the only preferable scenario for Moscow, as well as for the entire Orthodox world.""",world
"In cities and towns across Syria's last opposition-held province, Idlib, residents poured into the streets on Friday to demonstrate against President Bashar Assad's government in defiance of an expected offensive to retake the territory.

In the provincial capital, Idlib city, and in towns including Kafranbel, Dana, and al-Bab, demonstrators filled the streets after noon prayers and chanted against Assad, raising the tri-color green, white and black flag that has become the banner of Syria's 2011 uprising, activists said.

The demonstrations were reported on the activist-run sites Aleppo Media Center, Orient News, and other social media pages.

Fridays have become the customary day for protests throughout the Arab world since the 2011 uprisings that swept through the region.

Assad's government and its backers, Russia and Iran, say Idlib is ruled by terrorists, and have threatened to seize it by force.

Wissam Zarqa, a university teacher in Idlib, said demonstrators were flying the tri-color flag to rebut the government line that Idlib is dominated by the al-Qaida linked Levant Liberation Committee group.

The province, population 3 million, is now the final shelter for close to 1.5 million displaced Syrians that fled fighting in other parts of Syria. Many say they will not return to government-ruled areas.

Government and Russian forces bombed towns and villages in the province earlier this week, killing more than a dozen civilians and damaging two hospitals. But the strikes eased on Wednesday amid talks between the opposition's main regional sponsor Turkey, and Russia and Turkey.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are slated to meet Monday, said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.

""We will continue our efforts with Iran and with Russia. ... (and) on international platforms as well,"" said Cavusoglu in comments carried live on Turkish television.

Turkish media said the two leaders would meet in the Russian city of Sochi.

Turkey has warned strongly against military action, saying it would trigger a humanitarian catastrophe. Its military and defense chiefs visited border areas on Friday to inspect troop reinforcements sent to its Hatay and Gaziantep provinces.

Turkey has 12 military posts inside Idlib province, and activists reported on Thursday that Turkish reinforcements crossed over into Syria to fortify the installations.

The United Nations said that in the first 12 days of September, over 30,000 people have been internally displaced by an intense aerial bombing campaign. Most of the displaced headed toward the border with Turkey, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, packing already overcrowded camps there.

The U.N.'s World Food Program said it, alongside partners, were already delivering monthly food rations for nearly 600,000 people. It said it was prepared to deliver emergency food assistance for up to 1 million people.",world
"A recent bout of fighting between Yemeni government forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition and Shiite rebels around the Red Sea port city of Hodeida could jeopardize shipments of 46,000 tons of wheat expected to arrive within the next ten days, the World Food Program said on Friday.

The latest offensive began last week following the failure of what was hoped to be renewed peace talks to resume in Geneva. It was concentrated in the eastern and southern entrances to the city, which is considered the lifeline of Yemen.

WFP spokesman Herve Verhoosel said humanitarian workers, infrastructure and food supplies have been targeted in recent days as clashes are still ongoing near the Red Sea Mill Silos, a critical facility for WFP operations.

The fighting could impact WFP's ability to supply up to 3.5 million people in dire need in northern and central Yemen for one month, he said.

He said a mortar shell launched by an unidentified armed group also hit a WFP warehouse in Hodeida city holding enough food to assist 19,200 people, wounding a guard at the warehouse.

The fighting for Hodeida has also effectively shut down the main artery linking the port city to the rest of the country, the Save the Children charity said Thursday.

Tamer Kirolos of Save the Children said ""it's quite literally a matter of life and death"" for the main road linking Hodeida to the capital Sanaa to remain open.

""This year alone we expect some 400,000 children under five to suffer from severe acute malnutrition ... Unless supply routes remain open this figure could increase dramatically, putting the lives of thousands of children at risk from entirely preventable causes,"" he said.

He urged warring parties ""to end hostilities immediately, commit to a ceasefire and give peace a chance.""

The government forces first tried to retake Hodeida in June, but their offensive was stalemated by the rebels' resistance.

One main objective of the ongoing offensive is to cut off the road between Hodeida and Sanaa, thus depriving the capital city, which is controlled by the Iranian-backed Houthis, from supplies arriving by sea. Government forces are also trying to cut off the road to Taiz, a fiercely contested and strategic city south of Hodeida.

A Saudi apache meanwhile crashed in Yemen's easternmost province of al-Mahra on Friday, killing two crew people, tribal leaders said on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals.

The state-run Saudi Press Agency, quoting military spokesman Col. Turki al-Maliki, acknowledged the death of a ""pilot and his co-pilot"" in a helicopter that crashed following a ""technical fault."" He said the Saudi Royal Land Forces helicopter went down at 8:20 a.m. Friday while conducting operations in Yemen's al-Mahra province.

Impoverished Yemen has been embroiled in the war pitting the Saudi-led coalition against the Iran-aligned Houthis since March 2015. The war against the rebels has devastated impoverished Yemen, turning the Arab nation into the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 20 million people in need of assistance.",world
"Slovenia's new prime minister used to make people laugh. Handling the disparate demands of his five-party coalition government is unlikely to leave much time for jokes.

Once a satirist who impersonated prominent politicians, Marjan Sarec has taken the helm of a largely centrist government — a rare phenomenon, at least recently, in Central Europe where populists have been on the march from Italy to Poland.

Sarec, who has become Slovenia's youngest ever premier at 40, will face a tough job keeping the minority government afloat. After all, the government's majority in parliament is slim and the right-wing opposition is not going to give Sarec a honeymoon in office.

Enacting too many reforms is not going to be easy in that environment and that could potentially lead to disgruntlement in a country of just 2 million people.

The tight parliamentary arithmetic was evident Thursday when the new government was narrowly endorsed. Only half the 90-member backed the government, just enough to keep away from power the anti-immigrant allies of Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Analysts warned it is too early to say whether the elevation of a moderate government spells a turning point in the region.

""At stake now is Europe, more than Slovenia,"" said Janez Markes, an analyst for the Delo newspaper. ""Slovenia at this moment, I hate to say it, is not part of the problem.""

The success of the new government could depend heavily on whether Sarec, who gave up a successful acting career when he first entered politics, proves he is up to the task.

Sarec served twice as the mayor of his native Kamnik, in central Slovenia before gaining prominence when he forced a presidential runoff vote last year against veteran politician Borut Pahor.

""It is easier to observe from the side and criticize than to do something,"" Sarec said Thursday in parliament. ""It is time to start working now.""

One of the mainstays of Sarec's act was impersonating former prime minister, Janez Jansa, who is now his main right-wing opponent.

With a group of young artists, Sarec hosted a satirical radio show dubbed 'Radio Ga Ga' that was popular throughout Slovenia in the 1990s. Some of his performances show Sarec altering his voice to mock politicians' accents, singing or screaming with a kitchen cloth on his head as an alternative poet.

Saso Hribar, a journalist who worked with Sarec, says he remembers the new prime minister as highly professional and considers him thoroughly prepared for his any of his roles.

""Sarec blew up a good private business when he gave up acting,"" Hribar quipped.

As the new prime minister, Sarec is certain to face strong opposition from Jansa's Slovenian Democratic Party, which won most votes at June 3 election, but not enough to form the government.

Linked to Hungary's Orban, Jansa ""will try to do anything to subvert this government,"" said Darko Strajn, the head of Alternative Academy think tank.

However, Strajn said Sarec is a political ""personality in the making,"" and his readiness to compromise and his negotiating prowess to form the 5-party coalition, should serve him well.

"Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians gathered on Saturday to welcome returning leaders of the once-banned Oromo Liberation Front amid sweeping reforms to bring opposition groups back to politics.

The OLF and two other organizations were removed from a list of terror groups earlier this year after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office. He invited them to come home as he vowed to widen the political space in a country where the ruling coalition, in power since 1991, and affiliated parties hold every seat in parliament.

Earlier Saturday, some 1,500 OLF fighters returned to Ethiopia from neighboring Eritrea. The group since the 1970s has advocated the ""right to national self-determination"" for the Oromo people, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group.

A large concert was being held in Meskel Square in the capital, Addis Ababa, to welcome OLF leader Dawud Ibsa and others arriving from Eritrea's capital. Events also were held in Oromia, the largest region among Ethiopia's federal states.

""I'm happy to be here after 26 years of struggle from outside of Ethiopia,"" the OLF leader told reporters upon his arrival. ""We have been struggling to bring the changes that we are seeing now in Ethiopia. We are now seeing positive signs that include the respect for rule of law. That's why we came here.""

Abiy, the first Oromo politician to become prime minister since the ruling party came to power in 1991, took office after more than two years of deadly anti-government protests in the Oromia and Amhara regions spread throughout the country and led to a state of emergency. Tensions in restive areas have dramatically declined as the new government released several thousand prisoners, unblocked websites and welcomed opposition voices.

""This is a day that we have been longing for,"" Milkessa Hunde, a university lecturer, told The Associated Press. ""This is why thousands of Qeeros (youths in Oromia) sacrificed their lives. We are eternally indebted to them.""

After clashes in recent days between youth from Oromia and the capital over displays of the OLF flag in Addis Ababa, the prime minister condemned any incitement of violence. He added, however, that ""the right of freedom of expression includes the use of a flag of choice.""

Police used tear gas to separate the two sides as some businesses closed.

"A French art school was forced to apologize to students after some noticed their faces had been darkened in an advertising photo to make the group appear more diverse.

Other students saw they had been replaced entirely in the photo by images of darker-skinned people.

A side-by-side comparison of the original and photoshopped images circulating on social media features some students from the Emile Cohl art school in Lyon with darkened facial features to make them appear black -- and two black students added to the middle of the group, the New York Post reported.

The school denied allegations of ""blackwashing"" -- making itself appear more diverse in its advertising than in reality.

The photo was posted to the school’s new website to promote the opening of a Los Angeles branch within four years. The Daily Mail reported that part of the school's U.S. promotion effort was to bid for funding from American animation studios.

Antoine Riviere, director of the school, told French site Rue89Lyon that a California-based ad agency, not the school, was to blame. The article did not name the firm.

""This is an initiative of U.S. providers,"" Riviere said. ""It's something that has completely escaped us.""

The image was immediately removed from the school’s website and servers when students notified school officials after it was posted Sept. 5.

The school has since cut ties with the firm, another officials said, according to the Post.",world
"A prosecutor on Friday praised the Cincinnati police officers who killed a gunman at a downtown office building as heroes, saying they probably saved countless lives.

Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters cleared the four officers who responded within minutes to the shootings at Fifth Third Bancorp headquarters. The officers killed 29-year-old Omar Enrique Santa Perez after Perez fatally shot three people and wounded two others.

""Not only were the actions of the officers justified, they were heroic,"" Deters wrote in a news release. He will ""never know how many lives"" they saved that day, he wrote.

Perez carried some 200 rounds of ammunition when he entered the bank building lobby the morning of Sept. 6, Police Chief Eliot Isaac said at a news conference the day after the shooting.

Both survivors are out of the hospital. Whitney Austin, who was shot at least a dozen times, returned home Tuesday but faces what her husband calls ""a long road"" in recovering physically and mentally.

Austin, a 37-year-old vice president at Fifth Third, told bank spokeswoman Laura Trujillo she was grateful to be home with her kids.

""I got to see my motivation for living,"" Austin said in a statement. ""I'm thankful to be alive, for all the good wishes for everyone who helped.""

Brian Sarver, a 45-year-old contractor released from the hospital Monday, offered his thanks to God and prayers for other victims and families. A 64-year-old contractor, a 48-year old bank employee and a 25-year-old engineer who worked as a consultant for the bank died in the attack.

The Fifth Third Foundation donated $1 million to support family members of those who were shot and anyone who suffered physical or psychological trauma as a result.

The bank announced Friday it started the Cincinnati Strong Victims Fund in partnership with the National Center for Victims of Crime. It hopes to match its $1 million gift with donations from community members. People can make donations online or at a Fifth Third bank branch.

Police are still trying to determine why Perez opened fire inside the building.

A leading right-wing presidential candidate in Brazil appeared to backtrack Thursday on his initial decision to skip all seven remaining debates before the Oct. 7 election, saying that he may participate in three.

Earlier, an attorney for Congressman Jair Bolsonaro said that the candidate would not attend the remaining debates because they did not add to the race.

After a campaign event in the countryside of Sao Paulo state, the congressman later said he could not ""lose contact with the people.""

""I can't be in a studio, there are 40 days to the election,"" Bolsonaro told journalists. He said he wouldn't attend all the debates, but his ""idea"" was to make an appearance at some.

The public vacillation comes after a poll showed a spike in the number of Brazilians who wouldn't vote for Bolsonaro under any circumstances following two recent TV debates.

Bolsonaro's performances were loved by hardcore fans, but were criticized by moderate politicians and voters who he needs to win over.

The congressman was only mildly targeted on both occasions by seven opponents.

A Datafolha poll published Wednesday shows jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva with support among 39 percent of those surveyed, but he is likely to be barred from seeking office because of a corruption conviction. He denies any wrongdoing and was not allowed to participate in the debates despite leading the polls.

Bolsonaro is running second at 19 percent, which is far ahead of former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, who is da Silva's likely replacement and choice for vice president.

The same Datafolha poll said 39 percent of voters would never choose Bolsonaro. It also showed that 43 percent of women wouldn't support him, a major concern for the congressman in a country where females comprise 52 percent of the electorate.

During both debates, Bolsonaro argued that free market policies, not the government, should regulate how much women are paid.

The Datafolha poll, which has margin of error of 2 percentage points, was based on interviews with 8,433 people between Aug. 20 and 21.

Regardless of Bolsonaro's decision to bow out of the debates, right-leaning Geraldo Alckmin said Wednesday that all candidates want to face the congressman in a run-off because they will be more likely to win.

The Datafolha poll showed Bolsonaro could lose a likely run-off on Oct. 28 to centrist Marina Silva, left-leaning Ciro Gomes and Alckmin, who is polling at less than 10 percent.

The poll also projected that Bolsonaro would still beat left-leaning Haddad in such a scenario even if da Silva leaves the race and endorses him as candidate.

Free airtime on TV and radio given to each candidate from Sep. 1 to Oct. 4 may also play role.

On Thursday, the country's electoral court said Bolsonaro will barely be heard or seen on programs based on his electoral coalition's representation in Brazil's lower house.

Bolsonaro's free airtime will total eight seconds, compared to 5 minutes and 32 seconds for Alckmin, and 2 minutes and 23 seconds for da Silva or Haddad.

Free airtime has proven decisive in other Brazilian presidential elections, but analysts have wondered what impact it will have as more voters rely on social media for news.",world

Brazilian President Michel Temer is endorsing another party's candidate as well as his own in October's presidential election.

Temer said in an interview published Thursday by the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper that he sees former Sao Paulo Gov. Geraldo Alckmin of the right-leaning Brazilian Social Democracy Party as a candidate who would carry on with his work.

Temer's own centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement has nominated former Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles, who has appeared to be trying to distance himself from the unpopular president.

Several of the parties that support Temer in Congress have joined Alckmin's bid for the election.

""If you said: 'Who does the administration endorse?' It seems it is Geraldo Alckmin, doesn't it? The (Temer) administration's political base, including his party, is with him,"" he said.

Asked whether an Alckmin victory would mean the continuation of his administration, Temer replied: ""That can be true. Firstly for what I hear him say. Secondly because those that helped us make reforms will be in the Cabinet if he wins.""

It's not clear either candidate would welcome Temer's endorsement. A Datafolha poll in June found that 82 percent of Brazilians believed their president was doing a poor job, the highest figure since the institute began asking the question in 1989.

""I will be cautious not to campaign for either (Alckmin or Meirelles),"" said Temer, who took office in 2016 after Dilma Rousseff was impeached.

Both of the candidates themselves are also running far behind in the polls so far. The leader is jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is likely going to be barred from running.

Also on Thursday, another prominent presidential candidate filed a request for Brazil's top electoral court to bar da Silva's bid.

Conservative congressman Jair Bolsonaro, who polls second, made the move after the Workers' Party registered the former president's run on Wednesday.

Brazil's Attorney General Raquel Dogde made the same request hours after da Silva's ticket was registered at the court.

Thursday marks the first official day of campaigning for all 13 presidential candidates.",world

Just two months ahead of Brazil's presidential election, leading candidates are struggling to find anybody willing to be their running mates.

Big names who have shunned offers to run for vice president include generals, businessmen, an astronaut, a famous actor and even a descendent of Brazil's royal family.

Even though three of the last five Brazilian leaders came to office as vice presidents, potential candidates this year have cited reasons ranging from family matters to opposition by their parties, all saying effectively, ""Thanks, but no thanks.""

The apparent disinterest in hitching one's reputation to any candidate comes at a time when the political class in Latin America's largest nation is deeply unpopular after years of corruption scandals.

The race is also up in the air because poll-leading former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is in prison and likely to be barred from running.

The candidate struggling most to find a viable running mate appears to be Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain who presents himself as an outsider despite being in Congress since 1991. Promises to crack down on corruption and crime have gained him a large following and put him second in the polls, but he has come under strong criticism for numerous racist, sexist and homophobic comments over the years.

Bolsonaro was fined for telling a female member of Congress in 2014 that she was so ugly she ""didn't deserve to be raped."" More recently, in April the attorney general charged him with racism and discrimination for comments about blacks, indigenous people, refugees, women and gays. Bolsonaro often defends himself by arguing the press takes his statements out of context.

""The cost of associating with a candidate like him, homophobic and machista, is very high,"" said Sergio Praca, a political science professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university in Rio de Janeiro. ""Being Bolsonaro's vice presidential candidate and losing (the election) would be bad for anybody.""

That apprehension was on display with one of Bolsonaro's early picks, reserve Gen. Augusto Heleno. After a public courtship by Bolsonaro, Heleno said last month that he had to decline because his party didn't approve the alliance.

Coalitions are vital in Brazilian politics because there are more than three dozen parties — more than 20 of them large enough to have some representation in Congress.

Presidential candidates often seek to cement those alliances with a vice presidential hopeful from a separate party. The size of the allied party also matters because the free campaign air time granted by law is based on current seats in Congress.

Alliances can be risky though. Current President Michel Temer took over as vice president in 2016 when President Dilma Rousseff was impeached and removed for illegal management of the federal budget. Rousseff and others from her left-leaning Workers' Party accused Temer, from a large centrist party, of being part of the plot against her. Temer denies the accusations.

Bolsonaro, who has promised to fill his government with current and former military people, has courted a second reserve general, Hamilton Mourao. Disagreements between the two men's parties initially nixed an alliance, though local reports say they are still discussing the possibility.

Bolsonaro has also reportedly courted Marcos Pontes, who was Brazil's first astronaut; Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Braganca, an heir to Brazil's last emperor; and lawyer Janaina Paschoal, who wrote impeachment legislation that eventually led to the removal of Rousseff.

A spokeswoman for Bolsonaro declined to comment on deliberations for a running mate.

Bolsonaro is not the only one struggling. Marina Silva, a former environmental minister running third in the polls, reportedly tried to recruit actor Marcos Palmeira and was rejected.

Geraldo Alckmin, former Sao Paulo governor, publicly tried to court Josue Gomes, who apart from being a successful businessman is also the son of former Vice President Jose Alencar. Gomes published an opinion piece in the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo supporting Alckmin but declining to run for personal reasons.

""In the case of Alckmin, he is struggling to show electoral viability,"" said Mauricio Santoro, a political science professor at Rio de Janeiro's state university. ""He has not been able to convince people he is a good bet.""

Potential running mates can't be blamed for being skeptical. Silva ran for president in 2010 and 2014 and came in third both times. In his 2006 bid for president, Alckmin got fewer votes in the second-round runoff with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva than he did in the crowded first round.

Alckmin's campaign declined comment on the search, and Silva's did not respond to messages.

The race has a huge wild card in da Silva, who in April began serving a 12-year sentence for a corruption conviction. While he is barred from running by law, da Silva's Workers' Party insists he will be its candidate.

However, many analysts believe party leaders may name former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad as the vice presidential pick and then make him the presidential candidate once Brazil's electoral court officially denies the candidacy of da Silva, universally called Lula by Brazilians.

""The prospects for this election are still murky,"" said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper, a university in Sao Paulo. ""The question mark is Lula, who should not be a candidate, but we don't know what will happen.""",world
"Brazil's jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pledged on Friday to block or undo privatizations if he is returned to the office he held from 2003 to 2010.

Da Silva will likely be barred from running for the presidency again by Brazil's electoral court, but his statements are seen as the program of his left-leaning Workers' Party ahead of October's elections.

In an article published in the newspaper Correio Braziliense, da Silva said he would reverse the ongoing process to privatize state-run energy company Eletrobras. He also criticized politicians who contend that oil giant Petrobras needs to be sold.

Unpopular President Michel Temer has pushed forward with plans to sell Eletrobras and several members of his administration believe Petrobras should be privatized.

Da Silva also criticized Temer's decision to allow a joint venture that gives Boeing control of Brazilian plane-maker Embraer. The former president vowed to halt the move.

Da Silva leads the polls despite his corruption and money laundering conviction. He can still appeal the decision, which he deems to be political persecution.

""I have the historical obligation, no matter what my personal circumstances now, of conducting our country to a reencounter with democracy and sovereignty, with a clear commitment to revoke through a popular referendum every measure that damages our independence,"" da Silva wrote.

Media in Brazil media have reported that former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad is the Workers' Party favorite to replace da Silva as candidate if the former president is indeed barred.

Brazil's October election will take place on Oct.7.

Though a member of another party, left-leaning presidential hopeful Ciro Gomes is seen as a potential heir to da Silva's votes and also made the same anti-privatization pledges a few weeks ago.

In a letter to Boeing, Gomes said it is ""a grave inconvenience"" that Embraer is bought 100 days before Brazil's presidential elections.

Earlier this week, a state-run energy company in the state of Piaui was sold in what was considered the kick-off of the process to privatize Eletrobras.

Members of the Temer administration say the measure is necessary so Brazil can reduce its budget deficit and boost its private sector, while critics believe selling Eletrobras will give the country's waters away to foreign companies. Brazil's main energy source is hydroelectricity.",world
"Malaysia's designated prime minister-in-waiting, Anwar Ibrahim, said Saturday that he has no reason to doubt his former political nemesis will hand over the leadership position within two years as planned after sorting out deep-seated issues like corruption.

Anwar and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad put aside their 20-year feud to help their four-party alliance win elections in May, leading to the country's first change of power since independence from Britain in 1957.

Anwar, 70, was convicted of sodomy in 2015 in a case that he said was politically motivated. He was freed and pardoned by the king shortly after the recent elections.

The alliance had agreed that Mahathir would be prime minister and then hand over the reins to Anwar. On Saturday, Anwar said that contesting a by-election after a lawmaker from his party resigned earlier in the week was ""well within the plan"" of his eventual succession, but that he was in no rush to take over.

""I think the succession plan is as agreed,"" Anwar said. ""Let Prime Minister Mahathir conduct the affairs of the state. We support him, that's important. And I don't think we should be rushing to it, because he's playing a very critical role for the country.""

""The country needs stability and a strong leader now and I want to make sure that he is effective in his position,"" he added.

Anwar spoke to reporters on the sidelines of the Singapore Summit, which was attended by business leaders and academics from Asia.

He said he has a close relationship with Mahathir and sees no reason to doubt his sincerity, given how he has acted in the four months since the historic electoral victory.

The government has clamped down on corruption by making the country's anti-corruption body accountable to Parliament instead of just the prime minister, Anwar said.

It also has recovered millions from the $4.5 billion that reportedly was misappropriated from the indebted 1MDB Malaysian state investment fund, he added.

Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is facing seven charges of criminal breach of trust, abuse of power and money laundering involving the transfer of 42 million ringgit ($10.2 million) into his bank accounts from SRC International, a former unit of the 1MDB fund.

Mahathir, 93, has endorsed Anwar's move to contest the by-election and said he would not renege on his promise to hand over power, despite not having settled on a date.

A by-election will be held in the southern coastal town of Port Dickson after a lawmaker from Anwar's party resigned to make way for his comeback. The Election Commission will set a date for the vote, which must be held within two months.",world

"A swift Utah wildfire fanned by high winds has more than doubled its size as it burns through dry terrain and forces evacuations of hundreds of homes, the U.S. Forest Service said Friday.

The blaze south of Spanish Fork grew to 84 square miles (217 square kilometers) from 31 square miles (80 square kilometers) Thursday night when authorities ordered evacuations in three communities. Spanish Fork is about 50 minutes south of Salt Lake City.

No homes have been reported damaged.

Aircraft were set to drop retardant and water on the fire, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Suzie Tenhagen.

""Their main focus today is protecting those folks' homes,"" she said.

Lorene Miller told KUTV that she's lived in the small community of Woodland Hills for 12 years and it was the first time she had to leave her home. She loaded up her kids' baby pictures and videos and fled when authorities raised the alarm.

""There's nothing we can do about it but pray, I guess,"" said Miller, one of hundreds who took refuge at a high-school evacuation center.

The hot, windy weather that has created tinderbox conditions in the area is expected to continue into the weekend.

The fire is also threatening to converge with a second, smaller fire.

Sparked by lightning in a forested, rough terrain on Sept. 6, the fire raged out of control amid high winds and was only 2 percent contained Friday.

The fire has also forced road closures, including U.S. Highway 89.

About 250 people are fighting the blaze, including helicopters and heavy air tankers, but the winds made it hard for the aircraft to take off.

Forest managers said they decided to contain the fire and let it burn in a remote area to protect firefighters and boost habitat in the area where wildfires are part of the ecosystem.

Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, criticized that decision made during drought conditions — calling it ""inept decision making"" in a tweet.

"In high school, I read Jack London’s “To Start a Fire.” This engrossing story depicted a man and his dog who take a winter trek through the Yukon. Arrogantly ignoring the advice of an older man, the protagonist confidently believes that he is prepared for the harshness of the cold wintry environment. After falling through ice into freezing waters, he desperately tries to start a fire. However, he fails to notice that he starts a fire under a snowy tree branch, which extinguishes his fire, leaving the man scrambling to restart the fire. His confidence is misplaced and his efforts are futile. He eventually succumbs to hypothermia, and nature claims another victim. It was a classic story of human vs. nature. And nature won.

As Hurricane Florence bore down on the Carolina coast, there was a very real human vs. nature scenario unfolding. More than 1 million people were under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders. However, not everyone leaves. Why do some people choose to stay during a hurricane whereas others comply to evacuate? Surely, there are numerous reasons why people might stay: a desire to protect their property, a fear of the unknown, or a lack of resources or fewer options may preclude evacuation. Or perhaps some people stay to prove—to others and to themselves—they are not afraid. Afraid of what? Well, death, of course.

Nature is powerful and needs to be respected. And our fear of death may drive us to make unwise decisions.

A long line of psychological research suggests that people are uniquely afraid of death. Terror Management Theory, pioneered in the 1980s by social psychologists Jeff Greenberg, Tom Pyszczynski, and Sheldon Solomon, argues that people are intelligent enough to realize that every living being dies, and self-aware enough to understand that they, too, will eventually suffer a similar fate: death. This awareness should be anxiety-provoking; after all, if everyone is destined to die, what’s the point of life? However, most of us don’t walk around gripped with existential fear. Instead, we go about our lives investing in things that bring us meaning: engaging relationships, cultural practices, religious beliefs, and purposeful work. So, in large part, we don’t consciously recognize this fear of death. However, deeper motivations that we aren’t always aware of may be at play.

Clever psychological experiments have shown that when people are reminded of death, either by asking to write about what they think will happen to them when they die or being shown images or words related to death, the research participants often respond defensively. They protect their cherished views, rally around people who are like them and distance themselves from or become aggressive toward those who are unlike them, and assert their dominance to reaffirm that they do not fear death. Think of all of things that people do to prove they are not afraid of death: they hurl themselves out of airplanes with a tiny parachute, fling themselves off cliffs with only a bungee cord tied around their ankles, or drive automobiles at incredibly high rates of speed for hours in an oval shared by dozens of other death-defying car enthusiasts. And while these activities may cause us to feel alive, they may do so by asserting our dominance over death. After all, how afraid of death can I be if I willingly choose to confront it?

Our desire to symbolically conquer death by showing that we are not afraid may lead to riskier behaviors. We may overestimate our abilities to survive and defeat the threatening environment, and underestimate the harshness of nature. We may trust our skill and ignore the sheer power of the impending threat. Like the unnamed protagonist in Jack London’s short story, we may choose arrogance over humility, perhaps in part to prove to ourselves (and to others) that we do not fear death. However, nature is powerful and needs to be respected. And our fear of death may drive us to make unwise decisions. I’m sure that some of the people choosing not to evacuate have good reasons for doing so. However, I encourage us all to acknowledge, with humility, our own frailty, and begin to accept the existential reality of what it means to be human, no matter how scary that is.",world

""We could just kind of hear echoes of the dog barking and yelping and whining, splashing, kind of struggling,"" Allen told WRIC-News.

Beasley, struggling in roughly three feet of water, latched onto inflatables thrown down the well before a firefighter rapelled down and pulled the dog out, the news station reported.

Beasley was taken to a local veterinary clinic, where he was determined to be in critical condition. The dog had fluid around his heart and lungs, and was also hypothermic, Allen said. Beasley's oxygen levels were also affected due to the amount of carbon dioxide he inhaled. He has been on oxygen since arriving at the animal hospital.

But the pup now appears to be on the mend. While Beasley isn’t in the clear yet, “he seems to be doing much better,” Allen told Fox News on Saturday.

“They have lowered his oxygen and will hopefully be off of it later this evening.

The rival Koreas on Friday opened their first liaison office near their tense border to facilitate better communication and exchanges ahead of their leaders' summit in Pyongyang next week.

The office's opening at the North Korean border town of Kaesong is the latest in a series of reconciliatory steps the Koreas have taken this year. The office is the first of its kind since the Koreas were divided at the end of World War II.

The Koreas so far have been using telephone and fax-like communication channels when they want to arrange talks and exchange messages. But those channels have been often suspended when tensions rose over North Korea's nuclear program.

In an opening ceremony at Kaesong, South Korea's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said the office will become the ""cradle of Korean co-prosperity.""

""We'll sit face to face, exchange our thoughts fast and accurately and put our heads together to resolve difficult matters,"" he said in remarks distributed by his office.

About 15-20 South Korean officials are expected to stay at the office and a nearby lodging facility in Kaesong during the weekdays and take turns staffing the office on weekends, according to Seoul's Unification Ministry.

They will deal with North Korean officials stationed at the office to discuss various inter-Korean issues, exchange messages from their capitals and facilitate civilian exchange programs, the ministry said in a statement.

Kaesong is where the Koreas' now-stalled jointly run factory complex is located. The park, which combined South Korean initiatives, capital and technology with North Korea's cheap labor, was seen as a test case for unification of the Koreas. But its operation was suspended in 2016 amid an escalating standoff over North Korea's long-range rocket launch.

The resumption of the Kaesong park and other dormant inter-Korean cooperation projects won't likely happen anytime soon because U.S.-led international sanctions on North Korea remain in place. Seoul officials said workers renovated some of the buildings used in the complex to use as the liaison office and the lodging facility.

The liaison office's opening came before South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meet for the third time this year next week to discuss denuclearization of the peninsula and other issues.

During the previous meetings with Moon and a separate historic summit with President Donald Trump, Kim has expressed his vague commitment to complete denuclearization of the peninsula. He's also dismantled his nuclear and rocket-engine testing sites. But nuclear diplomacy was later stalemated as U.S. officials demanded Kim take more significant steps before receiving concessions like a joint declaration to end the Korean War.

Moon is to fly to Pyongyang next Tuesday for a three-day trip that he says will focus on facilitating talks between the United States and North Korea and finding ways to ease a military standoff along the Koreas' heavily fortified border.",world
"Macedonia's conservative opposition leader has told supporters to vote ""with their conscience"" in an upcoming referendum on changing the country's name.

The opposition is strongly against changing the country's name to ""North Macedonia,"" a move meant to resolve a longstanding dispute with Greece, and had been widely expected to urge a ""no"" vote for the Sept. 30 referendum. Their appeal Wednesday appeared to be the latest boost for the ""yes"" campaign, which has received strong backing from the United States and western governments.

In remarks published on the VMRO-DPMNE party's website, leader Hristijan Mickoski said the vote was up to ""each individual, with their conscience and morals"" to ""decide what's best for their family and our beloved Macedonia.""

The name change means Greece will drop its veto over the country joining NATO. Greece has worried that its neighbor's name implied a claim on the ancient heritage of its own region of Macedonia.

Macedonia's center-left government launched its referendum campaign earlier this week, urging people to support the name change.

The campaign is being vocally supported by western governments, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel all visited the capital Skopje last week to urge Macedonian voters to back the deal.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters at a Pentagon briefing Tuesday he was planning to visit Macedonia at the weekend, adding that he was concerned about alleged acts of ""mischief"" by Russia to try and block the country's path to NATO membership.

Russia denies claims of interference but openly opposes NATO expansion eastward.

Wess Mitchell, a U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, will also visit Macedonia Thursday.

Kosovo's President Hashim Thaci also buoyed the ""yes"" campaign at a meeting Wednesday in Skopje.

""From my humble position, I call on all people in Macedonia to participate in the referendum and to say ""yes."" I think this is an historic moment that needs to be seized,"" Thaci told reporters.

"More than 6,000 fraternity chapters in the United States and Canada will be forced to implement a ban on any alcohol with more than 15 percent alcohol by volume, officials said.

The North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) released a statement Tuesday that its fraternity members would be adopting a new standard “prohibiting hard alcohol from fraternity chapter facilities and events.”

Under the ban, any alcohol above 15 percent ABV will be prohibited from any chapter facility or event. The NIC is ordering over 6,100 chapters on 800 campus in the U.S. and Canada to implement the ban by Sept. 1, 2019.

“At their core, fraternities are about brotherhood, personal development and providing a community of support,” NIC President and CEO Judson Horras said in a press release. “Alcohol abuse and its serious consequences endanger this very purpose.”

The new rule comes after fraternity pledges suffered alcohol-related deaths at Louisiana State University and Penn State University last year.

EX-PENN STATE FRATERNITY MEMBER SENTECED TO HOUSE ARREST, PROBATION IN PLEDGE’S DEATH

One Penn State pledge, 19-year-old Tim Piazza, died in February 2017 after a night of heavy drinking and a series of falls that left him with a fractured skull and severe abdominal injuries.

Ryan Burke, a former fraternity brother, was the first of more than 20 defendants to plead guilty to four counts of hazing and five alcohol violations in Piazza’s death. He was sentenced in July to three months house arrest.

Maxwell Gruver, an 18-year-old Louisiana State University fraternity pledge, died at a Baton Rouge hospital on Sept. 14, 2017 after fraternity members found him lying on a couch at the fraternity house and couldn't tell if he was breathing, police said.

TEN ARRESTED IN LSU FRAT PLEDGE’S DRINKING DEATH

An autopsy report revealed that Gruver’s blood-alcohol content level at the time of his death was 0.495, nearly six times the state’s legal limit for driving. The coroner concluded that he died of acute alcohol intoxication with aspiration.

The Distilled Spirits Council issued a statement Wednesday attributed to its interim CEO, Clarkson Hine, commending the NIC for taking steps to address alcohol abuse among fraternity members but adding that such policies should treat all forms of alcohol equally.

""Such an approach sends a misleading message that some forms of alcohol are 'softer' than others, and undercuts equivalence information in the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, and the majority of college alcohol education materials, which teach students that 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine and a cocktail with 1.5 fluid ounces of distilled spirits each contains the same amount of alcohol,"" Hine said.

While the NIC’s ban looks to enhance the safety of its members, it may not be tough enough.

There is no mention of any means to limit the amount of alochol consumed.

Chapter facilities and events will be allowed to serve alcohol with more than 15 percent ABV under the new standard if it is served by a licensed third-party vendor.

The ban also targets hard alcohol but ignores beer, which is more common on campuses. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 12 ounces of a regular beer contains 5 percent alcohol.

Horras is hopeful for the new measure, saying that it “shows fraternities’ clear commitment and leadership to further their focus on the safety pf members and all in our communities.”

"Two more U.S. service members have been identified from the 55 boxes of war remains that North Korea returned in July, officials said Monday.

The U.S. military will be notifying the families within days, directors for the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) said, according to The Military Times.

“The ID’s will be made officially in the next couple of days, 2-3 days ‚and the family will be notified within 24 hours of the ID’s being officially made,” DPAA Chief Scientist John Byrd told the Times.

The service members' identities were confirmed through a DNA sample, matching chest X-rays and dental records, Byrd said.

He said the agency is confident the service members will be correctly reunited with their families.

""No doubt about it,"" Byrd said.

North Korea provided the 55 boxes in a delayed fulfillment of a commitment its leader, Kim Jong Un, made to President Trump at their Singapore summit on June 12.

The remains identified came from box 14 and box 16 of the 55 boxes, DPAA officials told the military paper. They were some of the most complete of those returned, they said.

Box 16's bones were ""so well-preserved"" that one of the scientists identified them as belonging to an African American male, just one day after the remains were received, The Times reported.

Byrd said the names will be announced publicly once the family is notified, the report said.

Nearly 7,700 U.S. service members were listed as missing and unaccounted for from the 1950-53 Korean War.

The Pentagon estimates that of the approximately 7,700 U.S. MIAs from the Korean War, about 5,300 are unaccounted for on North Korean soil.

Many families who are awaiting the return of their loved ones from the Korean War have already submitted DNA samples to the laboratory to aid in the process, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.

Richard Downes, whose father, Air Force Lt. Hal Downes, is among the Korean War missing, said this turnover of remains, having drawn worldwide attention, has the potential to put the U.S. back on track to finding and eventually identifying many more.

""These 55 can set the stage for more to come,"" Downes said.

"British police are investigating a series of “unexplained” deaths Monday after three people were apparently struck by a train in south London ahead of the morning rush hour.

The bodies – which have not yet been identified – were found near the Loughborough Junction station around 7:30 a.m. local time.

""At this time, we are treating their death as unexplained as we make a number of immediate inquiries,” said British Transport Police Detective Superintendent Gary Richardson. “I would ask anyone who was near to Loughborough Junction this morning, and saw something which they think might be relevant, please contact us as soon as possible.""

Transport police said the three were hit by a train, according to the Associated Press – but the circumstances surrounding their deaths were not immediately clear.

""We are in close contact with the British Transport Police who are urgently investigating this incident,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan posted on Twitter.

""My heart goes out to the families of the three people killed at Loughborough Junction station this morning,” he added.

Train traffic in the area has been delayed as police are on scene to investigate.

"A brave British dad chased off a giraffe after the animal trampled on his wife and three-year-old son in South Africa, leaving them critically injured.

Dr. Katy Williams, 35, and her son Finn were ""covered in blood"" and have undergone surgery after the attack near their home on the Blyde Wildlife Estate near Hoedspruit.

The scientist and her son were only saved from the female giraffe when her Brit husband Dr. Sam Williams confronted the beast.

The attack comes just months after a cameraman died after being head-butted by a giraffe while working on TV drama “Wild at Heart.”

Husband Sam was returning home from work around 6pm on Monday evening and saw his U.S.-born wife and son under being viciously attacked.

Sam, a scientist who works alongside his wife on the reserve, then called for emergency services and the Hoedspruit Medical Rescue team raced to the scene.

The giraffe, which had a two month old calf with it, is believed to have attacked the young mother and her son because it felt under threat when they surprised her.

Katy and Finn were waiting close to the family home for her husband to return from his daily training run in the hills on the nature reserve when they were trampled.

"The wealthy stock trader took elaborate steps to conceal the network of tunnels beneath his house in this Washington, D.C., suburb. Even the young man helping him dig them didn't know where they were.

A year ago, a deadly fire exposed Daniel Beckwitt's curious campaign to build an underground bunker for protection from a nuclear attack. Neighbors knew nothing about the tunnels before they heard Beckwitt's screams and saw smoke pouring from the house where 21-year-old Askia Khafra (ASK-ee-uh KA-fruh) died that afternoon.

Maryland prosecutors portray Beckwitt, a 27-year-old millionaire, as a paranoid computer hacker who recklessly endangered Khafra's life. In May, they secured Beckwitt's indictment on charges of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter.

Beckwitt's lawyer calls Khafra's death a tragic accident, not a crime. Defense attorney Robert Bonsib concedes Beckwitt is an ""unusual guy"" but says his client risked his own life in a failed attempt to rescue Khafra.

Beckwitt was freed on bond after his May arrest. His trial is scheduled for April 2019.

Monday marks the anniversary of the Sept. 10, 2017, fire. It's a day that Khafra's parents are dreading.

During a recent interview at their Silver Spring, Maryland, home, Dia Khafra, 69, said he and his wife, Claudia, tried to persuade Askia to stay away from Beckwitt's tunnels. Their son met Beckwitt online and agreed to help him dig the tunnels in exchange for Beckwitt's investments in an internet company Askia was launching.

""I always feared something dangerous would happen to him,"" the elder Khafra said.

Investigators found the younger Khafra's charred body in the basement of Beckwitt's Bethesda home. A hole in the concrete basement floor led to a shaft that dropped down 20 feet (6 meters) into tunnels that branched out roughly 200 feet (60 meters) in length.

A police report says Beckwitt told investigators how he tried to preserve his project's secrecy when he brought Khafra there. Beckwitt said he would rent a car, pick Khafra up and drive him to Manassas, Virginia, where he had the younger man don ""blackout glasses"" before driving him around for about an hour. Khafra spent days at a time working, eating and sleeping in the tunnels. He had his cellphone with him, but Beckwitt used internet ""spoofing"" to make it appear he was in Virginia, according to Montgomery County prosecutor Douglas Wink.

""These are the lengths the defendant went through in order to hide the truth from Askia Khafra as to where he was and to maintain the secrecy of these tunnels,"" Wink said during a May 31 hearing.

Beckwitt lived alone in ""extreme hoarder conditions,"" forcing the men to navigate a maze of junk and trash, Wink said. The tunnels had lights, an air circulation system and a heater powered by a ""haphazard daisy chain"" of power strips that created a fire risk, the prosecutor said.

Hours before the fire, Khafra texted Beckwitt to warn him it smelled like smoke in the tunnels. Beckwitt flipped a breaker that turned off lights in the tunnels but turned the power back on after Khafra said he couldn't see, Wink said.

Beckwitt ignored those ""obvious signs"" of danger, the prosecutor told a judge.

Wink said Beckwitt had a ""paranoid fixation"" on a possible nuclear attack by North Korea. Beckwitt's lawyer compared his client's concern to ""the days of the Cuban missile crisis.""

Bonsib said Khafra posted photos of himself in the tunnels on social media, suggesting he was proud of the work.

""He kept coming back,"" Bonsib said.

Beckwitt's lawyer described him as a successful ""day trader"" who has made millions trading stocks. Dia Khafra said his son was impressed by Beckwitt's wealth.

""I think Askia was very trusting,"" he said. ""He believed in the guy.""

Dia Khafra said he only met Beckwitt once, when he dropped off his son at their home. He seemed shy.

""He said he made his money off bitcoins,"" Khafra recalled.

Beckwitt lived with his parents at the Bethesda house until college. He enrolled at the University of Illinois, where campus police arrested him in 2013 on charges including computer fraud. He was suspected of installing keystroke logging devices on the Urbana school's computers. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years of probation, according to online court records.

The conviction didn't steer Beckwitt away from computers after he moved back to Maryland. In 2016, he spoke at a hacker convention using the alias ""3AlarmLampscooter"" and wearing a fire-resistant suit and visor that obscured his face.

Wink said Beckwitt was teaching his audience how to make thermite bombs to destroy computer data ""in order to get away with hacking.""

Bonsib said his client's use of a pseudonym and disguise was harmless, typical of the ""weird things"" people do on the internet.

County officials sued Beckwitt over his property's condition, calling it unsafe and a ""public nuisance."" Wooden boards now cover the doors and windows of the house, which is surrounded by a chain-link fence and police tape.

Meanwhile, Khafra's parents haven't touched their son's bedroom. The urn holding his ashes remains inside a cardboard box.

""We haven't had the courage to open that box,"" Dia Khafra said.",world
"A 24-year-old man was charged Monday with five counts of murder in the killing of his wife, three young children and their grandmother who were found dead in an Australia home almost a week after their deaths, police said.

The bodies of Mara Lee Harvey, 41, Charlotte, 3, Alice and Beatrix, 2-year-old twins and Beverley Quinn, 73, were discovered by police in Perth on Sunday.

Harvey’s husband, Anthony Robert Harvey, faces five counts of murder. On Monday, he appeared in Perth Magistrates Court via video link from Karratha Courthouse, 900 miles away.

Western Australia Police Commissioner Chris Dawson told reporters they believe Mara Harvey and her daughters died at home on September 3, while Quinn was killed while visiting the home the next day. It's unclear whether Anthony Harvey was the father of the children.

Their deaths were caused by a “blunt instrument and knives,” police said. No guns were used.

FAMILY OF SEVEN FOUND DEAD WITH GUNSHOT WOUNDS IN AUSTRALIA

Dawson said the women were attacked in the kitchen, while the children were killed elsewhere in the house.

Police also allege Harvey remained at the house for several days, then drove his car north.

He did not enter pleas or apply to be released on bail. A motive has not been released.

""This is a tragic event and it will no doubt have an impact not only on the family and friends of the deceased, but for the whole of the community and those first responders who are faced with attending a scene of multiple deceased people,"" Washington Police Assistant Commissioner Paul Steel said on Sunday.

A neighbor told WAToday that it was “sickening to think someone could do that,” adding that she often saw the three children playing in the front yard.

Maria Manfredini, who also lived in the neighborhood, told the newspaper that the tragic deaths have shaken the community.

“It’s just horrific on every level,” she added. “This is a very close community. It’s always been so calm and peaceful. We never would’ve expected anything like this at all. I’m still in shock. I’m deeply saddened by what’s happened.”

The tragedy comes just months after a family of seven perished in a murder suicide in the village of Osmington in southwest Australia in May. Authorities said it was the country’s worst mass murder in more than two decades.",world
"Lethal injection, which became the death penalty method of choice after the electric chair was deemed too cruel, is now falling out of favor.

Drug companies are rebelling against it. States are fighting to keep it. And there is a new wave of controversy – and a slew of lawsuits – alleging that lethal injections are almost as inhumane as firing squads.

Now the future of legal injection is uncertain, and states find themselves looking for alternatives.

There are 31 states that currently allow the death penalty, with lethal injection being the primary method to carry out the practice. In recent years, many of those states have faced drug shortages due to manufacturers cutting off the supply due to objections over how their drugs are used.

Robert Dunham, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Death Penalty Information Center says he’s not surprised that drug supplies are being cut off.

“In every state that’s attempting to carry out executions, prisoners have been challenging the method of execution. And those challenges have either been to the entire state’s protocol where they are attacking the use of particular drugs, or it’s been what’s called an as-applied challenge when people who have particular medical conditions say that the use of any kind of lethal injection is inappropriate for them because of the way they’re likely to respond.”

Several states including Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Nebraska, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas have recently faced court challenges or inquires over lethal injection protocols, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. A judge in Tennessee recently granted the state permission to begin using a new cocktail of drugs to carry out executions.

Some states have even gone further to enact secrecy laws to protect the source of acquired drugs.

“All of the states that have been carrying out executions have some form of secrecy...” Dunham said. “The states initially said that this is necessary for them to obtain the drugs because drug manufacturers were being harassed, they claimed, by anti-death penalty advocates. Those allegations have all turned out to be false. But the states have continued to attempt to expand secrecy and the real reason is because the drug manufacturers themselves are opposed to the use of their medicines in executions.”

Drug manufactures such as Pfizer, Athenex, Akorn, Roche, Janssen and others have put out statements opposing the use of their products in executions. In 2016, Pfizer started imposing controls over its medicines to make sure they would not be used for lethal injection.

Drugs like Midazolam and Pentobarbital have been affected by companies unwilling to sell their products to states. Midazolam was at the center of controversy after a botched attempted execution of an Oklahoma inmate in 2014. The drug was also part of an intense execution schedule and method carried out by the state of Arkansas last year.

Dunham also discussed a February 2017 attempted execution involving an Alabama inmate where the man was stuck about 12 times in order to find a usable vein. The prisoner’s attorney said the man’s bladder may have been punctured during the attempt.

In a more recent case, the United States Supreme Court stayed the execution of Missouri death row inmate Russell Bucklew. Bucklew has cavernous hemangioma, which includes symptoms such as weak blood vessels and blood-filled tumors in the throat and nose.

One doctor and professor of medicine says the act of lethal injection is often confused for a medical procedure.

“These are the sorts of medications that doctors use and how these medications are used for the purposes of execution, that’s not really a doctor’s job,” said Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. “That’s the state taking these sorts of medications and repurposing them as poison. In my hand, these are used to treat diseases and in the state’s hand the same compounds are now used to kill.”

Zivot strongly stated that he’s not an advocate or opponent of the death penalty itself but rather a campaigner for the elimination of the field of medicine from the entire process of executing criminals. He noted how some instances of the practice could violate the Eight Amendment. Zivot is not alone, the American Board of Anesthesiology and the American Medical Association forbid members from participating in executions.

Some states have sought different executions methods if lethal injection drugs are not available. Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi all have laws that allow the use of death by nitrogen hypoxia, or gas chamber. Tennessee allows the use of the electric chair while Utah has passed a law allowing death by firing squad if the state is unable to obtain the proper drugs. New Hampshire allows inmates to be executed by hanging if it becomes impractical to carry out a death sentence by injection.

Criminal defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant said states may have to go as far as producing their own drugs to carry out the death penalty. Merchant went even further to say that death by lethal injection could come to a stop.

“I do think this issue could go to the Supreme Court, ultimately, but it’s a very interesting issue that the courts are probably not going to be able to resolve because what we’ve got is independent drug manufacturers who are refusing to make the drugs unless the state says they’re not going to use them for executions,” Merchant said. “Now we’ve got drug companies that say we don’t’ believe in the death penalty and they can’t be forced to produce drugs that are going to be used in executions. So they’re really exercising their right to free speech and their belief system and that may put an end to this type of execution.”

Merchant said death penalty procedures like the electric chair and hanging became obsolete with societal pressures.

“I think it’s more than just the individual inmate’s rights. I think it’s us as a society because the Supreme Court said that we can have the death penalty but it has to be judged by an evolving standard of decency,” she said. “Yes, we want finality in these sentences but is there a way to do that without violating the Eighth Amendment and without being cruel and unusual and we just haven’t been able to find a method that society is OK with.”",world
"Two poachers have been killed during coordinated raids by armed rangers in Kruger National Park in South Africa.

Two sets of freshly harvested rhino horn were seized during the 72-hour operation, but rangers have yet to locate the dead or dying animals slaughtered for their ivory.

Ten arrests were made, including a serving police officer from the park’s own station, after three separate gangs successfully were tracked over the weekend.

One poacher, who was shot and badly injured, remained in hospital under armed guard and the rest will appear in court this week.

Isaac Phaahla, the spokesman for the park, said that the arrests were “a great breakthrough in the relentless war.”

“Our patrols risk their lives every day as they battle with the poachers who just keep coming back and back,” he said. “The war is relentless, the task is huge, nonstop and dangerous. The poachers are heavily armed, determined and absolutely ruthless.”

Phaahla said that discovering one of the park’s police officers was among those arrested was heartbreaking. “It’s terrible when you are betrayed by one of your own,” he said.

Poachers were tracked for 10 hours by rangers on foot, in helicopters and an aircraft before a canine unit caught them, Phaahla said. The gang had crossed from Mozambique, one of the world’s poorest countries, which shares a 210 mile-long border with the park.

More than 500 mostly young Mozambicans have been killed by anti-poaching units over the past five years. Rangers are allowed to shoot at trespassers if they are threatened with lethal force.

"Toronto cops nabbed the suspected driver who plowed into a group of people on a crowded city street Monday afternoon, leaving 10 people dead and 15 others injured, Deputy Police Chief Peter Yuen said.

Police confirmed to Fox News the arrest of the suspect, which came just minutes after news of the incident broke. ""The van involved in multiple pedestrians stuck in the Yonge and Finch area of Toronto has been located and the driver arrested,"" Toronto police tweeted. The identity of the driver has not been released.

Cops had initially said eight to 10 people were hit near Yonge Street and Finch Avenue just before 1:30 p.m. A nearby hospital tweeted that it took in seven patients.

After striking the pedestrians, the driver sped off, CBC reported. Witnesses said the driver was moving fast and appeared to be acting deliberately, but police said they did not yet know the cause or any possible motive.

Photos from the site of the collision showed pedestrians attempting to help people on the ground and multiple bodies covered by sheets.

A witness who identified himself as Nick said he was studying when he saw a truck “flash by” in the area. He said he “witnessed a few people pass away in front” of him as others screamed.

“[The driver] was definitely in control of what he was doing…he knew what he was doing,” Nick told Global News.

Alex Shaker, who witnessed the incident, said the van was speeding down the street before it mounted the curb and plowed into people.

“He started going down on the sidewalk and crumbling down people one by one,” Shaker told CTV. “He just destroyed so many people’s lives. Every single thing that got in his way.”

A worker at a gym in a building next to the site of the incident told Fox News that employees were told to stay inside as first responders tended to the scene.

“Ryder is aware of an incident involving a Ryder rental van striking pedestrians in Toronto on Monday April 23rd in the early afternoon,” the rental company told Fox News. “We are saddened by this tragic event, and our deepest sympathies go out to those impacted. We take the safety and security of our entire fleet very seriously and we are cooperating fully with authorities.”

“Our thoughts are with all those affected by the terrible incident at Yonge and Finch in Toronto,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted. “Thank you to the first responders working at the scene – we're monitoring the situation closely.”

“We are all unsettled and disturbed,” Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, told reporters, emphasizing that she was awaiting further details. “We have to wait until there is information before we start talking,” she said. “As details are available and as it is appropriate, then that information will be made public.”

Ralph Goodale, Canada's minister of public safety, said the country hasn't changed its terrorism alert level and he has no information that would suggest a need to do so.

""Investigators are appealing for information from the public,"" Toronto police said, adding that a hotline for witnesses will be announced later Monday.

""This is a time when this community should come together,"" Toronto Mayor John Tory said at an afternoon press conference. ""I hope that we will, as a city, remind ourselves of the fact that we are admired around the world for being inclusive and for being accepting and understanding and considerate.""

The crash unfolded as Cabinet ministers from the G7 countries were gathered in Toronto to discuss a range of international issues in the run-up to the G7 meeting near Quebec City in June.

Speaking at the event on Monday, Chrystia Freeland, Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, expressed ""sadness and tremendous sympathy for the victims of this incident.""

Investigators are expected to remain on the scene for several days.

"When you watch or read a news story about the Middle East, it’s often about violence and hatred – Palestinians vs. Israelis, the civil wars in Syria and Yemen, fighting in Iraq, terrorist attacks in Egypt and more. But there’s an oasis of peace and love in Jerusalem where religious, ethnic and national disputes are nonexistent. And I was just there.

The oasis is called the Shalva National Center. Shalva – the Hebrew word for serenity – is the Israel Association for the Care and Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities. It serves about 2,000 people with disabilities (primarily children), from birth to adulthood every week and has served thousands more over the years. Shalva is the Middle East’s largest facility for children with disabilities.

Shalva serves Israelis and Arabs, Jews, Muslims, Druze and Christians – all free of charge, without regard for their religion or citizenship.

And if you’ve never been to Jerusalem, I don’t know what’s holding you back. You’re probably safer there than you are in most American cities.

One of the most powerful things I saw during my recent tour of Shalva on a fundraising trip for the center was the parenting groups. Parents from many backgrounds and many nations in the Middle East were together in the same rooms – unaffected by the deep divisions of the region – drawn together by the fact that all of their children have the special needs that Shalva is helping to meet.

It’s sad that it takes a special needs child to bring adults together like this. But maybe God‘s plan is bigger than something I can understand.

And I also saw the internationally famous Shalva Band, which is made up of eight young musicians with disabilities. The band has two blind lead singers, backed by musicians with Down syndrome, Williams syndrome, cerebral palsy, pervasive developmental disorders and other conditions.

One of the blind singers, Anael Khalifa, does a rendition of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” that will rip your heart out. It’s heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time, because the song is all about imagery that she will never see with her own eyes.

I saw the Shalva Band perform and participate in a panel on living life to the fullest regardless of disability during my visit to Shalva. I was part of a group of 630 high school students, chaperones, and dozens of adults from the U.S., Canada and Britain taking part in fundraising races – a marathon, half marathon, or 10K – to raise money for Shalva.

Shalva does great work and changes lives. Some Middle Eastern countries have no facilities at all for children with special needs. For example, Shalva recently provided early intervention assistance for a boy from Iraq for open-heart surgery. In war-torn Iraq, there are virtually no services for children with disabilities.

While the boy was recuperating from surgery, he attended Shalva for therapy on a biweekly basis. Shalva therapists also trained his caretakers to continue the therapy and provided them with the specialized clothes and toys that will help with his development.

To raise money for Shalva, I ran the Jerusalem half marathon on a Friday morning for Team Shalva. The race started at 6:45 a.m. Running for a few hours while my body clock was screaming “go to bed already!” because of the time difference between the U.S. East Coast and Israel wasn’t easy. But I finished the race, aided by lovely, low 60s weather and the encouragement of the Jerusalemites up early along the route.



I was impressed by Shalva’s new 200,000 square-foot, nine-story facility, complete with Olympic swimming pool, full-size basketball courts, and bedrooms. Why bedrooms? So that the kids Shalva serves can spend the night there once a week with their friends and favorite counselors, giving their harried parents a well-deserved weekly date night.



Jerusalem is all hills, which means the race is relentlessly up-and-down, up-and-down, clambering over the same hills where King David, the prophet Samuel, and Jesus once walked. And without the aid of water stations along their routes.



The route dips briefly behind the walls of the Old City and comes within a few hundred yards of the Western Wall, Judaism’s holiest site. As a longtime visitor to Israel, and having gone to a Jewish seminary in Jerusalem years earlier, these paths were familiar to me. I also saw parts of the city I had never seen, and ran through neighborhoods I thought I knew, but know better now, because of the race.



This October, Shalva will conduct another fundraiser – participants will head to Africa to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. Count me in, and you can join me.



And if you’ve never been to Jerusalem, I don’t know what’s holding you back. You’re probably safer there than you are in most American cities. You can go any time, or you can get involved with Shalva and run in Jerusalem next fall.



And if you’ve never heard a blind girl singing “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” backed by a rockin’ band of young people with disabilities, you have no idea what you’re missing.",world
"An Israeli teen visiting Yosemite National Park fell to his death Wednesday while trying to take a selfie, a report said.

Tomer Frankfurter, 18, a resident of Jerusalem, had been on a two-month trip to the United States when he died, according to Israeli news reports. He apparently died after plunging more than 800 feet after he slipped off a cliff, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.

"The Iranian Embassy in Paris was damaged Friday by a group of people that a local police official says was made up of ""individuals"" and Iran's Foreign Ministry has accused of being extremists Saturday while complaining of an allegedly slow and weak response from law enforcement in the French capital.

Iran's Foreign Ministry said protesters tried to attack embassy, the country's official IRNA news agency reported. IRNA quoted ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi saying officers did not arrive quickly after the disturbance was reported.

He said the troublemakers were members of an extremist organization he did not identify, IRNA said.

""It is necessary for the French government to take serious measures to protect Iranian diplomatic missions in that country,"" Ghasemi said, according to the news agency.

A Paris police spokeswoman gave a somewhat different version Saturday of what transpired on Friday afternoon, when she said ""individuals"" threw objects and smashed windows at the embassy.

The spokeswoman said the responding officers searched 12 people, but didn't take anyone into custody because embassy personnel didn't want to file a complaint. She provided information about the incident but would not give her name, a common police practice in France.

Ghasemi said some suspects were arrested and Iran has asked the French government to prosecute and punish them, IRNA reported. Tehran is doing its own investigation of the commotion and the allegedly tardy arrival of Paris police, the news agency said.

The Paris police spokesman said she did not have information about the motives or identities of the people outside the embassy.

Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard last week claimed responsibility for a missile attack targeting an Iraqi base of Kurdish separatist group Party of Democratic Kurdistan of Iran. The Revolutionary Guard said the attack killed at least 11 people and wounded 50.

"“Daddy, where is God during the hurricane?”

This is the question my five-year-old son asked me yesterday. We were huddled together on the porch with my wife Lauren and our two daughters, watching the pine trees in our back yard being whipped around by the wind.

It’s a good question.

If God is as good and as powerful as the Bible says he is, then why would he allow a hurricane like Florence to devastate the Carolina coast, where it has taken the lives of at least seven people already and made thousands of other people homeless? Where is God during the hurricane?

Lauren and I struggled to give a response that would satisfy the curiosity of a five-year-old. But as difficult as it is to grapple with the existence of natural evils, there are some lessons we can all learn in the midst of their devastation.

While natural disasters bring tragedy, they also can bring out the best in humanity.

The first is that God does not delight in disaster. When God created the world, he ordered it in such a way that human beings could flourish. The Bible’s creation account repeatedly refers to the world as “good” and “very good.” And at the time of creation, human beings had a perfect relationship with God, with each other, and with the world around them.

It was not God who broke this perfect paradise, but humans. Through the sin of Adam and Eve—a sin in which we all share—evil unthinkable was unleashed upon our world. Even the natural world was poisoned by this first rebellion, transforming from a place of peace into a realm of danger.

A second lesson Florence may teach us is of the greatness of God. Even as we stand in awe of the overwhelming power of hurricane-force winds and deluges of water, we should remember that there is nothing more powerful than God and his words. God created the wind and the waves.

As Jesus demonstrated when he lived among us, the wind and waves still obey his voice. The disciples of Jesus were not warmed and comforted by this fact. They saw in Jesus a power more astounding than a hurricane, and it led them to a more profound fear (cf. Mark 4:41). When we stand before the power of the storm, we should let our feelings of fear and awe remind us of our dependence on God.

Third, while natural disasters bring tragedy, they also can bring out the best in humanity. We’ve already heard several stories of heroism and sacrifice during Hurricane Florence. On Saturday morning, we learned of rescuers who risked their lives to trying to save a family trapped underneath a fallen tree and collapsed roof. On Saturday afternoon, there were reports that thousands of volunteers—through organizations such as Samaritan’s Purse and North Carolina Baptist Disaster Relief—have joined emergency teams to provide medical assistance, makeshift shelters, and hot meals for victims of the disaster. Thousands of other stories of bravery and compassion will be written in the days to come.

Fourth, in light of such acts of love and courage, a hurricane such as Florence could be a catalyst to bring some healing to our deeply divided nation. In the midst of the gale-force winds and surging water, Americans of every political stripe are working together to rescue the trapped, heal the wounded, and feed the hungry. As a country, we are never greater than when we respond to disaster with unity. And we can only hope that, once the wind and rain have ceased, we can find a way to reach across the aisle to bring some healing to our social, cultural, and political wounds.

In the end, the most powerful answer to, “Where is God in the midst of Hurricane Florence?” is, “He is right here with us.” As I tried to explain to my small children, God entered the suffering of our world on a mission to end it. Not only is he familiar with tragedy and loss, but he willingly laid down his life to put evil to death forever. Jesus’ death on the cross proves the lengths he will go to identify with us in our suffering. And his resurrection provides a down payment on his promise to return one day to put an end to suffering once-and-for all.

In the meantime, before he returns, these evils offer us an opportunity to respond to the needs of our world with courage, faith, and love. And that is something that even a five-year-old can understand.",world

The shine is starting to come off South Korean President Moon Jae-in's engagement strategy with the North.

The liberal politician, who reversed nearly a decade of conservative hard-line policy toward North Korea after his election last year, is preparing for a third summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un amid growing public skepticism about his approach.

Moon, who goes to Pyongyang on Tuesday, has seen his approval rating fall to 49 percent in a recent Gallup Korea survey, the first time it dipped below 50 percent since he took office in May 2017 promising better ties with North Korea and political reform. Moon's approval rating stood at 83 percent after his first summit with Kim in April.

South Koreans are divided over whether this week's summit in Pyongyang will help break a stalemate over nuclear diplomacy between the U.S. and North Korea, according to another survey released in early September. By comparison, surveys after the April summit found overwhelming support for Moon from a public fascinated with the historic handshakes, border crossings and other dramatic scenes the two leaders produced after years of rising tensions.

""Our people are beginning to learn that North Korea will not easily give up its nukes, something that many experts had already repeatedly predicted,"" said Kim Taewoo, former president of the government-funded Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.

Moon may face increasing difficulties if his summit with Kim in Pyongyang fails to make tangible progress on efforts to get North Korea to scrap its nuclear weapons program.

Economic woes such as a lackluster job-market growth and soaring real estate prices are compounding Moon's problems, adding to opposition to his North Korea policy, many experts say.

""If Moon fails to address economic problems, he can't maintain public contentment with his government only with his North Korea policy,"" said Nam Sung-wook, a professor at Korea University. ""If the economy gets worse, many people will demand that Moon stop looking to North Korea and start resolving our own economic problems.""

Moon knows how important public support is for his North Korea policy. Most major detente projects with North Korea started by his liberal predecessors during a 1998-2008 ""Sunshine Era"" were suspended after conservatives took power. Moon hasn't been able to revive them because of U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea.

Liberal presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun endured withering conservative criticism that their little-strings-attached shipments of aid and cooperation projects with North Korea helped finance the North's weapons program. Moon served as Roh's chief of staff and was in charge of preparations for Roh's 2007 summit with Kim's father, former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.

South Korean politics is characterized by a fundamental conservative-liberal divide over how to view North Korea. Liberals consider the North one to reconcile with while conservatives see it more as an enemy state that poses a significant security threat.

Moon's conservative predecessors, Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak, faced harsh criticism from liberals that their hard-line stances only led North Korea to carry out more weapons tests and attacks such as two in 2010 that killed 50 South Koreans.

Opposition to Moon's North Korea policy was initially weak, partly because the conservatives were in disarray following a corruption scandal that led to the ouster of Park, Moon's predecessor.

A conservative backlash erupted when Kim sent North Korean athletes and top officials to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea in February, including a former spy chief blamed for the 2010 attacks. But any criticism was soon overshadowed by the April summit, which also improved Kim's image in South Korea — in one survey at the time, 78 percent of respondents said they had faith in the North Korean leader.

Now, as nuclear talks between the U.S. and North Korea stall, conservatives feel vindicated and emboldened.

Professor Lim Eul Chul at South Korea's Kyungnam University said conservatives now ""tend to criticize North Korea and distance themselves from the Moon government for their own political gain.""

During a Cabinet meeting last week, Moon said he needs not only strong international support but also ""nonpartisan backing at home"" to help make next week's summit produce a major step toward denuclearization. ""Please, lay aside partisan politics in the face of these kinds of important things for Korea,"" he said.

Moon even asked conservative opposition leaders to travel with him to Pyongyang for the summit, but they rejected the offer immediately.

""Given that North Korea has not taken concrete denuclearization steps even after two inter-Korean summits and one U.S.-North Korea summit, it's overly excessive to ask us to go to Pyongyang,"" said Yoon Young-seok, a spokesman for the main opposition Liberty Korea Party. ""We can't help asking whether the invitation ... is aimed at giving Kim Jong Un a gift.""
