A military judge in South Sudan on Thursday sentenced 10 soldiers to jail for a 2016 rampage in which a local journalist was killed and five international aid workers were gang-raped.

The case was widely seen as a test of South Sudan's ability to hold its soldiers to account during the five-year civil war here, and diplomats and activists welcomed the outcome. However, they said many other victims of violations have yet to see justice and urged the government to hold more trials.

Brig. Gen. Knight Briano convicted and sentenced two soldiers to life in prison for the murder of a South Sudanese journalist. The judge found three other soldiers guilty of raping foreign aid workers, four guilty of sexual harassment and one guilty of theft and armed robbery. They received sentences ranging from seven to 14 years in jail.

Another soldier was acquitted for lack of evidence. Still another accused soldier died in jail during the trial.

The convicted soldiers were stripped of their uniforms before being transported by truck to prison.

In July 2016, dozens of soldiers broke into the Terrain Hotel compound in Juba and began their rampage, while U.N. peacekeepers nearby did not respond to pleas for help. An investigation by the Associated Press in 2016 revealed the extent of the crimes and spurred the South Sudanese government and the United Nations to investigate.

The army hopes the trial will act as a deterrent to other soldiers while reassuring civilians that anyone who commits a crime will be punished, army spokesman Col. Domic Chol Santo told AP.

""This is important because the army has been accused of a great deal of rape, sexual harassment and all forms of violations, and it's not part of our doctrine,"" said Santo.

The judge ordered $2 million to be paid to the Terrain Hotel for damages, $4,000 to each of five rape victims, $1,000 to an aid worker who was shot in the leg and 51 cattle to the family of the journalist who was killed (each cattle is worth roughly $600).

Many were pleased by the verdicts.

""I am very happy! I won...we won...women won!"" exclaimed a rape victim who had returned to South Sudan to testify in the trial. ""It is important to fight for our rights and never give up. We women have to still continue to fight for our rights that still in 2018 are trampled.""

The woman said she is ""happy for all women in South Sudan and other parts of the world who don't have voice. This trial can be a precedent for rape as war crimes."" AP does not identify victims of sexual assault.

""The process was far from perfect, but shows that justice can be done where there is political will to do so,"" said Jehanne Henry, associate director in Africa for Human Rights Watch. She said the case shows ""how far South Sudan has to go to provide real justice and accountability for atrocities committed in this war.""

France's ambassador to South Sudan, Jean-Yves Roux, said he hopes the verdict sends a message that violence and impunity are not ""business as usual, and that this trial opens the way for other trials.""

Some observers had criticized the fact that only low-ranked soldiers were tried, but their commanders were not.

""We continue to push for commanders to be held responsible and not only for the low-level people to be picked on,"" said Andrew Clapham of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan.

""That's the only way we're going to be able to prevent things in the future — if the commanders feel that there is some accountability and punishment,"" he said.

"Police in the Dutch capital shot and wounded a suspect Friday after he stabbed two people at Amsterdam's busy central railway station.

Hours after the incident, police said they were still investigating a possible motive for the attack and weren't excluding any possible scenarios.

Police spokesman Rob van der Veen said the violence happened shortly after noon (1000 GMT; 6 a.m. EDT) at the busy Central Station in downtown Amsterdam when a man walked into a group of people.

""Something happened, we don't know yet what, but during that two people were stabbed and one person with a knife in his hand walked away and he was shot by police,"" Van der Veen said.

All three people were taken to a hospital. Police didn't release details about their conditions.

Van der Veen said forensics experts were still combing the scene hours after the attack and detectives were investigating the man's motive.

Two platforms were temporarily closed to train traffic, but the station wasn't evacuated. Trams to and from the square in front of the station were stopped as police and emergency services converged on the area. Red and white police tape kept members of the public away from the scene.

Central Station is a busy entry and exit point for visitors to the Dutch capital, with regular trains linking it to the city's Schiphol Airport. Friday is one of the busiest days of the week, with many tourists arriving for the weekend.",world
"President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani slammed as an ""idiot"" a New York Times reporter during an interview Sunday on Fox News' ""Media Buzz,"" saying it should be apparent that even honest clients run a major risk of falling into a so-called perjury trap if they agree to meet with federal investigators.



The Times' Nicholas Confessore argued on MSNBC this week that Giuliani's concerns that Trump might be charged with lying to investigators if he met with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team revealed that ""the president's story is wrong, it's a lie.""



Giuliani unloaded on Confessore, saying prosecutors often aggressively pursue perjury charges even where the underlying truth of the matter involved is unresolved, and that it would be ""malpractice"" to ignore that threat.



""I don't know if he's deliberately being like that or if he's a complete moron, Giuliani said. ""The reality is, you can be accused of perjury when you're telling the absolute truth. Let me give you an example for that idiot -- which I attribute, really, to the malice of the New York Times.""



Giuliani then offered an extended hypothetical to illustrate his point.

WATCH: GIULIANI TELLS HANNITY MUELLER PROBE IS NOT LEGITIMATE



""I didn't come to your house last night,"" Giuliani said to host Howard Kurtz, by way of example. ""You're lying, and you say I did come to your house. They put me under oath and I say, I didn't come to Howie's house last night. But they elect to believe Howie, even though Howie lied about it twice. I have no control over that. That's what they did to Martha Stewart. And since that case, all of us lawyers have been very careful.""

In 2004, Stewart was convicted of conspiracy, obstruction and perjury charges after a judge threw out the securities fraud case against her, which was widely considered the more substantial legal issue. And former MLB superstar Barry Bonds was convicted of obstruction of justice for allegedly giving an incomplete answer on a grand jury questionnaire, but that conviction was overturned in 2015.

Both episodes have been cited as high-profile examples of so-called perjury traps, in which prosecutors secure convictions for lying or telling half-truths without being able to prove any underlying offense.

Giuliani said the hypothetical was similar to the questions surrounding Trump's purported conversation with former FBI Director James Comey concerning National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

Giuliani said Sunday that Trump would testify that he did not speak to Comey specifically about giving Flynn a ""break"" for the purpose of obstructing the Russia probe, which matches Comey's sworn testimony. But, Giuliani suggested, that hypothetical Trump testimony could still be contested at trial by Comey or others, leading to a plausible prosecution for perjury.



Despite ""hysterical"" media coverage, Giuliani said he still expects the Mueller probe to wind down by September.



Giuliani added that many in the media don't fully understand how to follow the Trump team's legal arguments, which he said often involve hypothetical situations that are not intended to be admissions of guilt. Giuliani's comments earlier this year that the president legally might be able to pardon himself were widely interpreted as a suggestion that Trump was seriously considering the possibility.

Still, despite what he characterized as unfair coverage, Giuliani said it's necessary to address the Mueller probe in the court of public opinion by continuing to make regular media appearances. He compared the public to ""our grand jury.""

""The reality is, this is not a court case,"" Giuliani said. ""The president can't be indicted. They've acknowledged that.""

"California lawmakers approved a bill this week that would expand the list of people who could ask a court for a gun violence restraining order, reports said.

AB2888 passed the state Senate 25-12. It would allow co-workers and school personnel to petition a court to temporarily remove guns from someone they believe poses a danger, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The legislation would build on the state's existing ""red flag"" law, passed in 2014 following a deadly shooting in Isla Vista that resulted in seven deaths, including the shooter, the Huffington Post reported. The law went into effect in 2016.

But critics say that expanding the gun-takeaway law could lead to abuses, the Chronicle reported.

""It is very dangerous when you go after someone's liberty for some perceived security,"" Craig DeLuz of the Firearms Policy Coalition told Sacramento's KCRA-TV.

""It is very dangerous when you go after someone's liberty for some perceived security."" - Craig DeLuz, Firearms Policy Coalition

""We all want to do what we can to make sure we keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who can potentially be a danger to themselves or others,"" he said. ""But in any case, we must always be careful of violating civil liberties.""

Currently, the red flag law can be used only by immediate family members, roommates and law enforcement, according to reports.

The expansion bill sponsored by Assemblyman Phil Ting, D-San Francisco, now heads to Gov. Jerry Brown, who vetoed a similar proposal in 2016, one that Ting filed following a mass shooting in San Bernardino, the Huffington Post reported.

Brown said then it was “premature to enact a further expansion,"" the report said. It was not immediately clear whether the governor would sign the latest bill, according to the Chronicle.

“This is about getting guns out of the hands of the wrong people,"" Ting said.

“This is about getting guns out of the hands of the wrong people."" - Assemblyman Phil Ting, D-San Francisco

Under the bill, a judge could bar a person from possessing a gun for as long as a year, the report said.

In a tweet, Ting called it ""another tool to protect communities.""

Right now, if a judge grants a restraining order, ""the gun owner is required to surrender his or her firearms for 21 days while awaiting a hearing on whether the order will be extended for a year,"" the Chronicle reported. The person would be barred from buying firearms or ammunition during that time.

“We’re grappling with this issue of gun violence as a nation,” Ting told the Post. “I’ve never said this is a panacea, but it’s just one of many solutions we have to offer.”

The assemblyman said his bill would provide additional opportunities to catch troubling behavior.

""You don't have to increase the restrictions on people in general to get firearms away, but actually be able to do something that targets dangerous people,"" Amy Barnhorst, a psychiatrist at the University of California at Davis, told Sacramento's KCRA-TV.

“If you can just stop people at that point where they try to get a gun they can't become mass shooters,"" she said.",politics
"Lanny Davis, the attorney for President Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen, said Tuesday that his client is “more than happy” to tell Special Counsel Robert Mueller “all that he knows.”

Cohen pleaded guilty Tuesday to campaign-finance violations and other charges. He said Trump directed him to arrange the payments of hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal to fend off damage to his 2016 White House bid.

In entering the plea, Cohen did not specifically name the two women or even Trump, recounting instead that he worked with an “unnamed candidate.” But the amounts and the dates all lined up with the payments made to Daniels and McDougal.

Harmeet Dhillon, an attorney and Republican National committeewoman in California, said Davis appeared to sell his client out because she believes it is a ""real stretch"" to say that someone who is paying off hush money to a blackmailer is trying to affect the outcome of an election.

Cohen could have received up to 65 years in prison if convicted of all charges. However, as part of his plea deal, Cohen agreed not to challenge any sentence between 46 and 63 months. The deal does not involve a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors.

Cohen’s plea follows months of scrutiny from federal investigations and a falling-out with the president, for whom Cohen once said he would “take a bullet.”

Davis told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Tuesday that Cohen has knowledge that would be “of interest” to the Mueller investigation. He mentioned the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016. The meeting is key to Mueller’s probe into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign figures, including Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, attended the meeting.

The Trump team maintains that the meeting failed to yield compromising information on Clinton, Trump’s Democratic opponent.

“The obvious possibility [exists] of a conspiracy to collude and corrupt the American democracy system in the 2016 election, which the Trump Tower meeting was all about,” Davis said. “But also [there's the possibility of] knowledge about the computer crime of hacking and whether or not Mr. Trump knew ahead of time about that crime and cheered it on.”

Twelve Russian military intelligence officers hacked into the Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic Party and released tens of thousands of private communications in a sweeping conspiracy by the Kremlin to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election.

The 29-page indictment lays out how, months before Americans went to the polls, Russians schemed to break into key Democratic email accounts, including those belonging to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Stolen emails, many politically damaging for Clinton, appeared on WikiLeaks in the campaign’s final stretch.

Davis had said that the Cohen’s plea showed Trump committed a crime.

Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, noted in a statement that “there is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president in the government’s charges against Mr. Cohen.”

Daniel Petalas, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department’s public integrity section, said, “This brings President Trump closer into the criminal conduct.”

“The president has certain protections while a sitting president, but if it were true, and he was aware and tried to influence an election, that could be a federal felony offense,” Petalas said. “This strikes close to home.”

"New York Socialist Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez once blamed ride-sharing giant Uber for leading a yellow cab driver to suicide. Her campaign then took $4,000 worth of Uber rides.

But Ocasio-Cortez, who rose to prominence after defeating top Democrat Joe Crowley in the party’s U.S. House primary in June, is no fan of Uber, if you read her statements on social media.

She frequently criticized the ride-hailing company for what she sees as underpaying its drivers, decrying their pay as “exploitation” if they don’t get at least $15 an hour, the so-called living wage.

She directly blamed the company for the suicide death of Doug Schifter, a driver in his 60s, who killed himself with a shotgun amid financial difficulties caused by flooding the streets of New York with alternative and cheaper options of taxis, as detailed in a lengthy Facebook post.

“NYC's fourth driver suicide. Yellow cab drivers are in financial ruin due to the unregulated expansion of Uber. What was a living wage job now pays under minimum,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote.

That was in March, months before the New York socialist, who recently lamented the closing down of a coffee shop over minimum wage hikes that she supports, became the new face of the progressive Democratic Party.

But between April and late June, the Ocasio-Cortez campaign recorded spending nearly $4,000 on Uber for what appears to be 160 rides by its staff, Federal Election Commission (FEC) records reveal.

The payments to California-based Uber ranged from just 59 cents to $82.26 and were filed under “car service.” There’s no data yet for the months of July and August.

Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign does use a New York-based company for travel, but it's not the traditional yellow cabs that receive the money.

The FEC records show that the campaign spent nearly $2,500 for more than 90 rides with the so-called ride-sharing startup company Juno that pitched itself as an alternative to Uber for drivers as it offered slightly better pay and an option to accumulate the company’s stock. There’s no data yet for any rides taken by the Ocasio-Cortez campaign between in July and August.

But the “driver-friendly” startup is barely any better for drivers than other ride-sharing companies. It was sold in April to Israel-based Gett for $200 million and immediately came under fire for scrapping the stock unit program for its drivers.

This prompted a class action by Juno drivers. “Plaintiffs were victims of the classic ‘bait and switch’ scheme – promised equity and then paid off at pennies on the dollar when all other shareholders/investors made out handsomely,” the suit reads.

The Ocasio-Cortez campaign didn’t immediately respond to Fox News’ questions about why the campaign doesn’t use traditional yellow cabs in New York or California, and whether it will stop using ride-hailing applications such as Uber or Juno.",politics

For his last time, Japan's Emperor Akihito addressed a memorial service Wednesday marking the end of World War II. Once again, he expressed ""deep remorse"" for the war.

It was in keeping with what by all appearances has become a mission for Akihito over his 30-year reign: to make amends for a war fought in the name of his father, Hirohito. The 84-year-old monarch is set to abdicate next spring.

""Reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never be repeated,"" Akihito said in a two-minute speech on the 73rd anniversary of Japan's surrender.

As emperor, he has made unprecedented visits to the Philippines and other Pacific islands conquered by Japan early in World War II and devastated in fierce fighting as the U.S.-led allies took them back. Though Akihito has avoided a direct apology, he has subtly stepped up his expressions of regret in recent years in carefully scripted statements on the war.

His words have taken on greater importance as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has sought to move Japan beyond its troubled past since coming to power in December 2012. Opponents of Abe's policies have grabbed onto the emperor's statements as a counterbalance to the prime minister's push to revise Japan's war-renouncing constitution and build up its military.

Akihito's World War II-related trips and pronouncements form part of a broader effort to bring the royal family closer to the public. In so doing, he has won over pacifists, leftists and other critics of the emperor system in a way his father was never able to do.

Hirohito, who was worshipped as a living god until the end of the war, remains a controversial figure even today, with historians still debating his responsibility for the war.

During his father's reign, Akihito himself was almost hit by a Molotov cocktail on a 1975 visit to Japan's southern Okinawa island, where tens of thousands of civilians died in intense fighting near the end of World War II.

He has since visited the island 10 times. Okinawans warmly welcomed him and his wife Michiko earlier this year in what was likely his last as emperor.

Akihito was 11 years old when he heard his father's voice announcing Japan's surrender on the radio on Aug. 15, 1945. During the subsequent U.S. occupation of Japan, he was tutored in English by Elizabeth Vining, a Quaker, an experience that experts say gave Akihito his pacifist and democratic outlook.

Though Hirohito hardly changed the wording of his Aug. 15 message for a quarter century, Akihito's has evolved since he became emperor after his father's death in 1989.

On the 50th anniversary of the war's end in 1995, he expressed for the first time the hope that the same tragedy would never be repeated.

The same year, then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama acknowledged Japan's wartime aggression and made a landmark apology to victims in the rest of Asia.

His successors expressed remorse to other Asian countries until Abe dropped them and any reference to aggression in his Aug. 15 remarks beginning in 2013. He has pledged that Japan will not repeat the devastation of war, and did again Wednesday.

Abe also sent a religious offering to a Tokyo shrine that honors the war dead, including convicted war criminals. He has avoided visiting the shrine since 2013 in a bid to avoid overly angering China and South Korea, which see the Yasukuni shrine as a symbol of Japan's military aggression.

In his 70th anniversary address in 2015, Akihito started using the expression he used Wednesday, stronger words than he had used previously.

The contrast with Abe captured media attention, with the prime minister portrayed as a nationalist pushing for a stronger military versus a pacifist Akihito. Abe wants Japan to stop dwelling on the past, while the emperor doesn't want his country to forget it.

Akihito visited China early in his reign and has traveled to some of the harshest World War II battlefields in the Pacific. His 1995 visit to the U.S. territory of Saipan was hailed as a statement of his desire to be part of the postwar healing process. Akihito traveled to the western Pacific nation of Palau in 2015 and the Philippines in 2016.

While his Aug. 15 address is always short, Akihito has expressed his thoughts about the war more clearly in annual birthday remarks and on overseas trips. He has repeatedly stressed the importance of studying history and passing it down to the next generations.

""Now that the memories of the war have started to fade, I think it is extremely important for everyone to study time and again the course of history Japan has followed and to reflect on peace,"" he said in his 2011 birthday address.

His son, Crown Prince Naruhito, has largely echoed his father's pacifist stance, but it is unclear if the first postwar-generation emperor will be able to strike a similar chord with today's younger Japanese.

"If Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court wins approval from the U.S. Senate, he'll join a very exclusive club -- so exclusive, in fact, that he may feel almost anonymous.

That's because more than half of Americans cannot name a single member of the nation's highest court, according to a recent survey.

The C-SPAN/PBS survey, which questioned 1,000 likely voters between Aug. 13-15, found that 52 percent of Americans were unfamiliar with the current eight members of the court. (Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Samuel Alito, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Neil Gorsuch, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Clarence Thomas.)

Yet despite the shocking results, the survey marked an improvement over last year, when 57 percent of Americans couldn’t name a single Supreme Court justice.

The most identifiable justice, according to this year's poll, is Ginsburg, known to 25 percent of survey respondents. Interestingly, more men than women -- 26 percent to 24 percent -- could name the notorius RBG.

Generally, self-identified Democrats were better than Republicans at naming members of the court, with 48 percent of Dems able to name at least one justice versus 45 percent for GOPers.

Older people were also more likely to name a justice. The majority of adults age 50-64 and those age 65 and older were able to name a single court justice.

Gorsuch, who joined the court just last year, was recalled by a mere 6 percent of respondents, despite extensive media coverage of his nomination and confirmation.

As for Kavanaugh, President Trump’s pick to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy was known to 35 percent of respondents, but unknown to 60 percent.",politics

Jean-Pierre Vazart has more than a dozen weather apps on his phone. But the winemaker, who grows Chardonnay grapes in France's Champagne region, is still stressed out.

Temperatures have risen 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.16 F) in 30 years, and pickers are scrambling to bring in yet another early harvest. The specter of climate change is haunting the vineyards of France, and its creeping effects, including chaotic weather, are becoming the new normal.

For now, winemakers say they are benefiting from the warmer temperatures, with ripe grapes begging to be picked. But Vazart, 50, is worried a sudden hailstorm could devastate his succulent white grapes before the end of his 12-day harvest period, which began Monday. Rainstorms and hail compromised last year's less abundant Champagne harvest.

""The stress is with you ... until the last day,"" said Vazart from Chouilly, near Epernay, the epicenter of the Champagne region, which counts some 15,000 winegrowers.

It's the fifth time in 15 years that the harvest — traditionally a September ritual that can run into October — has started so early, according to Comite Champagne, which groups all industry players.

To counter the effects of global warming, scientists are planting the seeds of a small revolution in Champagne country: inseminating flowering grapes with pollen from lab plants to try to develop more weather-resistant varieties. If successful, the process would add to the seven authorized Champagne grape varieties — with Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Meunier mainly used — to create the crisp, bubbly Champagne with its perfect mellow notes.

Creating new grape varieties might once have been unthinkable in a land where each step of the Champagne-making process is rigidly codified. But grapes of the future — with new names but the taste of Champagne's ""terroir"" — are already being tested in three experimental vineyards. The projects, which began in 2014, may produce one or two new grape varieties, according to Arnaud Descotes, technical and environmental director of Comite Champagne.

He stressed that results won't be known for at least a decade, and the grapes would be rejected if blind taste tests fail to ensure the bubbly is not corrupted.

The Champagne region calls itself a pioneer of sustainable development, saying it's the first in the winegrowing world to measure its carbon footprint, which it said it reduced by 7 percent from 2003 to 2013. Officials are looking to lower greenhouse gases by 25 percent in 2025. Reducing the weight of the famously heavy Champagne bottles by 65 grams was among crucial measures.

The region isn't unique in its experimental drive. Elsewhere in France, researchers are also seeking ways to create heat-friendly grapes and protect the country's wine industry, both a multibillion dollar export market and part of the national identity.

In a taste-and-tell bid to show the effects of climate warming on the famed wines of Bordeaux, in southwest France, a noted oenologue, biologist and winegrower created ""2050,"" his wine of the future. Pascal Chatonnet assembled standard varieties used in Bordeaux wines but from the French Mediterranean region of Languedoc-Roussillon and the North African nation of Tunisia.

Tasted by the publication Science et Avenir, it was deemed drinkable but different, with tastes of red fruit but ""very ripe, a bit cooked, with a final short, chocolatey note."" Not Bordeaux.

For Vazart, optimism is essential.

""If we believed only the bad news, we'd change jobs now,"" he said.",world
"U.S. House members proved Thursday that they are more interested in political posturing and getting on TV with fiery soundbites than in fact-finding, as they questioned FBI official Peter Strzok about whether his anti-Trump bias influenced the investigation of the Trump presidential campaign for possible collusion with Russia.

Acting like they were cast members on a reality TV show – yelling, interrupting each other, and hurling insults – members of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees spent almost 10 hours alternately attacking and defending Strzok, a suspended FBI deputy assistant director.

The cable news networks televised the wild hearing, as Republicans led the attack on Strzok and Democrats defended him.

Strzok will likely be fired from the FBI in coming weeks for his disgraceful conduct at the agency, where he worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. He also headed the FBI team that investigated the email scandal surrounding Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Rather than getting a platform to speak to the nation in a daylong TV performance, Strzok should be summarily dismissed from the FBI, thoroughly investigated and prosecuted if the evidence shows he has broken the law.

Mueller removed Strzok from the Russia investigation last year after learning of numerous rabidly anti-Trump and pro-Clinton text messages that Strzok traded with his then-lover Lisa Page, who was an FBI lawyer at the time.

The texts made it crystal clear that Strzok and Page despised Donald Trump and wanted Hillary Clinton to defeat him in the 2016 presidential election.

In one text exchange, Page wrote to Strzok about Trump: “He’s not ever going to become president, right? Right?!” Strzok replied: “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.”

Strzok also said in a text that there was an unspecified “insurance policy” that would keep Trump out of the White House.

Strzok admitted at Thursday’s hearing that he “detested” Trump. However, he insisted vehemently and repeatedly that his personal political views had absolutely no impact on his conduct at the FBI in the investigations involving either the Trump campaign or Clinton. He said he had taken no improper action regarding either probe.

These claims are unbelievable and contradicted by the facts regarding Strzok’s conduct.

As an FBI agent for 24 years and former chief of all FBI criminal investigations, I was disgusted by the way Strzok tried to cloak himself in the FBI and characterize attacks against him as attacks against the FBI as an institution.

Strzok did his best to fuse himself to the good and dedicated men and women of the finest law enforcement agency in the world, but the truth is that his shabby conduct has done more to damage the FBI than any one person in its storied history.

Scores of current and retired FBI employees who gave their all to the organization have expressed to me that they deeply resent being unfairly forced to deal with the consequences of Strzok’s bad behavior.

For all the drama, fire and fury, the House hearing shed no new light on Strzok’s conduct at the FBI. It did, however, demonstrate the general uselessness of Congressional hearings.

Rather than uncover facts for their constituents, the hearing resembled a cross between “The People’s Court,” “The Jerry Springer Show,” and the trash talk between competitors at “WrestleMania.”

The sad truth is that in the Republicans’ zeal to administer a public flogging of Strzok – and by extension the FBI – the GOP House members walked right into a trap.

The hearing never had a chance of uncovering the truth. This is so because Strzok enjoyed the advantage of being able to shower the committees with self-serving protestations while hiding behind the restrictions on his testimony imposed by the FBI attorney hovering behind him.

Strzok understood this and exploited his opportunity to the hilt while snuggling up to the anti-Trump Democrats embracing him.

The savvy Strzok cleverly outmaneuvered the Republicans on the committees. That’s surprising, given the extensive experience of Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., as a former federal prosecutor. Gowdy should have known better than to take the bait.

The Republican members succeeded only in turning Strzok into a Democratic hero and giving him a national audience for his emphatic denials of Republican allegations that his anti-Trump and pro-Clinton political allegiance influenced his investigations involving the two candidates.

Not only did the Republican committee members fail to recognize Strzok’s public relations trap. They allowed Strzok’s former lover Lisa Page to delay her committee appearance – originally scheduled for Wednesday – until after she had ample opportunity to observe his televised testimony. All Page has to do now is tailor her answers to match Strzok’s.

This is a circus that only lacks a big tent.

Gowdy should have known that there was zero chance of a “Perry Mason” moment like those featured on the old TV show about a defense lawyer, when Strzok would break down under the withering questions of GOP members and confess to placing his thumb on the scale of the investigations.

Strzok is no dummy. He was not going incriminate himself at the hearing to set himself up to be charged with obstruction of justice for improperly influencing the investigations of the Trump campaign or the Clinton emails.

It also appears that Gowdy failed to anticipate the coordinated strategy of the Democratic members to obstruct the hearing and run interference for their new hero, who they painted as a patriot and noble martyr who sacrificed his FBI career for the good of the nation.

The simple and uncontroverted facts concerning Strzok’s actions and expressed intent can be found in the recent report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz that was thorough and detailed.

Horowitz ultimately came to the wrong overall conclusion, but did state that investigators had no confidence that Strzok did not improperly influence the Clinton email investigation by ignoring relevant evidence.

The Horowitz report described how Strzok, as the head of the Clinton email investigation, sat on his hands for well over three weeks after the New York FBI office reported to him that it had discovered new evidence relevant to the Clinton investigation.

This – when matched with Strzok’s contemporaneous statements – appears to amount to, at minimum, obstruction of justice. It would not be a stretch to convince a jury of 12 that Strzok’s expressed intent to improperly change the course of the investigation was accompanied by actions.

While Strzok’s testimony was uninformative, his arrogant and smug demeanor and feigned outrage during his testimony spoke loudly to anyone who observed it objectively. Does he really think we are so gullible that we would buy his absurd claim that his “we’ll stop it” text meant all of us – the American people – would act to stop Trump from becoming president?

Rather than getting a platform to speak to the nation in a daylong TV performance, Strzok should be summarily dismissed from the FBI, thoroughly investigated and prosecuted if the evidence shows he has broken the law.",politics

Capuano, who is white, was endorsed by key labor unions and the Congressional Black Caucus. Prominent African-American Democrats endorsing him included U.S. Rep. and civil right icon John Lewis of Georgia, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters of California, and former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick.

In addition, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh supported Capuano. The congressman’s supporters touted his experience and his clout on the Financial Services Committee.

But primary electorates in districts where whites are now in the minority – including Capuano’s – aren’t impressed with such arguments. Pressley attracted supporters with her message that the district needs an activist progressive who will take the lead on social change.

Capuano could feel the ground shifting under him. He was criticized for having called former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling protests against perceived racial injustice and police misconduct “not productive.”

Capuano’s warnings that the Democratic Party should avoid being “balkanized” by racial identity were ignored. His support for reforming the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency was ridiculed by Pressley, who called for abolishing ICE.

Pressley’s message was simple: “The people closest to the pain should be closest to the power.” She showcased her history as a survivor of sexual assault and her upbringing by a single mother in a household where her father was often in jail.

Pressley’s victory, coming on the heels of democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s stunning primary upset in a congressional district in New York City in June, has given the Democratic Party’s hard-left wing the belief that history is on its side.

But Tuesday’s primary brought some sobering news as well. Two far-left female challengers to other Massachusetts Democrats were defeated after taking less than 30 percent of the vote against congressional incumbents.

Centrist Rep. Richard Neal defeated Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, an African-American Muslim and civil rights lawyer. Rep. Stephen Lynch, a relatively conservative Democrat, won over Brianna Wu, a video game developer.

The common thread in both races where the hard-left candidates failed is that while they were all outspent, their constituencies were also primarily both middle-class and non-minority.

The far-left forces in the Democratic Party can take satisfaction from their primary victories this year. Last week, leftist Andrew Gillum was able to take advantage of a divided field of moderates and win the Democratic primary for governor in Florida with 34 percent of the vote.

Earlier, left-wing African-American candidates Stacey Abrams won the Democratic primary to run for governor of Georgia and Ben Jealous won the Democratic nomination for governor of Maryland.

But with rare exceptions, Democrats on the left wing of the party haven’t been able to break out of progressive bubbles and win victories with broader-based constituencies.

On the Republican side in the Massachusetts primary, Gov. Charlie Baker was nominated to run for a second term. He will face Democrat Jay Gonzalez in November.

GOP state legislator Geoff Diehl was nominated to run for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Elizabeth Warren, who is heavily favored to win re-election. Diehl, who chaired President Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts, defeated two other Republicans in the primary.",politics
"Dubbed a “Chernobyl on ice” and a “nuclear Titanic” by one environmental group, Russia’s first floating nuclear power plant is almost ready for its maiden voyage to a remote port town across the Bering Strait from Alaska – a move seen by many as both Moscow’s latest push to take control of the Arctic and one fraught with ecological peril.

Russian state nuclear company Rosatom, which developed and built the Akademik Lomonosov power plant, said that the unit docked last Saturday in the port city of Murmansk, along the Kola Bay in northwestern Russia. After taking on a supply of nuclear fuel, the floating power plant will be towed across the Northern Sea Route to Pevek on the East Siberian Sea, where officials say it is expected to replace a coal-fired power plant and an aging nuclear power plant sometime next year.

""Akademik Lomonosov is an unparalleled piece of engineering by Russian scientists,” Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachov said at a welcome ceremony in Murmansk. “It is a first-of-a-kind, reference project for mobile medium capacity range nuclear power units, a product we expect to be growing in demand in the coming years.”

Likhachov added that the floating nuclear plant, which is expected to supply electricity to more than 50,000 people in the isolated Far East region of Chukotka, could become a model for island nations “where it is difficult, for various reasons, to set up a developed centralized power transmission infrastructure.”

The floating nuclear plant has added another layer of worry for the U.S. military’s senior command, who recently signaled its concern for “a mounting Russian footprint” in the Arctic as Moscow works to revitalize its northern fleet and military bases.

“They’ve got all their chess pieces on the board right now, and we’ve got a pawn and maybe a rook,” Adm. Paul Zukunft, the commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, said in March. “If you look at this Arctic game of chess, they’ve got us at checkmate right at the very beginning.”

For their part, Russian officials have praised the floating nuclear plant both as a way to supply electricity to hard-to-reach areas in Russia, to provide power for oil and gas exploration and as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions responsible in part for global warming.

They’ve got all their chess pieces on the board right now, and we’ve got a pawn and maybe a rook...If you look at this Arctic game of chess, they’ve got us at checkmate right at the very beginning. - Admiral Paul Zukunft, the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard

Environmental groups like Greenpeace, however, have voiced concerns about the safety of the Russia power plant.

“Nuclear reactors bobbing around the Arctic Ocean will pose a shockingly obvious threat to a fragile environment which is already under enormous pressure from climate change,” Jan Haverkamp, a nuclear expert for Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe, said in a statement.

The green group, along with pressure from the Baltic states, has already successfully lobbied Russia to move the loading of the Akademik Lomonosov from the densely-populated St. Petersburg to Murmansk, but there are major concerns about the transport across the Northern Sea Route to Pevek and the docking of the nuclear plant off the coast of the port town.

“The floating nuclear power plants will typically be put to use near coastlines and shallow water,” Haverkamp said. “Contrary to claims regarding safety, the flat-bottomed hull and the floating nuclear power plant’s lack of self-propulsion makes it particularly vulnerable to tsunamis and cyclones.”

Despite the criticism and safety concerns, Russia is forging ahead with plans to produce more of the floating plants, which it says can operate non-stop without the need for refueling for between three and five years. At least 15 countries -- including China, Argentina Algeria, Indonesia, Malaysia and Argentina -- have shown an interest in hiring Rosatom to build them their own floating nuclear plants.

The Russian floating nuclear plant may seem like a new idea, but it is actually far from the first of its kind.

During the height of the Vietnam War, the U.S. Army turned a repurposed World War II Liberty ship into a floating 10 megawatt nuclear power plant and moored it in Gatun Lake in the Panama Canal. Named the Sturgis, the plant provided electricity to civil and military operations in the Panama Canal Zone until 1976, when it was decommissioned.

The decommissioning process is still taking place at the Port of Galveston in Texas, but so far more than 99 percent of the vessel's radioactive parts have been transported to waste facilities.

“When the Liberty Ship was converted into a floating nuclear reactor back in the 1960’s, they never intended for it to be taken apart,” Baltimore District Project Manager Brenda Barber of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said in a 2017 press release. “It was built to house a nuclear reactor with thick elements of steel, lead and concrete barriers which provided protection for the workers and the public during her operations.”",world

Colombians are voting Sunday in a first-of-a-kind referendum that aims to curb corruption in a country where white-collar criminals are fast replacing drug gangs and paramilitary groups in penetrating the upper echelons of power.

The referendum seeks to slash the salaries of Colombia's Congress members and to bring laws that make public spending more efficient and transparent.

But while most Colombians agree that corruption is a plague that needs to be exterminated, some believe putting it to a vote is not the best way to do so.

The referendum has been boycotted by Colombia's judges over fears it will lead to wage cuts in the judicial branch since a law states that salaries for top magistrates should be the same as those of Congress members.

""We already have lots of anti-corruption laws,"" said Hermens Lara, a Bogota municipal judge who is director of the Board of Judges and Magistrates of Colombia. ""The problem is implementing them.""

Newly elected President Ivan Duque and most of Colombia's main political parties say they back the measure, but they have done little to promote it or to lure voters to the polls.

Voters on Sunday will be asked seven questions that include whether to hand down tougher penalties on corrupt officials who now often serve out sentences in multi-million dollar homes; whether term limits should be imposed on lawmakers, and whether the salaries of members of Congress should be reduced by 40 percent.

Colombian law currently sets senators' salaries at about $124,000 per year, more than what parliamentarians make in countries like Holland, Sweden and France.

The measures focus on Congress and some experts question whether the changes would do anything to curb corruption elsewhere, such as within the judiciary or police.

""Some of the proposals have no impact on corruption,"" says Marcela Anzola, a consultant for the Inter-American Development Bank. Still she said that passage would ""give greater legitimacy to anti-corruption initiatives and send a strong message to politicians.""

According to Colombia's inspector general, corruption in the country is equivalent to 4 percent of gross domestic product each year. One recent study by Transparency International found that 63 percent of companies in Colombia feared losing business if they did not engage in bribery.

That face of corruption in Colombia marks a stark change from the days when cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar was elected to Congress and his rivals in the Cali Cartel helped elect a president. Just a little over a decade ago, scores of congressional members were also charged or investigated for ties to right-wing paramilitary groups.

But today, experts say the biggest threat comes from white-collar criminals.

One example is the expansion of an oil refinery in Cartagena, which ended up costing more than double its projected $3.3 billion price tag due to what authorities described as mismanagement and graft by officials who were in cahoots with contractors.

The referendum would give Colombia's Congress a year to pass legislation implementing the proposals or force Duque to do so by decree.

Getting the minimum number of votes to make the results binding, however, is a tall order.

The measures need approval from 12 million voters — or roughly a third of the 36 million registered voters. Turnout in the country's recent presidential election barely reached 50 percent, while a 2016 referendum on a peace deal with leftist rebels to end a half century of fighting barely drew 13 million votes.

Campaigning for the referendum has been spearheaded by Claudia Lopez, a former senator and vice presidential candidate for the center-left Green Party.

Lopez said she began to push for the referendum after Congress repeatedly rejected anti-corruption bills that her party had proposed.

""Corrupt politicians will never vote to place limits on themselves,"" Lopez told The Associated Press. ""That's why this referendum is the best tool we have to tackle corruption.""

Lopez and her supporters have tried to overcome voter apathy with the help of a famous satirist, recording a campaign video that shows Lopez and a handful of middle-aged congressmen dressed up as reggaeton singers who riff that corruption is the ""cancer of Colombia"" and must be stopped.

Julian Ramirez, an 18-year-old political science student in Bogota, said he has been campaigning for the anti-corruption referendum since last year, when activists collected 4 million signatures to get officials to fund the vote.

""Fighting corruption should be something we can all unite under,"" Ramirez said as he walked around a central Bogota neighborhood handing out flyers.",world
"John McCain’s death from brain cancer at age 81 came exactly nine years after the death of Ted Kennedy – and both longtime U.S. senators died from the same type of brain cancer.

McCain, R-Ariz., had been battling the illness for just over a year while Kennedy, D-Mass., died at age 77, 13 months after his diagnosis, the Arizona Republic reported.

Both succumbed to glioblastoma, which affects roughly 10,000 Americans a year and is described by doctors as ""highly malignant.""

Despite being from opposite ends of the political spectrum, the two senators were reportedly close friends. During Kennedy’s funeral service in 2009, McCain read a eulogy in which he said, “The place won’t be the same without him.”

“I admired his passion for his convictions, his patience with the hard and sometimes dull work of legislating, and his uncanny sense for when differences could be bridged,"" McCain told the Boston crowd.

McCain, much like Kennedy when he battled his illness, was largely absent from Washington during the final year of his life. But the Arizona ""maverick"" angered many of his Republican colleagues last September when he voted in opposition to a GOP-led effort to overhaul ObamaCare.

"Melissa Howard, the GOP candidate for a Florida state House seat who was accused of lying about her college degree and NRA rating apologized on Monday, pledging to stay in the race “and lead by example from now on.”

After questions arose about Howard’s academic credentials, the state House candidate posted a photo of what she said was a copy of her transcripts to Facebook. She also sent photos of what she said was her diploma to media outlets, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported.

But Robin Parker, general counsel for Miami University, told the Herald-Tribune that Howard never graduated from the college and questioned the diploma’s authenticity.

On Monday Howard admitted on her Facebook page that she didn't graduate from the school.

""I made a mistake in saying that I completed my degree. What I did was wrong and set a bad example for someone seeking public service. I am staying in the race and intend to win and lead by example from now on,"" she said.

Even if she dropped out, it's too late to get her name off the ballot ahead of the Aug. 28 primary. Vote-by-mail ballots were sent out a month ago. The seat represents portions of Manatee and Sarasota counties, where about 20,000 Republican votes already have been cast.

The Herald-Tribune also reported that Howard posted about an A rating from the National Rifle Association on Facebook; however, Marion Hammer, a former NRA president who now leads the group's lobbying efforts in Florida, said Howard actually received a B grade.

Howard did not specifically reference the NRA rating controversy in her Monday apology.

Her primary opponent, Tommy Gregory, didn't immediately comment.

"After sitting through almost seven hours of opening statements from senators and repeated outbursts from protesters at his confirmation hearing Tuesday, Judge Brett Kavanaugh showed why he would be an outstanding Supreme Court Justice when he delivered a brief opening statement.

Democrats desperate to keep this extraordinarily qualified judge off the nation’s highest court never let up in their daylong demonization of the judge, who currently serves on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

But Kavanaugh was calm throughout the hearing conducted by the Senate Judiciary Committee and finally responded by emphasizing a judge’s duty to correctly interpret the law, rather than bending it to achieve his or any other judge’s view of the best policy.

“A good judge must be an umpire – a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy,” Kavanaugh said in his opening statement. “I don’t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge.”

Kavanaugh directly responded to those who demand only that he decide their way on their favorite policy issues of the day.

“Over the past 12 years, I have ruled sometimes for the prosecution and sometimes for criminal defendants, sometimes for workers and sometimes for businesses, sometimes for environmentalists and sometimes for coal miners,” the Supreme Court nominee said. “In each case, I have followed the law.”

Democrats are going to get nowhere trying to attack Kavanaugh on his possible future rulings on health care or abortion. Indeed, Kavanaugh has written nothing significant about these or other hot social issues – which is why some religious conservatives launched a whisper campaign against him immediately after Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement.

Like nominees of all stripes since the Senate rejected Robert Bork’s nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987, Kavanaugh will refuse to answer questions on any specific matters that might come before as a justice. That’s appropriate – Supreme Court justices should judge cases based on the evidence and legal arguments that are presented to them, not based on their preconceived personal views.

It’s too bad that Democratic senators who entered the confirmation hearing with closed minds – determined to oppose Kavanaugh regardless of what he says or what his record shows – don’t show the patience, moderation, and good spirits that Kavanaugh displayed Tuesday.

The judge called for a return to the civility and common sense that used to characterize America’s greatest institutions of government. That’s something both Democrats and Republicans should agree to.

“The Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution,” Kavanaugh said. “The justices on the Supreme Court do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle. They do not caucus in separate rooms. If confirmed to the court, I would be part of a team of nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States.”

That kind of reasonableness could make Kavanaugh a far more influential player on the Supreme Court than Democrats may think. While the late Justice Antonin Scalia and the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist could excite with cutting prose or daring ideas, they had difficulty building winning coalitions on the high court for conservative jurisprudence.

Kavanaugh made clear that he would instead follow the example of Justice Kennedy, who he was nominated to replace for whom he clerked.

Kavanaugh described Kennedy as his mentor and hero, and called him “a model of civility and collegiality.” If Kavanaugh were to apply his reasonableness and persuasive talents on the Supreme Court, he might move the court toward the more restrained, limited role that conservatives have hoped for these last three decades.

In both legitimate and illegitimate ways, liberals attempted to block the start of the first day of Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing. Police had to remove protesters from the hearing room and several dozen were arrested.

Democratic senators repeatedly interrupted the Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, when he delivered his mild opening statement, The Democrats unreasonably demanded a delay over the late release of thousands of pages of documents by the White House. This was an obvious stalling tactic without justification.

Such delaying tactics, however, reveal a Democratic Senate minority that has little stomach for conducting a responsible debate over the future of the Supreme Court.

In fact, if the issue at hand was simply Kavanaugh’s qualifications to sit on the high court he should win the approval of every senator, regardless of party.

Kavanaugh boasts a sterling background, including service as a law clerk in a federal appeals court and the Supreme Court, an aide to Kenneth W. Starr’s Whitewater probe and a prominent White House official under President George W. Bush. He has served for 12 years on the federal appeals court in the nation’s capital – commonly known as the second most important in the nation.

Democrats fighting Kavanaugh’s nomination are doing so because he was nominated by a Republican president they bitterly oppose. But since they are the minority party in the Senate, Kavanaugh seems virtually certain to win confirmation.

The judge might even pick up a few votes from vulnerable Senate Democrats – such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota – who face difficult re-election campaigns in states carried by Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

More important than his resume is Kavanaugh’s understanding of the limited judicial role in society.

In his opening statement, Kavanaugh rejected the outcome-oriented approach to judging that seems popular among Democratic senators, emphasizing his nonpartisanship and fairness in judging cases.

But that’s not what Senate Democrats want to hear. The vast majority of them appear to want to see justices on the Supreme Court who support the Democratic political platform of abortion rights, socialized medical care, and other issues near and dear to the party’s left wing.

This is not the role of a Supreme Court justice, and Brett Kavanaugh knows this. If he joins the nation’s highest court we can be sure he will be an outstanding and fair justice.",politics

Slovenian police on Thursday arrested two people for paramilitary activity after video footage and photos surfaced on social media of a group of armed, masked men led by a right-wing former presidential candidate.

Police said that around 40 criminal investigators were searching five houses in the northeastern area around the town of Maribor in the Stajerska region where the group was filmed.

The video showing several dozen masked men training in a field in military-like outfits and holding axes and rifles has drawn widespread condemnation in the small European Union nation.

Nationalist politician Andrej Sisko has said the armed men weren't paramilitary militia, but ""free men"" and guards of the Stajerska region. Sisko is known for his anti-immigrant stance.

Local media say Sisko was arrested in Thursday's raid, but police haven't confirmed this. Photos from the scene showed police escorting a smiling Sisko, wearing a red baseball cap but no handcuffs.

The suspects face charges of ""inciting violent change of constitutional order"" and illicit arms and drug trafficking.

Sisko won around 2 percent of the votes at last year's presidential election. His United Slovenia Movement didn't make it into parliament in June balloting.

Police said in their statement that some of the participants of the Sept. 1 gathering were ""misled by the organizers."" They urged all who took part to come forward.

Sisko also attended an anti-immigrant rally of about 200 people in southeastern Slovenia who protested against plans to open a migrant center in their area bordering Croatia from where migrants cross into Slovenia.

Traditionally moderate Slovenia has seen a rise in right-wing sentiments recently amid a wider populist surge in central and eastern Europe. An anti-immigrant party won the most votes in the June 3 election, but it has been sidelined by left-leaning groups that are expected to form the next government.",world
"Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on Sunday put pressure on two female Republican senators to vote against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying the nominee views the president as an “oligarch” who cannot be charged or investigated for crimes.

“The president believes he is above the law. And this nominee believes this president cannot be investigated, cannot be tried,” Feinstein said at the Year of the Woman luncheon at a Santa Barbara hotel held by the Democratic Women of Santa Barbara County, the Los Angeles Times reported.

""The president believes he is above the law. And this nominee believes this president cannot be investigated, cannot be tried."" - Sen. Dianne Feinstein

The senator stressed that the confirmation of Kavanaugh depends on two Republican votes – Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – both of whom are women, Feinstein emphasized.

She also criticized “hyper-partisanship” and the president’s “erraticism” and “lying.” She described the Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the alleged Russian collusion with the Trump campaign as the most significant government probe of her time in politics, the newspaper reported.

The event was among the latest campaign events she attended to ensure stress-free victory this upcoming November. While previous polls indicated Feinstein’s strong lead against her opponent, state Sen. Kevin de Leon, the latest poll suggests the race may be a lot tighter than previously expected.

Feinstein’s remarks at the event came after Kavanaugh was grilled for four days on issues such as abortion and gun rights. The senator was criticized by her election opponent for deciding to follow the procedures to question Kavanaugh during the hearings rather than join the rowdy protesters who frequently interrupted.

“We should be praising the protesters and standing outside with them, not apologizing for their actions. We need a senator from California who will stand up and #RESIST not #ASSIST,” tweeted de Leon after Feinstein apologized to the high court nominee for interruptions.

By contrast, California Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., earned near-universal praise from progressives for taking an aggressive approach when questioning Kavanaugh.

Despite the criticism, Feinstein was embraced by the event’s attendees, giving her a round of applause for her job questioning Kavanaugh.

The senator’s comments are sure to put pressure on Collins and Murkowski, who are often considered as swing votes in the senate as they at times broke from the rest of the Republican senators, and vote against the confirmation of Kavanaugh.",politics

A massive fire tore through a 200-year-old museum in Rio de Janeiro late Sunday, lighting up the night and sending large plumes of smoke into the air.

Firefighters worked to put out the blaze at the esteemed National Museum in northern Rio, which houses artefacts from Egypt, Greco-Roman art and some of the first fossils found in Brazil.

In a statement, the museum said the blaze began around 7:30 p.m. There were no reported injuries and the fire began after it had closed to the public, said the statement. It wasn't immediately clear how the fire began.

In a statement, President Michel Temer said it was ""a sad day for all Brazilians.""

""Two hundred years of work, investigation and knowledge have been lost,"" said Temer.

According to the museum's website, it has more than 20,000 items related to the history of Brazil and other countries, and that many of its collections came from members of Brazil's royal family.

Connected to the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, the museum has expositions that include anthropology, archaeology and paleontology, among others.

"President Trump's meeting with House Republicans to discuss immigration legislation briefly went awry Tuesday after the president mocked Rep. Mark Sanford over a primary election loss.

Two sources in the meeting room told The Associated Press that Trump joked: ""I want to congratulate Mark on a great race.""

A senior House Republican who is a Trump supporter told Fox News that the president's comment was ""unnecessary"" and ""poor form."" Another senior GOP lawmaker called it a ""low blow.""

Another GOP member told Fox News the room got ""pretty quiet"" after the remark and some attendees booed in a low tone of voice.

Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and frequent Trump critic, was defeated by state Rep. Katie Arrington in the June 12 primary. Hours before the polls closed, Trump endorsed Arrington on Twitter and joked that Sanford was ""better off in Argentina"" -- a reference to a sex scandal that overshadowed Sanford's tenure as governor.

Sanford blamed his defeat on Trump, saying support for the president is becoming a litmus test in GOP primaries.

""It's a very tribal environment right now,"" he said at the time.

"A couple accused of training children to carry out mass shootings at an ""extremist Muslim"" compound in the New Mexico desert singled out an Atlanta hospital as one target before police arrested them, according to court documents filed Friday.

Prosecutors in Taos County, citing interviews with the 11 children found at the compound earlier this month, claimed in the filing that Jany Leveille wanted to ""confront 'corrupt' institutions or individuals ... and reveal the 'truth' to these corrupt institutions or individuals.""

According to the prosecutors, one of the children said Leveille ""specifically"" mentioned Grady Hospital as a ""corrupt"" institution. They added that Leveille ""expressed her displeasure with Grady Hospital ... due to treatment she and her mother received there.""

The filing also said investigators recovered a 10-page, handwritten document entitled ""Phases of a Terrorist Attack"" from the New Mexico compound. The document includes ""instructions for the one-time terrorist,"" but it was not clear if a specific target was mentioned.

Authorities also said Leveille and her partner, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, ""would laugh and joke about dying in Jihad.""

Prosecutors also outlined allegations that Wahhaj and his 3-year-old son, Abdul-ghani Wahhaj, left Georgia without taking medications the boy needed to treat severe health problems, including seizures that stemmed from a lack of oxygen and blood flow at birth.

The affidavit alleged that Leveille and Wahhaj witnessed the boy's seizures and knew he had a diagnosed seizure disorder but apparently gave him no medication and took no action to seek proper medical care.

Prosecutors quoted an extensive account of the child's death as written in a journal entry they attributed to Leveille, indicating that Abdul-ghani died in late December 2017 as the exhausted boy's heartbeat faded in and out during a religious ritual accompanied by a reading of the Koran and aimed at casting out demonic spirits.

The boy's remains were found Aug. 6 inside an underground tunnel at the compound.

The prosecutors filed the document as part of their appeal of a district judge's order that could allow at least three of the five adult defendants in the case to be released on house arrest with ankle monitors.

Judge Sarah Backus said the previous evidence provided by prosecutors was troubling but did not indicate any clear threat to public safety from the defendants, who have no criminal records. On Friday, prosecutors said that their new evidence proved Leveille ""and possibly others of the defendants may suffer from dangerous delusions ... [and] ... have history of endangering the welfare of children.""

In addition to charges of child neglect against her, Leveille also is being held on accusations by federal immigration authorities that she overstayed her non-immigrant visitor visa after arriving 20 years ago in the United States from her native Haiti. She was returned Thursday to Taos from a federal holding facility in Texas.

"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made clear Wednesday that, unlike President Trump, she doesn't dig coal.

“We're not gonna have a coal power plant floating around,” Pelosi said during a discussion about energy policy at the Public Policy Institute of California in San Francisco.

Her appearance coincided with the Trump administration’s rollback and replacement of Obama-era regulations on emissions from coal-fired power plants.

The newly unveiled Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, as it’s called, would give authority to the states to set their own rules how to restrict carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.

“And it really is a moral issue if you believe as I do that this is God’s creation [and] we have to be good stewards of it,” Pelosi said.

“We have evangelicals and others with us — er, some, those who believe in God’s creation. So, in any case this was a big thing for us. I had to fight some Democrats. Senator Byrd had a coal powered plan fueling the Capitol, you know I [unintelligible] that’s gonna go, with all due respect to West Virginia we’re not gonna have a coal power plant floating around.”

But as Pelosi mocked West Virginia, many in the state celebrated the administration’s efforts to revitalize the industry.

“[Trump’s] almost single-handedly turned this industry around,” Chris Hamilton, senior vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association, said on ""Fox & Friends"" on Wednesday, noting the “the darkest days” for the industry are now over.

“We experienced perhaps the darkest days within the coal industry during the — President Obama’s eight years and as a result, we just saw nothing but the, you know, the type of consequences you find when you have a president utilizing every resource available to him to ratchet down and … do away with the coal industry, “ he added.

Bo Copley, a West Virginia coal worker who made headlines in 2016 when he confronted then-candidate Hillary Clinton with his family photo and asked about her plans to cut coal mining jobs, also praised Trump’s plans to ease the regulations and follow through his campaign promise to protect the industry and the jobs.

“It's great for us to be able to say we have someone who cares about the people in this state and cares about the people in our industry, that he's got our back,” he told Fox News on Monday, adding that the administration’s support for the industry is one of the reasons the state will continue to back him.",politics
"U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who survived a corruption trial last year, is forcing his party to spend big on him as he struggles to fend off a Republican challenger.

Bob Hugin, a former U.S. Marine and pharmaceutical executive, has cut Menendez's lead to a mere 6 points, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released last week. Back in March, when the race began, Hugin trailed by 17 points and it appeared as if Menendez was on his way to an easy victory.

Hugin attacked Menendez over the weekend, saying that if he hadn't decided to run, Menendez would likely have been re-elected without facing any real opposition.

“My wife and I were just offended that Bob Menendez was going to be reelected without any real opposition. He’s had 35 years of being involved in corruption,” Hugin said during an interview with New York's WNYM-AM radio, according to the Hill.

Democrats have taken notice of Menendez’s struggling campaign, pouring in $117,000 for ads in recent weeks.

Adding to Menendez's misery, James Fozman, a Democratic city councilman in the Jersey Shore township of Brick, has snubbed Menendez and instead endorsed Hugin.

“I’m endorsing [Hugin] to restore the honesty and integrity to the office,” Fozman told Brick Shorebeat. “We strongly believe in protecting our environment on issues like solar and wind, and opposing offshore drilling.”

Fozman told the outlet that he considered leaving the party over its continued support for Menendez, who wasn’t able to get the support of nearly 4 in 10 of the state's Democrats.

Those state Democrats went on to support an unknown challenger in the primary who spent no money against Menendez.

But while Fozman's opposition to Menendez may not decide the election, it raises larger questions about whether the senator, who eluded a corruption conviction thanks to a hung jury in November, is capable of retaining his seat.

Meanwhile, the spending spree by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) on behalf of Menendez was mocked by Chris Hansen, the National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director.

“The DSCC is starting to spend in conjunction with @BobMenendezNJ in a race he is very much in danger of losing. This will no doubt trigger a dozen more Beto think pieces,” Hansen tweeted.

Hansen was referring to Democrats’ hopes to turn Texas blue and replace Sen. Ted Cruz with Rep. Beto O’Rourke, the rising star of the moderate Democratic Party who’s been receiving especially favorable media coverage, all while their candidates are struggling in already solid-blue states.

“With the DSCC and outside groups having to spend big in expensive states like New Jersey and Florida, it’s no surprise red state Dems are acting like it’s the Hunger Games for Chuck’s money,” NRSC communications director Katie Martin told the Washington Free Beacon.

“Every dime and second spent trying to defend a corrupt politician like Bob Menendez in New Jersey means resources aren’t going to states President Trump carried by double digits,” she added.",politics

Brazil's main leftist party said Saturday it's sticking with former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as its presidential candidate even though the electoral court has thrown him off the ballot for an election just five weeks away.

Da Silva's vice presidential running mate, former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad told reporters the Workers Party will continue pushing to somehow get da Silva, 72, who easily leads in the polls, back on the ballot.

""The people are sovereign regarding the party's candidate. And that candidate is Lula,"" Haddad said.

That strategy would keep da Silva in the spotlight until the absolute last minute, perhaps rallying support from backers that could then be transferred to a stand-in, likely Haddad, who is much less popular or charismatic.

The electoral court voted 6-1 early Saturday to reject da Silva's candidacy because of a corruption conviction that has been upheld on appeal. Da Silva and the party are appealing both the conviction and the electoral court ruling.

The ruling had been widely expected and there were no immediate street protests of the sort that occurred when the former president was initially arrested.

Da Silva, who was wildly popular when he left office on Jan. 1, 2011, is now a sharply polarizing figure. Many Brazilians still revere him for pulling millions from poverty during his eight years in power.

But he and the Workers' Party have lost much of that appeal over the last several years due to a stumbling economy under his hand-picked successor Dilma Rousseff and a sprawling corruption probe that has ensnared many top businessmen and politicians, including da Silva.

That division was clear in the reaction to the electoral court ruling.

""We have a big debt with Lula,"" said Thiago Renato, a 39-year-old IT specialist in the northeastern city of Recife.

""We trust him here. I will vote for whoever he endorses because then I will know who will have the biggest impact for the poor,"" he added. ""I know Haddad, but I don't know him well. If he is the candidate, he will have my vote.""

At a Sao Paulo coffee shop, Alexandre Fonseca- 21 year old medical student, called the court decision an ""unfortunate and fully expected ruling,"" one unlikely to be overturned on appeal.

""The party must unite behind Haddad or whoever will replace Lula, to win the elections and give continuity to his legacy,"" he said.

But Virginia Toledo, a 37-year-old housewife in Sao Paulo, said da Silva's ouster means ""we have another reason to celebrate.""

""First he was jailed and now his chances of returning to power have been eliminated,"" she said, while buying ice cream for her 10-year-old daughter

""We have to pray that Haddad or whoever the Workers' Party chooses as its candidate for president does not win the election,"" she added

The former president is serving a 12-year-sentence for corruption and money laundering after being convicted of trading favors with construction company Grupo OAS in exchange for the promise of a beach house apartment.

As part of the ruling, Justice Luis Roberto Barroso said the Workers' Party should replace da Silva within 10 days, and that he should not appear as a presidential candidate in free airtime that is given to political parties on nationwide TV and radio.

However the party used the first day of free campaign TV airtime on Saturday to denounce the electoral court ruling in a spot that featured filed footage of da Silva.

Left-leaning candidate Ciro Gomes of the Democratic Labor Party said the electoral court's ruling was ""not a good thing for Brazil.""

""No matter how much Lula is detested in some sectors and no matter how he is idolized in others, to prohibit the country's biggest popular leader from taking part in the electoral process is traumatic.""",world

EXCLUSIVE: President Trump joins 'Fox & Friends' for a wide-ranging interview on Thursday at 6 a.m. ET

The FBI and Justice Department will brief the bipartisan 'Gang of 8' lawmakers on the Russia investigation Thursday after meeting with two key House Republicans, Reps. Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy

North Korea threatened to back out of a scheduled summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un, and reportedly called Vice President Mike Pence a 'political dummy'

The NFL's decision to require players to stand during the national anthem has sparked strong reaction from supporters and critics - and marks a victory for President Trump

The Trump administration has launched an investigation into whether tariffs are needed on imported autos and auto parts

THE LEAD STORY: TRUMP'S EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW ON 'FOX & FRIENDS': President Donald Trump will join ""Fox & Friends"" on Thursday for a wide-ranging interview with host Brian Kilmeade ... Trump is expected to discuss a number of issues: his plans to confront the violent El Salvador-based gang MS-13; the new NFL ruling penalizing teams for kneeling during the national anthem; the latest developments in the president's planned summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and more. Tune in to ""Fox & Friends"" this Thursday, starting at 6 a.m. ET!

PREVIEW: Trump gives Kilmeade his thoughts on the N. Korea summit

THE 'GANG' IS ALL HERE: FBI and Justice Department officials on Thursday will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers known as the ""Gang of 8"" on classified documents related to the special counsel's Russia investigation after they meet with two key House Republican lawmakers, Fox News has learned ... The first meeting at Justice Department headquarters is scheduled to take place at noon ET and will include White House Chief of Staff John Kelly; Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein; FBI Director Christopher Wray; Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats; House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif.; and House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. The second meeting, scheduled for 2 p.m., will include Kelly, Rosenstein, Wray, Coats, Gowdy, Republican and Democratic leaders from both the House and Senate, and the top lawmakers from their intelligence panels.

Both House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told Fox News they plan to attend the second meeting. Warner is vice chairman of the Senate intelligence panel. The announcement of a second meeting came after criticism from Democrats who said the briefing should have been given to the ""Gang of 8"" as opposed to just Nunes and Gowdy.

DIMMING SUMMIT HOPES? - North Korea early Thursday threatened to back away from the much-anticipated upcoming summit with the U.S. and called Vice President Mike Pence a ""political dummy,"" ratcheting up the rhetoric after months of signaling an openness to compromise ... The dig at Pence apparently stemmed from his Fox News interview on Monday, when he told Martha MacCallum on ""The Story,"" that North Korea ""asked for the meeting"" with the U.S. ""As a person involved in the U.S. affairs, I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the U.S. vice president,"" North Korea's vice foreign minister, Choe Sun Hui, said in a statement released by state media, according to the Wall Street Journal. Choe said the U.S. ""has asked for the dialogue"" with the North but is now ""misleading the public opinion as if we have invited them to sit with us.""

NFL'S #WINNING NEW NATIONAL ANTHEM POLICY: A decision from NFL owners requiring players to stand for ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" if they are on the field when the anthem is played has triggered intense reaction from supporters and opponents, as one owner revealed that he abstained from the vote ... Commissioner Roger Goodell said the change was approved unanimously at the league's spring meeting in Atlanta. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told Fox News in an email that San Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York was the only abstention. The NFL's anthem policy change is a victory for President Trump, who repeatedly blasted players who refused to stand for the anthem and publicly reminded league executives about the league's withering ratings. Vice President Mike Pence, who left a game between the 49ers and Indianapolis Colts this past October after some 49ers knelt during the anthem, tweeted a link to a news story about the policy change with the phrase, ""#Winning.""

TRUMP CONSIDERS TARIFFS ON CARS: President Trump has a new trade target: cars. The Trump administration confirmed Wednesday that it may slap tariffs on imported vehicles and automotive parts, pending the outcome of an investigation by the Department of Commerce ... In a statement, Trump said he instructed Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to “consider initiating a Section 232 investigation into imports of automobiles, including trucks, and automotive parts to determine their effects on America’s national security.” Trump’s auto tariffs, if implemented, would be similar to how the administration imposed duties on imported steel and aluminum.

"President Trump is speaking forcefully about fixing a growing problem affecting our national discourse. He says we may need to regulate the giant tech companies that control vast swaths of our information landscape, due to their bias.

The president tweeted this week: “Google search results for ‘Trump News’ shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal?”

Google, Facebook and Twitter all claim they do not purposely discriminate due to political viewpoints. But it is increasingly clear that this is the outcome – whatever their intentions. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admitted his firm suffers from left-leaning bias and must do more work to ensure it doesn’t affect Twitter.

The question then becomes, what can President Trump do to affect this?

The first thing is exactly what the president has been doing – using the bully pulpit to influence the social media companies to change their behavior.

Government intervention should occur only as a last resort, because this would infringe on free speech and expression.

The social media firms need to take it upon themselves to solve the problems they have created, in many cases due to their own success.

Google, Facebook and Twitter dominate the online world in the same way that ABC, CBS and NBC dominated the world of television prior to cable TV. There are really no alternatives to these social media companies. That gives them great power, but also great responsibility. Thus far they have done better wielding the first than honoring the second.

Hopefully, the social media companies will heed the president’s warning, but if not, what can he do?

In this election season, the president could direct the Federal Election Commission to investigate the practices of the social media companies. The commission could examine whether suppressing conservative ideas – including in some cases the accounts of Republican candidates – constitutes an in-kind contribution to the Democratic Party and its candidates.

Security Studies Group submitted a complaint to the Federal Election Commission asking for this type of investigation into Twitter with a reference to the Fact Sheet on Viewpoint Discrimination we compiled.

Another avenue is to have the Federal Communications Commission look at the immunity granted to the social media companies as Internet service providers under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

This immunity for the companies exempts them from defamation lawsuits, because they are considered to be distributors of content rather than publishers that exert editorial control. It is reasonable to consider whether the amount of control these companies exert in deciding what content is available – or not available – changes this status.

Google, Facebook and Twitter are private companies. They have the right to have policies to promote liberal ideas and ban conservative ones from their platforms. But as publicly traded companies, they have a responsibility to speak honestly about their business practices. They can’t have their CEOs saying they do not discriminate if it can be shown they do.

President Trump could ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to examine whether the three companies are misleading their shareholders and the public.

There is also a question of whether the success of the social media companies has made them indispensable for businesses, organizations and many individuals. If so, there is the possibility that they could be declared to be public utilities and regulated that way to prevent discrimination.

This regulation has been imposed previously on electric power and telephone companies. If there is no alternative to their service and they are denying service to some businesses, organizations and individuals that is a legitimate government concern.

The goal here should not be to find ways for government to insert itself into the digital town square as some kind of referee. But right now, the public discourse is being limited and the social media companies are refusing to fairly serve some of their customers.

This refusal is dangerous, hindering the ability of people to be informed and act on the information they receive. Let’s hope the Silicon Valley crew decides to take action to make this right.",politics
"Special Counsel Robert Mueller has officially led the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with President Trump’s campaign for one year.

Read on for a refresher on all the many twists and turns to date, from those who have been charged to controversies surrounding the probe.

Appointment

Mueller was selected by the Justice Department to oversee the investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and any collusion with the Trump campaign on May 17, 2017.

The appointment came after a growing outcry -- specifically from Democrats -- for someone outside the Justice Department to handle the probe. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, one of Trump’s early backers, had already recused himself from the investigation.

Mueller led the FBI during the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the aftermath, having been appointed just months before by former President George W. Bush. Prior to that, he served as assistant U.S. attorney general and U.S. attorney, having been appointed to the latter job by former President Ronald Reagan.

Indictments

Multiple former campaign officials have been charged in Mueller’s probe, as well as several Russian officials and entities. However, none of the Trump associates face charges directly related to collusion with Russia.

Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, was indicted in October 2017 on charges that include conspiracy and making false statements. Additional charges, including tax evasion and bank fraud, were brought against him in February. He has pleaded not guilty.

Manafort sought to have his case dismissed as he accused Mueller’s team of exceeding its authority because the case against him was unrelated to Russian election interference. However, a federal judge ruled in May that Mueller does have the authority to prosecute.

Richard Gates, Manafort’s business associate and former deputy campaign manager, was hit with the same charges. However, he pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy and false statement charges in February. Like Manafort, Gates helped wrangle delegates at the 2016 Republican convention in Cleveland. He later helped start the nonprofit America First Policies, which was created to advance the White House’s agenda.

WHO’S BEEN CHARGED IN THE RUSSIA PROBE SO FAR?

Michael Flynn, the administration’s short-lived national security adviser, pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about certain conversations he had with a former Russian ambassador and giving false statements about two Trump transition team members involved in his outreach.

In February and May, Mueller’s team asked for a delay in the sentencing of Flynn, citing the “status” of the investigation.

George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser for Trump’s presidential campaign, pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to investigators. According to court filings, Papadopoulos was not truthful about his relationship with an “overseas professor” who had “substantial connections to Russian government officials.” That professor, according to prosecutors, told Papadopoulos he had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic campaign rival.

Papadopoulos also told an Australian diplomat in Britain that Russia had dirt on Clinton after a night of drinking. That meeting, and what investigators learned about it, helped provide the foundation for the Russia investigation, according to The New York Times.

Additionally, Richard Pinedo, a California man who sold bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election, pleaded guilty in February to using stolen identities to set up the accounts. The U.S. government said Pinedo was not aware he dealing with Russians when he sold the accounts, however.

Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch attorney, is the first person to be sentenced in the probe. He admitted to lying to investigators about his communications with Gates and another person, according to court documents. In April, van der Zwaan was sentenced to 30 days in prison and issued a $20,000 fine. Van der Zwaan is the son-in-law of Russian oligarch German Khan.

Separate from the Trump campaign officials, meanwhile, a grand jury in February indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for allegedly interfering in the 2016 presidential election, as part of the probe. One company has since pleaded not guilty.

Controversies

While Mueller has kept a tight lid on his investigation, there have been several controversies surrounding his team.

A judge’s accusations

In May, a federal judge accused Mueller’s team of aiming for “unfettered power” in order to take down Trump and suggested the team had lied in the investigation.

“You don’t really care about Mr. Manafort,” U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III said during a hearing for the former campaign chairman. “You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment or whatever.”

Flynn’s falsehoods?

When it comes to Flynn, a new report showed former FBI Director James Comey told Congress he did not believe Flynn intentionally lied about his talks with the Russian ambassador. He said agents who interviewed Flynn “discerned no physical indications of deception.”

“They saw nothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them,” Comey told members of the House Intelligence Committee, according to a committee report.

Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe has made similar statements. Still, Flynn lost his job at the White House and later pleaded guilty to lying to investigators.

These circumstances have raised questions about the plea. Supporters of Flynn, including his siblings, have encouraged him to withdraw his guilty plea after the judge in his case ordered Mueller’s team to hand over to Flynn’s lawyers “any evidence in its possession that is favorable” to Flynn. However, Robert Stahl, a white-collar criminal defense attorney in New York and New Jersey, told Fox News withdrawing a guilty plea “is extremely rare and very difficult.”

The start of it all

How the investigation got started has also been scrutinized. The sensitive memos Comey leaked to the media that detailed his conversations with Trump indeed served as the catalyst for Mueller to be appointed as special counsel, sources told Fox News.

5 REVELATIONS FROM JAMES COMEY’S MEMOIR

Comey, too, said during a June 2017 Senate testimony that he gave the memos to a friend who would leak them because he “thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” That friend, Columbia law professor Daniel Richman, had worked for Comey’s FBI as an unpaid “special government employee.” Comey has since been interviewed by the DOJ inspector general about his handling of the memos.

Mueller's team

Mueller’s team faced allegations of bias after it was revealed that the majority of its members are registered Democrats or have made political donations to liberal candidates and groups. In fact, at least 13 people on the 17-member team are registered as Democrats. At least nine, including some of the registered Democrats, have donated to Democratic candidates and causes, such as Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and former President Barack Obama.

In March, Trump accused the team of having “13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters and Zero Republicans.”

“Does anyone think this is fair?” Trump asked.

However, Mueller himself was a registered Republican who was appointed to be assistant U.S. attorney general by former President George H.W. Bush. He was later appointed to the FBI by former President George W. Bush. At the time, he was described in news reports as a “conservative Republican.”

“If there were conflicts that arose, because of Director Mueller or anybody employed by Director Mueller, we have a process within the [Justice Department] to take care of that,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein previously told Fox News.

Justice Department policy “prohibits the consideration of political affiliation in personnel matters involving career employees” -- meaning, an attorney on detail has a right to his or her own political beliefs.

Alleged surveillance abuses

Improper surveillance techniques were used by the Justice Department and FBI in the Russia investigation, Republican lawmakers alleged in a controversial memo in February.

EXPLAINED: FISA COURT, THE SUPER-SECRET PANEL THAT GRANTS SURVEILLANCE WARRANTS

The four-page memo, put together by staff of House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said a salacious but unverified dossier was key for the FBI to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on members of Trump’s team, including former Trump adviser Carter Page. Page has not been charged in the Mueller investigation.

However, Democrats on the committee denounced the memo and released their own rebuttal.

Texting scandal

Two former members of Mueller’s team raised eyebrows after their text messages regarding Trump, Clinton and the investigation were released. In the messages, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who were romantically involved, bashed Trump and discussed concerns about being too tough on Clinton during the investigation into her private email server. The pair exchanged some 50,000 text messages throughout the presidential election and first year of the Trump administration, many of them with anti-Trump sentiments.

EXPLAINED: STRZOK, PAGE AND THE FBI TEXTING SCANDAL

Strzok is a veteran counterintelligence agent who was assigned to both the investigation into Clinton’s emails and Mueller’s probe into possible collusion. He was reassigned to the FBI’s human resources division in August 2017. In a text message to Page, Strzok said he was hesitant to join Mueller’s team because of his “gut sense and concern there’s no big there there.”

Strzok also had a personal relationship with the judge who initially presided over Flynn’s case but recused himself just days after the former adviser pleaded guilty.

Page, too, served on Mueller’s team -- albeit briefly before returning to the FBI. In May, it was announced that Page had resigned from the FBI to “pursue other opportunities.”

Mueller and Rosenstein were reportedly told in July 2017 about their text messages.

Misleading donors

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi attempted to use the special prosecutor to cash in, claiming he was fired. The subject line of a fundraising email encouraging people to donate to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) read “Mueller FIRED.”

But the body of the email acknowledged that Mueller still had his job.

“I’m so furious I can barely write this email. President Trump is inches away from firing Robert Mueller and derailing the entire Russia investigation,” Pelosi said in the email.

What’s next

Trump has not yet been interviewed by Mueller or his team yet, but questions investigators have wished to ask the president have been leaked. The questions request information related to Comey, McCabe and his team’s connections to Russian officials.

Trump has indicated he would be willing to sit down with Mueller for an interview. Rudy Giuliani, one of the latest additions to the president’s legal team, has taken over talks with Mueller’s team about an interview.

WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF TRUMP IS SUBPOENAED BY MUELLER?

Giuliani said his objective “is to end this investigation and distraction from the critical issues facing our president as quickly as possible. The president has produced 1.2 million documents that is historically unprecedented. We believe it presents overwhelming proof that the president did not collude with regard to the 2016 election.”

“If anything else is needed, we will consider it if there is an open mind as to the merits,” he said, referring to the possibility of an interview.

Giuliani also told Fox News on Wednesday that Mueller told Trump’s team two weeks ago that he will follow DOJ guidance that a sitting president cannot be indicted.

Mueller already had told Trump’s legal team he is not a target of the investigation but is a subject -- which could change at any time. Mueller has suggested he could subpoena the president if needed, Trump’s former lead attorney John Dowd told The Associated Press.

Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, calling the investigation a “witch hunt.”

TRUMP’S LAWYERS HANDLING RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, FROM RUDY GIULIANI TO JAY SEKULOW

The investigation into Michael Cohen could also throw a wrench into the Mueller probe. Cohen, 51, is the president's personal attorney who previously worked for the Trump Organization. He is under a criminal investigation as part of a grand jury probe into his personal conduct and business dealings, including a $130,000 payment made in 2016 to adult film star Stormy Daniels for her silence regarding an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.

In April, the FBI raided Cohen’s home, office and hotel room and seized a number of documents. Investigators also sought bank records, information on Cohen’s dealings in the taxi industry and his communications with the Trump campaign.

Cohen has not been charged with anything. Trump said the raid made attorney-client privilege “a thing of the past.”

The House Intelligence Committee said in April it found “no evidence” of collusion. However, the heavily-redacted report did “find poor judgment and ill-considered actions by the Trump and Clinton campaigns.” Senate Intelligence Committee leaders, though, on Wednesday backed the original intelligence assessment finding that Russia tried to interfere in the elections, to boost Trump.

"At least three suspected rhino poachers have been killed by a pride of lions after they broke into a game reserve in South Africa.

Rangers discovered human remains around 4:30 p.m. local time on July 3 in the immediate vicinity of the lions’ territory at the Sibuya Game Reserve in Kenton-on-Sea in the Eastern Cape, more than 24 hours after an anti-poaching dog alerted her handler that something was amiss.

The ranger however did not examine the disturbance further because it was not unusual to hear the lions at night.

RHINO POACHERS SHOT DEAD IN RAIDS BY ARMED RANGERS IN SOUTH AFRICA

When members of the anti-poaching unit investigated, they recovered human remains, a high-powered rifle with a silencer, wire cutters, an axe and three pairs of shoes.

Nick Fox, the park’s owner, said the lions were shot with tranquilizer darts at first light so police forensic teams and the anti-poaching unit could comb the area for clues, and admitted it was not clear how many poachers may have been killed.

“The only body part we found was one skull and one bit of pelvis, everything else was completely gone,” he told Newsweek. “There is so little left that they don’t know exactly how many people were killed, we suspect three because we found three sets of shoes and three sets of gloves.”

He added: “They came heavily armed with hunting rifles and axes which we have recovered and enough food to last them for several days so we suspect they were after all of our rhinos here. But the lions are our watchers and guardians and they picked the wrong pride and became a meal.”

Police spokeswoman Captain Mali Govender said: “We do not know identities but firearms have been taken by the police and will be sent to the ballistics laboratory to see if they have been used in poaching before.”

In 2016, the reserve saw three of its rhinos shot dead by poachers who broke into the reserve to cut off their horns. All books with the reserve include an option Rhino Levy where the proceeds are donated to a fund fighting poaching.

SUDAN, THE WORLD'S LAST MALE NORTHERN WHITE RHINO, DIES

"The German government is under fire for betraying its pledge to combat anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial, in light of Berlin’s efforts to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran.

The criticism comes after Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, argued for a new world order without the U.S. as the leader.

In a hard-charging attack on the Trump administration, Maas said Germany “will not allow [the U.S.] to go over our heads, and at our expense.”

“It is therefore essential that we strengthen European autonomy by establishing payment channels independent of the US, a European monetary fund and an independent SWIFT [payments] system,” he wrote in German business daily Handelsblatt. “The devil is in thousands of details. But every day that the Iran [nuclear] agreement lasts, is better than the potentially explosive crisis that threatens the Middle East otherwise.”

His comments drew ire from Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of U.S. human rights organization of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

“Circumventing sanctions on an Iranian regime that is committed in word and deed to destroy Israel for financial gain for German companies makes a mockery of that [Berlin’s] commitment” to implement the lessons of the Holocaust, he told FoxNews.com.

IRAN PLOTS TERROR ON EUROPEAN SOIL AS EU TRIES TO SHIELD REGIME FROM TRUMP SANCTIONS PUSH

Cooper expressed regret that Maas appeared to be taking sides with the ayatollahs, because “The Wiesenthal Center knows Foreign Minister Maas as a friend of the Jewish community and a person who takes [to heart] the legacy and responsibility of the Nazi Holocaust.”

He added that “economic greed should not subvert the safety of German Jewry.”

Iran's regime under then-Iranian president and Holocaust denier Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that ""a world without America...is attainable.""

The US wants Iran cut off from SWIFT — the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication — to force Tehran to return to the negotiating table. Disconnection from the Brussels-based SWIFT, which facilitates cross-country payments, would deal a powerful blow to Iran’s struggling economy.

IRAN SANCTIONS ARE A GOOD START - NOW IT'S TIME TO RESTORE HUMAN RIGHTS TO ITS PEOPLE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE

The US withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in May because the agreement does not stop the regime from building nuclear weapons, bring an end to Iranian terrorism or advance American security interests, President Donald Trump said.

The Wiesenthal Center’s criticism of Maas, who said he went into politics because of Auschwitz, and the German government follows a call from Germany’s roughly 100,000-member Jewish umbrella organization for the end of Iranian-German trade.

Dr. Josef Schuster, the head of the Central Council of German Jews, said last week: “Any trade with Iran means a benefit for radical and terrorist forces and a hazard and destabilization for the region.”

He added: “It seems paradoxical that Germany — as a country that is said to have learned from its horrendous past and which has a strong commitment to fight anti-Semitism — is one of the strongest economic partners of a regime that is blatantly denying the Holocaust and abusing human rights on a daily basis.

“Besides, Germany has included Israel’s security as a part of its ‘raison d'etre.’

As a matter of course this should exclude doing business with a fanatic dictatorship that is calling for Israel’s destruction, pursuing nuclear weapons and financing terror organizations around the world.”

TRUMP REINSTATES IRAN SANCTIONS, SLAMS 'HORRIBLE' NUCLEAR DEAL

The Industry and Chamber of Commerce in Bonn/Rhein-Sieg in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia is slated to hold a conference promoting business with Iran on September 5, according to German newspaper Bild.

Approximately 120 German companies are active in Iran, with workers based in the Islamic Republic. There are 10,000 German businesses conducting business with Iran, and Germany exported $3.42 billion worth of goods to Iran in 2017.

The U.S government has urged German companies to wind down their business with the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Julie Lenarz, a Senior Fellow at The Israel Project in Washington, D.C., told FoxNews.com: “All governments should make trade ties with Iran contingent upon the Islamic Republic‘s end to its global sponsorship of terror, illicit nuclear ambitions and suppression of basic rights at home.”

She said the Iran deal “was a disaster — a patient pathway to the bomb — and the Trump administration did the only responsible thing reimposing sanctions, thereby putting pressure on the regime and forcing them back to the negotiation table on our terms.”

Lenarz added: “Europe, and Germany in particular, are throwing the mullah regime — confronted with an economy in free fall, a collapsing currency and rising popular dissent — a much needed lifeline by boycotting the sanctions. It makes them directly complicit in the crimes committed by Iran.”

If Iran wants the economic benefits of being a member of the international community, it should behave accordingly, or Germany should immediately end its immoral trade with Iran and support the long-suffering Iranian people in ending the clerical dictatorship.""

"President Trump on Friday blasted what he described as a media double standard on immigration, as he honored families whose loved ones were killed by illegal immigrants and accused the press of ignoring them to focus on the plight of migrants caught crossing the border.

After a week of saturation coverage on illegal immigrant parents separated from their children -- a policy Trump reversed under public and political pressure -- the president stressed that so-called Angel Families have been “permanently separated.”

The families, whose children and other relatives were killed by illegal immigrants, echoed that message during the White House event.

“You don’t hear these stories,” said Steve Ronnebeck, whose 21-year-old son Grant was killed by an illegal immigrant over a pack of cigarettes. “But this is permanent separation.”

The family members joined Trump and Vice President Pence at the event Friday, holding photos of their departed loved ones.

“These are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones. The word you have to think about is ‘permanently,’” Trump said Friday. “Because they were killed by illegal immigrants. These are the families that the media ignores. This is a very unfair situation.”

The president was making a clear attempt to underscore the stakes in his push to crack down on illegal immigration, while countering critical media coverage.

His administration's tough ""zero tolerance"" policies seeking prosecution for all illegal border crossers spurred bipartisan outrage this week, as images and accounts emerged of families being separated as a result. Trump backed off by signing an executive order this week allowing families to stay together during these proceedings, while the status of such enforcement efforts remains unclear.

Trump, though, accused the media and Democratic lawmakers of ignoring the other side of the issue -- drug crimes, MS-13 gang activity and killings like the ones that tore apart the families that visited the White House on Friday.

“They don’t want to discuss, they don’t want to hear, they don’t want to see,” Trump said. “No major news networks go to their homes or put images of their loved ones on the nightly news.”

Trump added: “Where is the media outrage over the catch and release policy? Where is the condemnation of Democrats in sanctuary cities that release violent criminals into our communities?”

Trump praised the Angel Families, calling them “brave Americans.”

""Your loss will not have been in vain,"" Trump said. ""We will secure our borders and we will make sure they are properly taken care of. The word will get out. We’re going to have a safe country.""

One Angel mother, Laura Wilkerson, took the stage following the president’s remarks, describing the loss of her 18-year-old son Josh in 2010.

“Josh was brutally tortured, strangled over and over, set on fire after death. His last hours were brutal. None of our kids had a minute to say goodbye,” Wilkerson said. “We weren’t lucky enough to be separated for five days or 10 days. We are separated permanently.”

Wilkerson said when she wants to see her son, “we go to the cemetery.”

“This is permanent separation,” Wilkerson said. “It’s the media that won’t share it with other people. Thankfully I will see him again in heaven.”

While Trump stresses the importance of securing the border, efforts in Congress to pass a sweeping immigration bill are faltering.

House Republicans have pushed off a vote on a key bill until next week, but Trump on Friday threw another wrench into the process by suggesting they should ""stop wasting their time"" until after the midterms.

GOP lawmakers are still pressing ahead with attempts to bring legislation to the floor next week.",politics
"President Trump on Saturday took aim at social media tech giants for “discriminating” against Republicans and conservatives -- saying that “too many voices are being destroyed” and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen.

“Who is making the choices, because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made. Let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!” he said at the end of a lengthy post on Twitter.

Both Facebook and Twitter have been under fire for allegedly censoring accounts, while ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users. Trump in the past has referred to alleged “shadow banning” by Twitter as “discriminatory and illegal.”

Trump uses Twitter on a daily basis, and his campaign was credited for its use of Facebook as one of the ways it secured its victory in November 2016.

While conservatives have complained for years about what they say is discrimination by the tech giants, the controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported the issue, saying that accounts from top Republicans including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel were being given limited visibility on Twitter. Twitter at the time said it was an algorithmic glitch that has since been fixed.

""We do not shadow ban. You are always able to see the tweets from accounts you follow (although you may have to do more work to find them, like go directly to their profile). And we certainly don’t shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology,"" the tech giant said in a statement.

""We do rank tweets and search results. We do this because Twitter is most useful when it’s immediately relevant. These ranking models take many signals into consideration to best organize tweets for timely relevance,"" the statement said. ""We must also address bad-faith actors who intend to manipulate or detract from healthy conversation.""

TWITTER SLAMMED FOR 'SHADOW BANNING' PROMINENT REPUBLICANS

A Facebook executive apologized last month for mistreating Diamond and Silk -- two pro-Trump personalities who have long claimed they are being censored by the platform, but the company has also denied being biased against conservatives.

“We badly mishandled our communications with them,” Monika Bickert, head of Global Policy Management at Facebook, said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing.

But that has done little to calm the controversy, and Trump on Saturday accused social media sites of “closing down the opinions of many people on the right, while at the same time doing nothing to others.”

""Too many voices are being destroyed, some good & some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen,"" he tweeted.

He went on to call censorship “a dangerous thing” and then took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, saying that while they are “fake,” he does not demand that offending content be taken off air.

“If you are weeding out Fake News, there is nothing so Fake as CNN & MSNBC, & yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed,” he tweeted. “I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt, or don’t watch at all..”

"Shakespeare warned “Beware the Ides of March” in Julius Caesar. March 15th, to be exact.

But if the Bard were writing about the news business, he may write “Beware of August.”

August is but four weeks. But most who cover the news know that August is often the most-volatile month on the calendar.

I mean, can you name another month where a herd of goats escaped and marauded around a major American city?

Case closed.

The political news is often the zaniest in August. That’s weird because the House and Senate are typically out of session for at least a good chunk of the month. Such is the case again this August. But nothing can exist in a vacuum. Hence, where the strange political news unfolds.

Consider this month. The American political world focused on central Ohio. Republican Troy Balderson faced Democrat Danny O’Connor in a special election to succeed former Rep. Pat Tiberi, R-Ohio, who resigned. The results remain too close to call. Observers view this contest as an intriguing barometer by which to gauge the American electorate right before the midterm elections this fall.

Then, the arrest of Rep. Chris Collins, R-NY, on securities fraud.

Consider the other major political landmarks in August.

President Warren Harding died unexpectedly in San Francisco in August, 1923.

President Truman ordered nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August, 1945, effectively ending World War II.

The East German government split Berlin in August, 1961, with the 12-foot Berlin Wall.

Congress approved the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in August, 1964 following the attack on two American destroyers by North Vietnam. The vote solidified the country’s entrance into the Vietnam conflict.

Martin Luther King delivered his “I Have a Dream Speech” on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington in August, 1963.

President Nixon resigned in August, 1974, facing likely removal from office by the Senate amid Watergate.

The calendar still read August 31 when the Soviets shot down a South Korean commercial jetliner in August, 1983. The incident killed 269 people on board, including Rep. Larry McDonald, R-Ga. Some historians wonder how the incident didn’t spark World War III.

Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, 1990. That led to the Gulf War in 1991. The U.S. has been involved in Iraq ever since.

Soviet hardliners staged a brief coup in August, 1991, removing Mikhail Gorbachev from power. The Soviet Union crumbled by the end of the year.

Hurricane Katrina whipped the Gulf Coast in August, 2005. The storm forever altered the trajectory of President George W. Bush.

Raucous Congressional town hall meetings over health care punctuated August, 2009, giving rise to the tea party. The tea party movement helped propel Republicans to power in the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterms, serving as a check on President Obama.

Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., died in August, 2009.

Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, died in a tragic plane crash in Alaska a year later, in August, 2010.

In August, 2011, Congress struggled to approve a debt ceiling increase to sidestep an economic catastrophe. But bigger news actually hijacked the House vote to increase the debt limit that month: The triumphant return to Congress by then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., shot in the head earlier that year.

Standard and Poor’s downgraded the credit rating of the U.S. a few weeks later - the first such move in history.

Not many Augusts were as crazy as August, 2011. A magnitude 5.8 earthquake even rocked Washington that year. The temblor did minor damage to Congressional buildings.

The Senate was forced to meet that day in a federal building just a few blocks from the Capitol. The Architect of the Capitol and fire marshal conducted a safety check of the building. It marked one of the few times either the House or Senate met outside the U.S. Capitol in more than 200 years. Congress met at Federal Hall in New York in 2002 to mark the anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks a year prior. Congress met in Philadelphia in 1987 to observe the bicentennial of the Constitution. Congress regularly convened in New York and Philadelphia prior to the 19th Century.

And last August, there was the major conflagration over race in Charlottesville, VA. Critics decried President Trump’s remarks about the melee on August 15th - “Ides of August.”

Both political parties often hold their quadrennial nominating conventions in August. That alone constitutes a trove of political news.

And there are also the “non” political stories which commandeer the August news cycle: The Beatles played their legendary concert at Shea Stadium in August, 1965. Hippies and rock music lovers gathered at Max Yasgur’s farm in Upstate New York in August, 1969 for Woodstock. Elvis Presley died in August, 1977. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bart Giammati banned Pete Rose from the game in August, 1989. Princess Diana died in August, 1997. A major commuter bridge in Minneapolis collapsed in August, 2007.

So what lurks this behind the calendar this month? A verdict in Paul Manafort’s federal trial? More indictments by Special Counsel Robert Mueller? Maneuvers by the House Freedom Caucus regarding efforts to impeach or hold Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in contempt of Congress over the Russia probe? Drama about the next Speaker of the House or Congressional leadership races on both sides of the aisle? Are there more questions surrounding what Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, knew regarding alleged sexual abuse when when he was an assistant wrestling coach 30 years ago at Ohio State University? Developments in the trade war over tariffs? Another threat by the President to shutter the government over his border wall? Issues about immigration and family separations? A dustup with North Korea?

And don’t forget: the Senate is taking an abbreviated break this month. Senators will return on August 15 to address a defense spending bill and other nominations. There’s a big fight over documents regarding the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.

To most, August is just a month on the calendar. But reporters know otherwise.

Just look at at what happened with the goats.

"The archbishop of Philadelphia has asked Pope Francis to cancel a bishops' conference focusing on youth in the wake of the child sex abuse crisis roiling the Catholic Church.

A spokesman for the archdiocese confirmed Saturday that Archbishop Charles Chaput made the request by letter, but he declined further comment, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

The Youth Synod, which would include bishops from the around the world, has been planned for two years and its website says it is to be focused on ""young people, the faith and vocational discernment."" An international panel of young people is expected to join the council of bishops for the event.

""I have written the Holy Father and called on him to cancel the forthcoming synod on young people,"" Chaput said at a conference Thursday at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, according to LifeSite News, a conservative Catholic website. ""Right now, the bishops would have absolutely no credibility in addressing this topic.""

Instead, Chaput asked that the synod be refocused on the life of bishops.

A nearly 900-page grand jury report released last month said more than 300 Catholic priests abused at least a thousand children over the past seven decades in six Pennsylvania dioceses, and senior figures in the church hierarchy systematically covered up complaints.

A description of the purpose of the Oct. 3-28 synod at the Vatican begins ""Taking care of young people is not an optional task for the Church, but an integral part of her vocation and mission in history.""

"Two Malaysian Muslim women convicted under Islamic laws of attempting to have sexual relations were caned Monday in a rare public whipping that was slammed by rights activists as a grave miscarriage of justice.

Lawyers and activists said the women, aged 22 and 32, were seated on stools facing the judges and given six strokes from a light rattan cane on their backs by female prison officers. More than 100 people witnessed the caning in a Shariah courtroom in northeast Terengganu state, they said.

Muslim Lawyers' Association deputy president Abdul Rahim Sinwan said unlike caning under civil laws, the punishment under Islamic laws isn't painful or harsh and was meant to educate the women so they will repent. The women, dressed in white headscarves and clothing, didn't cry or scream but ""showed remorse,"" he said.

""Repentance is the ultimate aim for their sin,"" he said.

Human rights groups slammed the punishment as a setback to human rights and said it could worsen discrimination against people in Malaysia's lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender community.

""Caning is a form of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and may amount to torture,"" Amnesty International Malaysia said in a statement. ""People should not live in fear because they are attracted to people of the same sex. The Malaysian authorities must immediately repeal repressive laws, outlaw torturous punishments and ratify the U.N. Convention Against Torture.""

Malaysia follows a dual-track justice system. Nearly two-thirds of Malaysia's 31 million people are Muslims, who are governed by Islamic courts in family, marriage and personal issues. The two unidentified women were discovered by Islamic officials in April and sentenced last month by a Shariah court to six strokes of a cane and a fine after pleading guilty.

Thilaga Sulathireh, from the group Justice for Sisters who witnessed the caning, said she was shocked by the public spectacle. She said Malaysian laws were inconsistent because civil laws prohibit corporal punishment against female prisoners.

""It's a regression of human rights in Malaysia. It's not about the severity of the caning. Corporal punishment is a form of torture regardless of your intention,"" she said.

Malaysia is seen as a moderate and stable Muslim-majority country, but Islamic conservatism is on the rise.

The caning occurred amid a climate of fear and discrimination against Malaysia's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. A few weeks ago, authorities removed the portraits of two LGBT rights activists from a public exhibition. Malaysia religious minister Mujahid Yusuf later said the government doesn't support the promotion of LGBT culture. A transgender woman was also beaten up by a group of people in a southern state this month.",world

A powerful earthquake rocked Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido early Thursday, triggering landslides that crushed homes, knocking out power and forcing a nuclear power plant to switch to a backup generator.

The magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck southern Hokkaido at 3:08 a.m. at the depth of 24 miles, Japan's Meteorological Agency said. The epicenter was east of the city of Tomakomai but the shaking buckled roads and damaged homes in Hokkaido's prefectural capital of Sapporo, with a population of 1.9 million.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference that two people had been confirmed dead. He did not give details.

Japan is used to dealing with disasters, but the last few months have brought a string of calamities. The quake came on the heels of a typhoon that wreaked havoc in western Japan, leaving the main airport near Osaka and Kobe closed after a tanker rammed a bridge connecting the facility to the mainland. The summer also brought devastating floods from torrential rains in Hiroshima and deadly hot temperatures across the country.

The Japanese national broadcaster NHK, citing its own tally, reported that 125 people were injured and nearly 40 are feared missing. Hokkaido's local disaster agency put the number of injured at 48.

Several people were reported missing in the nearby town of Atsuma, where a massive landslide engulfed homes in an avalanche of soil, rocks and timber.

Reconstruction Minister Jiro Akama told reporters that five people were believed to be buried in the town's Yoshino district. Some of the 40 people stranded there were airlifted to safer grounds, NHK said.

Aerial views showed dozens of landslides in the surrounding area, with practically every mountainside a raw slash of brown amid deep green forest.

Airports and many roads on the island were closed following the early morning quake. NHK showed workers rushing to clean up shattered glass and reinstall ceiling panels that had tumbled down in the region's biggest airport at Chitose.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that 25,000 troops and other personnel would be dispatched to the area to help with rescue operations.

NHK showed the moment the quake struck the city of Muroran, with its camera violently shaking and all city lights going black moment later. In Sapporo, a mudslide on a road left several cars half buried.

Power was knocked out for Hokkaido's 2.9 million households. Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters that the extensive power outage was caused by an emergency shutdown of the main thermal power plant at Tomato Atsuma that supplies half of Hokkaido's electricity.

The hope had been to get power back up ""within a few hours,"" Seko said. However, damage to three generators at the Tomato Atsuma plant means that the restoration of power could take more than a week.

Seko said utilities were planning to start up several other thermal and hydroelectric plants to provide at least some power. Altogether peak demand on the island averages 3.8 million kilowatts, stopgap supplies from smaller plants and from the nearby Tohoku region could bring supplies up to 2.9 million kilowatts within days, Seko said. However, that would leave a shortfall of roughly 900,000 kilowatts, causing inconveniences to many in Hokkaido.

In the meantime, authorities sent power-generator vehicles to hospitals so enable them to treat emergency patients, he said.

Reacting quickly to the disaster, troops deployed water tanker trucks in Sapporo, where residents were collecting bottles to tide them over until electricity and tap water supplies come back online.

The quake's impact was widespread. To the north, in the scenic town of Biei, residents lined up outside of supermarkets and convenience stores, quickly clearing shelves of water, toilet paper and food.

""Only a few cartons of instant ramen were left,"" said Mika Takeda, who lives in the town of 10,000. The one local gas station was limiting customers to only 20 liters (5 gallons) of gas, she said.

As Japan's northern frontier and a major farming region with rugged mountain ranges and vast forests, Hokkaido is an area where residents are used to coping with long winters, isolation and other hardships. But the blackouts brought on by the quake underscore the country's heavy reliance on vulnerable power systems: without electricity, water was cut to many homes, train lines were idled and phone systems stopped in some areas.

Suga said authorities were doing their utmost to rescue and assess damage after receiving hundreds of calls about people missing and buildings collapsing.",world

When a lowly Roman Catholic father rebels against the church hierarchy, publicly castigating a prominent cardinal's handling of child sex-abuse cases, is that an act of backstabbing against the institution he serves or a brave solo effort to help save it?

That is the debate provoked by the actions of a priest in France, with his remarkable step of petitioning the cardinal to resign. Judging from the sheaf of letters and cards that Rev. Pierre Vignon is clutching in his soft, plump hands, his uprising has divided churchgoers.

To hate-mailers, the previously anonymous 64-year-old propelled into the spotlight by his online petition launched two weeks ago is an attention-grabbing egomaniac who is courting disaster by taking on the influential archbishop of the southeastern city of Lyon.

But mostly, Vignon says, those writing to him are supportive. They include people who have themselves been abused by predator priests. He plucks one such ""thank you"" card from the pile and reads out loud.

""Because of you I want to go back to church,"" its author wrote. ""When I do, I will think of the victims.""

Vignon clearly relishes being at the center of the storm, with reporters now beating a path to the Vercors plateau in southeastern France where the portly priest ministers.

The Vercors' mountain villages and choppy terrain were centers of French resistance against Nazi occupation in World War II. Vignon says he had family members in the resistance and that the region's freedom-fighting history helped inspire his own decision to break ranks and call publicly for the resignation of Philippe Barbarin, archbishop of Lyon since 2002. Vignon faults the cardinal's handling of a notorious alleged pedophile priest suspected of abusing Lyon boy scouts in the 1980s.

""I have always been unmanageable,"" Vignon says proudly. ""There comes a moment when one has to say 'No! No more, that's enough!' That's what I said: 'Enough.'""

On this day, Vignon is particularly buoyant because his petition on change.org has just garnered its 100,000th signature, a milestone that heaps more pressure on church leaders to choose sides. After clambering out of his hoarse-sounding Fiat Panda, Vignon whipped out his mobile phone to show how a friend texted him blow-by-blow updates: 99,980 signatures, 99,990, 99,995, and, finally, four minutes later, 100,000.

""Champagne!!"" messaged another friend.

With a glint in his eye, Vignon couldn't help but gloat.

""I don't know if Cardinal Barbarin will forgive me this joke, but he has such colossal energy, which I don't have, that he is often nicknamed 'The 100,000-volt cardinal.' Now, unfortunately, he's going to become the 100,000-vote cardinal,'"" Vignon said.

Barbarin and other church officials are due in court in January to answer victims' charges that they were aware of the Lyon priest's alleged history of abuse and didn't alert authorities. Barbarin has denied any attempt to cover up the case and has been supported as ""brave"" by Pope Francis.

Francis, too, is facing resignation calls over accusations by a former Vatican ambassador that he covered up for American ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick.

Further evidence that Rome's mounting cover-up scandal is going global: Several weeks ago, an Australian bishop was convicted and sentenced to a year of home detention for failing to report a pedophile to police. And a Chilean cardinal was summoned to give testimony in a sex-abuse cover-up investigation.

Vignon says he's had no indication that Barbarin even read his open letter. In it, the priest of 38 years argued that ""we are at one of those crucial hours in history where great acts are required"" and asked Barbarin: ""You yourself acknowledged management mistakes. Why would you remain in place indefinitely having made them?""

The petition hasn't prompted Barbarin to resign, but it has exposed fissures in the French church. Those who have spoken in support of Barbarin include Vignon's own boss, Valence bishop Pierre-Yves Michel. Michel and another French bishop wrote in church newspaper La Croix that Barbarin shouldn't resign and described attacks against him as an ""ideological settling of scores.""

""I have violated the unwritten law that one shouldn't make waves,"" Vignon says. ""Because of that I've received quite a bit of criticism from some colleagues and somewhat traditional and conservative churchgoers.""

But he says dealing with abuse and its aftermath must be the church's priority.

""We can't say 'God loves you' when there are such somber sordid stories that make one feel sick and uncomfortable. No. No. At this point, the abscess must be punctured, treated and healed,"" he says.

Vignon's supporters include a group of alleged victims of Rev. Bernard Preynat, the Lyon priest under criminal investigation on preliminary charges of sexual assaults on minors. Preynat, now in his 70s, confessed wrongdoings in letters to victims' parents and meetings with his superiors, including Barbarin. His last known abuses were in 1991.

Francois Devaux, president of the ""La Parole Liberee"" (Lift the Burden of Silence) group, says Vignon took a risk in going public because he would have looked ""a bit stupid"" had his petition garnered few signatures.

""For the first time, a cleric is asking himself the question: 'What about me? What is my stance in this?'"" he said. ""It is a courageous act. And that shows up the passive complicity, the passive responsibility of others.""

He believes the success of Vignon's petition could be a turning point in French church attitudes to abuse. After the petition surged past 100,000 signatures, Devaux got an unsolicited call that same evening from a ""very, very worried"" bishop asking ""what can we do?"" Devaux wouldn't name the bishop.

""The church, or some people in the church, high up, are starting to realize how serious the situation is,"" he said.

"The suspect in a car ramming outside Parliament that was being treated as a terror incident has been named as Salih Khater, according to British media reports Wednesday.

Khater, a 29-year-old British citizen, is originally from Sudan, the BBC reported. He was being questioned by authorities in south London on suspicion of preparing an act of terror.

According to the Press Association, a Facebook page for a man of the same name says he lives in Birmingham, works as a shop manager, and has studied at Sudan University of Science and Technology.

A car plowed into cyclists and crashed outside Parliament on Tuesday. Two people were hospitalized and one person was released, Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said. A woman was also being treated for serious, but non-life threatening injuries, he said.

The BBC reported that while the suspect wasn’t believed to be on MI5 or counterterrorism police’s radar, he was known to local police.

A motive has not been uncovered, but counterterrorism investigators suspect the incident is Britain’s fourth vehicle attack in 18 months.

"Editor's note: This op-ed is based on the author’s book “The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.”

Director James Comey knew the FBI was incorruptible. This is precisely why he seized control of the investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s email practices covering her time as secretary of state, instead of allowing the FBI field office to conduct the probe.

By commandeering control of the investigation, Comey and his confederates could twist the facts and contort the law to dictate the outcome they desired. Clinton was the beneficiary of what FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe reportedly described as the “HQ special.”

The same is true of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. The very people who cleared Clinton of crimes – despite strong evidence that she broke the law – also assumed unfettered authority over the so-called “collusion” investigation to determine if Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with Russia to help Trump become president.

Bereft of probable cause and credible evidence, they nevertheless pursued Trump in a probe designed to damage his candidacy – and later to destroy his presidency in an effort to overturn the results of the 2016 presidential election.

It was not just Comey and his abettors at the FBI who conjured this illicit scheme. There were others outside the walls of the J. Edgar Hoover Building who were both instrumental and complicit.

Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee furnished the necessary funds. Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS acted as the facilitator. And ex-British spy Christopher Steele provided the fabricated “dossier” that served as a pretext for launching the investigation of Trump.

This brings us to the steps of the Justice Department and a high-ranking official who was essential to the scheme.

Bruce Ohr

Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr bypassed his superiors at the Justice Department and worked covertly with Steele to exploit what became known as the “Steele dossier.” Sixty-three pages of texts, emails and handwritten notes show extensive contacts between Ohr and Steele both before and after the election.

Even after Steele was fired by the FBI for lying about his contacts with reporters, Ohr maintained intensive communications with Steele. The former British spy kept feeding his bogus information while simultaneously fretting to Ohr that his actions might be “exposed.”

It was a direct violation of FBI procedures to use a discredited source who had also broken an agreement with the FBI. To circumvent its rules, the bureau used Ohr as a conduit to continue its relationship with Steele.

It appears that Ohr would communicate with Steele, then endeavor to pass on the information to the FBI. Peter Strzok, the FBI’s lead investigator in the Trump-Russia probe, confirmed in his congressional testimony that “the FBI received documents and material from Mr. Ohr.”

Ohr knew that Steele was a nefarious and unreliable character. Records show that in September of 2016 Steele told Ohr that he was “desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.”

Given such an acute bias and motivation to lie, all contact with Steele should have been terminated and his “dossier” tossed in the garbage. However, both Ohr and the FBI were determined to use Steele and his unverified documents to damage Trump.

It is important to note that Steele was not only receiving money from the Clinton campaign. He was also on the payroll of the FBI from January 1, 2016 to November 1, 2016. Records obtained by Judicial Watch through a lawsuit reveal that he was paid eleven times when he met with the FBI.

Thus, it appears the FBI and Clinton’s campaign were working in concert to use a discredited source, who composed a fictitious document to harm her political opponent in the 2016 election.

Ironically, Clinton and her campaign are not being investigated for violating campaign laws. Her payments to a foreign source constituted a “thing of value” which is illegal under the Federal Election Campaign Act. In egregious cases like this one, it is a crime.

Juxtapose Clinton’s actions to the recent accusations against President Trump for personally funding payments that were perfectly legal under election laws. The disparity of treatment proves that equal justice under the law is a charade when partisan politics prevail.

Documents also show that Steele kept feeding the FBI allegations about Trump – even after Trump became president – all the way through May 15, 2017. Why? It is reasonable to conclude that the FBI was desperate to verify the unverified “dossier.” The material from Steele served as the basis for launching its Trump-Russia investigation and the foundation of its warrant to wiretap a Trump campaign associate.

Having violated FBI regulations by using unverified information in a warrant application and thereby committing a fraud on the court, the FBI was hoping to cure its wrongdoing belatedly. It’s called covering your tracks.

It is not surprising the FBI was never able to corroborate or substantiate anything contained in the “dossier.” In British court documents, Steele was forced to admit under oath that his claims against Trump were derived from “raw intelligence” based on “limited intelligence” – casting doubt on their veracity.

Steele further acknowledged that his accusations were “unverifiable.” In other words, the “dossier” was so poorly sourced that it was inherently untrustworthy. The contents were based on triple and quadruple hearsay from “anonymous” sources that probably never existed in the first place. It was a clever illusion.

In a veiled reference to the partisan motivations behind his report, Steele cautioned that “its contents must be critically viewed in light of the purpose for and circumstances in which the information was collected.”

This was a subtle way for Steele to confess that his work was not worth the paper on which it was written. In plain language, it was an untruthful political attack intended to vilify an opposing candidate – Donald Trump. Ohr and the FBI plainly knew this. They didn’t care.

Nellie Ohr

Bruce Ohr was peddling the false Steele document while benefiting from it financially. His wife, Nellie Ohr, worked on the “dossier” as an employee of Fusion GPS and was getting paid to do so by the Clinton campaign. Money was going into the Ohrs’ bank account at the same time Bruce Ohr was using his position at the Justice Department to advance this false intelligence document.

Since his wife worked for Fusion GPS and contributed to the “dossier,” the relationship presented a disqualifying conflict of interest for Ohr. He was legally obligated under Justice Department regulations to recuse himself from any investigation in which his wife was involved.

Ohr did not seek a waiver of the conflict of interest. Instead, he omitted this information. Upon joining the Justice Department, he had signed an agreement stating that he would be fired for violating its rules. Inexplicably, he was not terminated, which only reinforces the impression that impropriety and concealment continued at the highest levels of the department.

Not only did Bruce Ohr fail to disclose that Fusion GPS was paying his wife, but it appears he did not fully report the nature of the work performed in financial disclosure reports as required under Justice Department regulations. Willfully filing a false government report constitutes a crime under federal law – specifically 8 U.S.C. (United States Code) 1001.

It is also against the law to use a public official for personal financial gain. This runs afoul of the federal bribery and gratuity statutes (18 U.S.C. 201-b and 18 U.S.C. 201-c) and is a violation of the honest services fraud statute (18 U.S. C. 1346). These are serious felonies. Yet, there appears to be no known investigation of Ohr by the Justice Department, where he is still employed.

Jeff Sessions

Is it any wonder that President Trump continues to express impatience, disgust and frustration with Attorney General Jeff Sessions?

Sessions has failed to take aggressive action against those who appear to have broken the law with impunity. He ignored pleas from members of Congress to reopen the Clinton email case, including her destruction of documents under congressional subpoena.

There is no investigation of Clinton’s payments to a foreigner who was using Russian sources for the “dossier”. The actions of Comey, McCabe, Strzok and others should have been presented to a grand jury. Abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to gain wiretap warrants should have been pursued.

Instead, of doing these things, Sessions spent months obstructing Congress by refusing to produce documents in response to lawful subpoenas.

Sessions’ only real achievement as attorney general has been to alienate his boss by his actions and inactions. President Trump was right when he said that choosing Sessions as attorney general was one of the “worst” decision he made.

Sessions should take the hint. When you have lost the confidence and trust of the president, it is time to resign. In the alternative, President Trump should finally accept the letter of resignation that his attorney general submitted in May of last year. There was no time limit on the letter. It can be accepted at the president’s pleasure.

If not now, then Sessions should go after the midterm elections. Expect to see Sessions standing outside the Justice Department with a box of his office tchotchkes. I’m betting it does not include the Scales of Justice.",politics
"Michael Cohen's plea deal chucked a live political grenade into the debate over President Trump's legal exposure – but that debate is far from settled, as experts clash over whether his implication of the president in campaign finance violations will amount to anything.

The president’s former longtime personal attorney and self-described “fixer” entered a guilty plea with federal prosecutors on Tuesday, admitting to violating campaign finance laws by arranging hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal “at the direction” of then-candidate Trump.

Trump, though, claimed the move to pay off the two women was not a crime -- while suggesting such allegations can be settled by fine.

“Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.

Trump was referring to former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, which was fined $375,000 by the Federal Election Commission for a series of missing notices for more than 1,300 contributions. They totaled $1.8 million.

But Lanny Davis, Cohen’s attorney, argued there is little room for interpretation here.

“There is no question that he’s committed a federal crime,” Davis told Fox News' “America’s Newsroom” on Wednesday. He also argued that it's never been settled whether a sitting president can be indicted, despite suggestions to the contrary from Trump allies.

Davis added that his client, under oath on Tuesday, admitted to making the “donations to keep quiet two women” at Trump's direction.

At issue is a $130,000 hush money payment made by Cohen to Daniels in the weeks leading up to the presidential election in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump, and the McDougal case, where she was paid $150,000 by the parent company of the National Enquirer for her story about an alleged 2006 affair with Trump, which it never published. Cohen admitted Tuesday to making an excessive campaign contribution and causing an unlawful corporate contribution.

“Mr. Trump wasn’t willing to sign those checks himself. He directed Mr. Cohen to make those hush money payments, [which is] a federal crime,” Davis said. “If Michael Cohen agreed to that, then certainly Donald Trump is guilty of the same crime.”

But former commissioner at the Federal Election Commission, Hans von Spakovsky, said that Cohen’s decision to plead guilty does not necessarily mean Trump violated the law.

“This is not a violation because this was not a campaign-related offense,” Spakovsky told Fox News on Wednesday. “Yes, Cohen pleaded guilty to it, yeah Cohen paid it, but then Cohen was reimbursed by Trump.”

The plea deal states that the payments were in fact meant to influence the election, though that could be argued by Trump's lawyers if it ever came to that. Spakovsky said Trump had a history of making these kinds of payments before he was a candidate.

Further, Spakovsky said ""a candidate can spend as much of their own money as they want to—even if it was a campaign-related expense.”

Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, a frequent defender of the president, made a similar argument.

“You have to show that it’s a crime,” he told “Fox & Friends.” He said it’s “not a crime” for a candidate like Trump to contribute to his own campaign, and probably not even a crime to direct someone else to contribute if he plans to pay that back.

Further, Dershowitz said, “The only evidence that the president did anything that might be unlawful … comes from a man who’s admitted to be a liar.”

“There are a lot of barriers,” he said, “We’re far away from [an] impeachable offense or a criminal offense on the part of the president.”

Richard Painter, former White House chief ethics counsel under former President George W. Bush, said that while Cohen’s guilty plea gives Trump “exposure” to criminal prosecution, these types of cases “can be difficult to win.”

Painter, who ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for U.S. Senate in Minnesota this month, cited the case of former vice presidential nominee John Edwards as “precedent.” Edwards was indicted in 2011 on charges of using illegal campaign donations to conceal an extra-marital affair to prevent his run for the White House from capsizing. Edwards, ultimately, was acquitted on one count and the jury deadlocked on others.

“It is not entirely clear how these cases turn out, as we found out with Edwards,” Painter told Fox News. He added, though, that he felt the Cohen-Trump payments were “more serious” than former President Bill Clinton lying about Monica Lewinsky, as ""campaign finance is more important to our democracy than the president lying under oath in a civil case.""

Painter added that while there is “potential criminal liability,” it is “not cut and dry.” He suggested Trump's problems go beyond Cohen.

“If you had a president with no other legal problems, who just had the Cohen problem, I would say the outcome of a criminal trial for Trump, based on that alone, is a maybe, maybe not situation,” Painter explained. “But Trump’s problem is not just this. He has the whole Russia thing. He has two big problems. One, is what his own involvement or knowledge of collusion was, and the second, where he has much more exposure, and is digging his own grave, is obstruction of justice.”

Trump has denied any collusion with Russia in the election and continues to call the special counsel probe a witch hunt.

Professor of law at George Washington University Jonathan Turley, though, said Trump could end up an ""unindicted co-conspirator"" in the Cohen matter.

On Wednesday, he agreed that the Cohen plea alone would not make “a particularly strong case,” but suggested there's more to come.

“You have the president’s lawyer implicating him in a federal crime. How Trump responds to that is going to be very key,” Turley said on “America’s Newsroom” Wednesday. “But the Justice Department certifies that they believe these allegations are accurate. That should be quite chilling, because this isn’t some immaculate crime committed by Cohen alone.”

Turley said that federal prosecutors, now, will likely pursue other “collateral or central players.”",politics
"Former CIA Director John Brennan on Friday escalated his war of words with President Trump -- agreeing with HBO host Bill Maher than Trump’s presidency “is the third great crisis in American history” behind the Revolutionary War and Civil War.



“I think we are in a crisis that is the third great crisis in American history,” Maher said on ""Real Time,"" saying that he felt it was more of a crisis than the Depression but behind the Revolutionary War and Civil War. “Would you rank the crisis we’re in now that way?”



“I would,” Brennan said. “And I think it’s going to get worse before it gets better, because don’t forget: Donald Trump has the authority of the president of the United States in his hands, in terms of what he can do domestically here and as well as what he can do internationally to try to distract attention, whether or not he’s going to try to pursue some type of foreign adventure, military or otherwise.”



Trump yanked Brennan’s security clearance last week, with the White House claiming that Brennan had been “leveraging” the clearance” to make “wild outbursts” about the Trump administration.



Brennan, who joined NBC News and MSNBC in February as a contributor and senior national security and intelligence adviser, has not held back in his criticism of Trump. On his Twitter account, he had called Trump’s behavior at a press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July “nothing short of treasonous.”

TRUMP AGAIN BLASTS EX-SPYMASTER BRENNAN AS 'POLITICAL HACK' WHO 'CANNOT BE TRUSTED' WITH SECRETS



On Friday, he defended the remark by saying he thought he had “exhausted all the other adjectives in the English language to describe Donald Trump’s failures to fulfill his responsibilities as president of the United States.



“I saw him on that stage in Helsinki failing to be able to say to the world and to Vladimir Putin that Russia tried to interfere in our election, that it never should have happened and it never should happen again, and if it does Russia is going to pay some very severe consequences as a result, but he didn’t do that,” he said.



He also denied that the basis for the revocation of his clearance was “bogus” and described the politicalization of security clearances as “a real threat to our national security.”



Brennan accused Trump of being “the typical authoritarian who is trying to control power” and said “the walls are closing in on him,” in terms of FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.



Trump has been no less scathing in his remarks about Brennan. Last week he said that Brennan will “go down as easily the WORST in history & since getting out, he has become nothing less than a loudmouth, partisan, political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!”



While a number of intelligence officials have backed Brennan, others have criticized him, with retired Adm. Michael Mullen saying that Brennan’s anti-Trump remarks risked damaging the intelligence community.



""I think John's an extraordinary servant of the country, but I think he has been incredibly critical of the president, and I think that has put him in a political place which actually does more damage for the intelligence community -- which is apolitical,"" Mullen said on “Fox News Sunday.”

However, Mullen also expressed concern about Trump’s decision to revoke Brennan’s clearance.

""For someone of my age, it brings back the whole concept of the 'enemies list' under President Nixon,"" Mullen said. ""And even before that, in the early 1950s, the McCarthy era -- where the administration starts putting together lists of individuals who don't agree with them.""

Brazil's top electoral court on Friday began debating whether jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva — the campaign front-runner — will be able to run in October's presidential election or be barred due to a corruption conviction.

The first of the seven judges cast a vote against da Silva, but it wasn't clear if the full court would reach a decision before adjourning for the night.

The left-leaning da Silva, who was hugely popular when he left office in 2010, started serving a 12-year-sentence for corruption and money laundering in April. By law, the former president is barred from running since his conviction has already been upheld by one appeals court.

However the former president and his Workers' Party argue he should be able to run while he pursues further appeals.

Supreme Court Justice Luis Roberto Barroso said the decision to bar da Silva was ""very simple"" due to the conviction and later appeals court ruling.

He said the Workers' Party should replace da Silva in up to 10 days and said he should not appear as a presidential candidate in free airtime that is given to political parties on nationwide TV and radio starting on Saturday

Da Silva's lawyers complained the court was rushing a decision because they submitted their defense only on Thursday and noted that the court rarely holds sessions on Fridays.

If da Silva is barred, former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad is seen as his likely candidate for the presidency.

Currently Haddad is candidate for vice president. Polls say the support for his bid as replacement is minimal so far, but da Silva's resilient popularity could boost the former mayor's hopes.",world
"President Trump slammed John Kerry on Monday, labeling the former Massachusetts senator and secretary of state the “father” of the Iran nuclear deal amid speculation that Kerry could challenge Trump in the 2020 election.

“I see that John Kerry, the father of the now terminated Iran deal, is thinking of running for President,” Trump tweeted. “I should only be so lucky - although the field that is currently assembling looks really good - FOR ME!”

The tweet from the president came amid speculation that Kerry, the Democratic nominee who ran unsuccessfully against President George W. Bush in 2004, is considering another run in two years.

Kerry, 74, has refused to rule out another run for the White House in 2020, but has urged Democrats to focus on the midterm races.

""Talking about 2020 right now is a total distraction and waste of time,"" Kerry said in an interview with CBS News' ""Face the Nation.""

""What we need to do is focus on 2018. We need to win back the confidence of the country to move in a better direction, and to do it in sensible ways,"" he said.

Kerry said that for now he will “continue to be an activist.”

He added, “I’m going to continue to fight.”

In January, the Israeli newspaper Maariv reported that Kerry, during a visit to the Middle East, told Palestinian officials he was considering running for president in 2020.

Trump has been critical not only of the Iran deal but also of Kerry’s role in negotiating the now-defunct agreement. The president repeatedly has called Kerry the “worst negotiator I’ve ever seen.”

Kerry also criticized former President Barack Obama in his CBS interview, arguing that Obama should have followed through on his infamous “red line” warning to Syria, and that the United States “paid a price” as a result of Obama's inaction.

"Puerto Rico's governor on Tuesday raised the official death toll from Hurricane Maria from 64 to 2,975, in response to a new study that found the initial numbers reported were undercounted.

The study, an independent investigation ordered by the local government, found that nearly 3,000 people died in the hurricane, which hit the island in September 2017.

Gov. Ricardo Rossello responded to the study by the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University by officially raising the toll.

The number is more than double the government's previous estimated death toll of 1,400.

""We never anticipated a scenario of zero communication, zero energy, zero highway access,"" Rossello said. ""I think the lesson is to anticipate the worst.""

A previous study led by a team of Harvard scientists found that more than 4,600 people were killed in the devastation, dismissing the initial toll of 64 as a ""substantial underestimate.""

BBC REPORTER COVERING HAWAII HURRICANE HIT BY FALLING TREE DURING LIVE REPORT: 'THAT WAS UNEXPECTED'

Rossello said he's forming a commission to study the response to the storm. He said a registry of vulnerable people will also be created prior to any future hurricanes.

There's no national standard for how to calculate disaster-related deaths. While the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports only direct deaths, such as those caused by flying debris or drowning, some local governments may include indirect deaths from things as heart attacks and house fires.

Researchers with George Washington said they counted deaths over the span of six months — a much longer period than usual — because so many people were without power during that time.

The number of dead has political implications for the Trump administration, which was accused of responding half-heartedly to the disaster. Shortly after the storm, when the official death toll stood at 16, President Trump marveled over the small loss of life compared to that of ""a real catastrophe like Katrina.""

HURRICANE LANE CREATED A STEAMY WHITE-OUT AT HAWAII'S KILAUEU VOLCANO

Hurricane Katrina, which struck New Orleans in 2005, was directly responsible for about 1,200 deaths, according to the NHC. That does not include indirect deaths of the sort the George Washington researchers counted in Puerto Rico.

In response to the death roll rise, the White House said Tuesday that ""the federal government has been, and will continue to be, supportive of Governor Rosselló’s efforts to ensure a full accountability and transparency of fatalities resulting from last year’s hurricanes – the American people, including those grieving the loss of a loved one, deserve no less.""

The administration said they're ""focused on Puerto Rico's recovery and preparedness for the current Hurricane season.""

"President Donald Trump said Friday he has directed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to delay a planned trip to North Korea, citing insufficient progress on denuclearization.

Trump put some blame on Beijing, saying he does not believe China is helping ""because of our much tougher Trading stance.""

The surprise announcement appeared to mark a concession by the president to domestic and international concerns that his prior claims of world-altering progress on the peninsula had been strikingly premature.

""I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea, at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" Trump tweeted Friday, barely two months after his June meeting with the North's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.

Trump's comment followed a report issued Monday by the International Atomic Energy Agency outlining ""grave concern"" about the North's nuclear program. It came a day after Pompeo appointed Stephen Biegun, a senior executive with the Ford Motor Co., to be his special envoy for North Korea and said he and Biegun would visit next week.

The State Department never confirmed details of the trip, but it had been expected that Pompeo would be in Pyongyang for at least several hours Monday, according to several diplomatic sources familiar with the plan.

White House officials declined to specify what prompted Trump to call off Pompeo's trip or what had changed since the president's rose-colored-glasses assessments of the nuclear situation just days ago.

A senior White House official said Trump made the decision to cancel the visit Friday morning during a meeting with Pompeo, Biegun, chief of staff John Kelly and National Security Adviser John Bolton, who joined by phone. Intelligence and defense officials were not in the meeting, the official said, seeming to indicate that the breakdown was diplomatic in nature. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.

South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa has talked with Pompeo over Trump's decision to delay Pompeo's planned visit to North Korea because of what he saw as insufficient progress on denuclearization.

Seoul's Foreign Ministry said late Friday that Pompeo during the telephone conversation explained the background of the decision to Kang. The ministry says Kang and Pompeo agreed that Washington and Seoul will work to keep the momentum of dialogue alive while pursuing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and stabilizing peace.

The State Department had no immediate comment on the administration decision and referred questions to the White House.

Trump laid unspecified blame on China, North Korea's leading trade partner, which is widely believed to hold the greatest sway over Kim's government.

The U.S. and China have been locked in a trade dispute for months, with each side ratcheting up tariffs on imports from the other country in what may be the opening salvos of a trade war.

Trump tweeted that ""Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future, most likely after our Trading relationship with China is resolved."" He added: ""In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim. I look forward to seeing him soon!""

After more a year of escalating tensions defined by nuclear and missile tests, new sanctions and ""fire and fury"" rhetoric, Trump made history meeting Kim earlier this year. In the run-up to the summit both nations engaged in hard-nosed negotiation, with Trump publically calling off the meeting in an effort to push Kim to agree to nuclear concessions. During the summit, the pair signed a vague joint statement in which the North agreed to denuclearize, but which left nearly all details undefined.

""There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea,"" Trump declared on Twitter after the meeting.

""Before taking office people were assuming that we were going to War with North Korea. President Obama said that North Korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem,"" he added. ""No longer - sleep well tonight!""

Pompeo would have been hard pressed to return from Pyongyang with anything resembling progress on the denuclearization front.

Although it has halted nuclear and missile testing and taken some unrelated steps — dismantling portions of a missile engine facility and returning the suspected remains of American servicemen killed during the Korean War — its nuclear weapons program and ballistic missile development remain intact, according the U.N.'s atomic watchdog and intelligence agencies.

In addition, recent statements from North Korean officials have ruled out any new concessions until it sees a reciprocal gesture from the U.S. beyond suspending military exercises with South Korea. North Korea has been demanding that the U.S. ease or lift crippling sanctions — something Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton have flatly ruled out until the its nuclear program is fully and verifiably dismantled.

Other than sanctions relief, the North, backed by South Korea, has been seeking a declaration of the end of the Korean War. The conflict stopped with the signing of an armistice rather than a peace treaty, meaning the war is not technically over. Both the North and South have vowed to end the open state of hostilities, and Seoul had been hoping to persuade the Trump administration to sign off on a non-binding end-of-war declaration as a goodwill gesture that would give Kim Jong Un domestic cover to proceed with denuclearization moves.

Pompeo and other administration officials have suggested some concessions short of easing or lifting sanctions are possible before verified denuclearization, but have refused to be specific about what they could be. And they have been skeptical about an end-of-war declaration in the absence of any progress on the nuclear matter.

At the same time, lawmakers from both parties, including GOP hawks who generally support Trump, have expressed concerns about such a move, as it could be used by the North to demand the removal of U.S. troops from South Korea and potentially Japan without anything in return.

Trump had kept up the positive tone as recently as Tuesday at a campaign rally in West Virginia. There Trump maintained ""we're doing well with North Korea.""

""There's been no missile launches. There's been no rocket launches,"" he added.

At the same rally, Trump seemed to take a different tone too on China, saying he had withheld some criticism of China because ""I wanted them to help us with North Korea and they have.""

"President Trump kept the diplomacy door open with North Korea on Friday, welcoming the regime's latest “productive” statement and saying the two sides are still talking following the administration’s decision to cancel a planned summit with Kim Jong Un.

In a tweet on Friday night, the president said talks about reinstating a June summit that was canceled earlier this week were progressing: ""We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date.""

Trump had nixed the summit following threats from North Korea. But hours after the U.S. pulled out of the meeting, North Korea issued a statement suggesting the regime was open to talks.

“Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time (and talent) will tell!” Trump tweeted on Friday morning.

He also told reporters that “we’re talking to them now,” adding, “It could even be the 12th.”

“They very much want to do it, we want to do it, we’ll see what happens,” Trump said. “Everybody plays games.”

A top North Korean official had issued a statement Thursday evening expressing the regime’s “willingness” to sit down for a summit with the U.S.

“We express our willingness to sit down face-to-face with the U.S. and resolve issues anytime and in any format,” North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan said, according to Yonhap News outlet, which cited the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA.)

The official also said that Trump’s move to call off the summit highlighted the tensions between the two countries, further emphasizing the need for a meeting. The official added that Kim had been preparing for the summit.

“Despite all of this, the U.S.’ unilateral decision to scrap the talks causes us to reconsider whether all of the efforts and the path we have taken is really the right one or not,” the official said, according to Yonhap. “Our commitment to doing our best for the sake of peace and stability for the world and the Korean Peninsula remains unchanged, and we are open-minded in giving time and opportunity to the U.S.”

But on Friday, with the door left open for potential U.S.-North Korea talks, Trump suggested it was the Democrats who were against “negotiations” with the rogue regime.

“Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea. Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals & must be nurtured, or asking to end your big Tax Cuts & raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch!” Trump tweeted Friday.

Following Trump’s letter to Kim on Thursday suggesting to hold the meeting would have been “inappropriate,” House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., blasted the president, suggesting Kim had “won.”

Pelosi described the letter from Trump to Kim as a “Valentine.”

“He’s the big winner and when he got this letter from the president saying ‘okay nevermind,’ he must be having a giggle fit, right now, in North Korea,” Pelosi said on Capitol Hill Thursday.

Also on Friday, the president tweeted about the reported FBI informant who had communicated with members of his campaign in 2016.

“The Democrats are now alluding to the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an ‘informant’ who is paid a fortune and who ‘sets up’ way earlier than the Russia Hoax?” Trump tweeted.

Moments later he added: “Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST!”

After a high-level Justice Department briefing held Thursday on the Russia case, Democratic lawmakers maintained there was no evidence to support claims of a spy in the Trump campaign.

"Florida students returning to classes this week will see the state’s motto, “In God We Trust,” etched on plaques on campus.

A new statute, part of a sweeping education bill signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott in March, specifically states each school district is required to display the state motto “in all of the schools in the district and in each building used by the district school board.”

The motto must be display conspicuously on school grounds.

The measure was sponsored by Rep. Kimberly Daniels, D-Jacksonville, who runs a Christian ministry. She told the Orlando Sentinel in March the motto is “something so great [that] should not be hidden.”

“This motto is inscribed on the halls of this great capitol and inked on our currency, and it should be displayed so that our children will be exposed and educated on this great motto, which is part of this country’s foundation,” she said when a House committee took up her bill.

“In God We Trust” has been part of Florida’s state seal since 1868 and on the state flag since 1990. However, it has only been the state motto since 2006, according to the Florida Department of State.

The motto is a slight variation of Florida’s first motto, “In God is our Trust.”

In Alabama, legislation approved by state lawmakers in February that would also require schools to display the same motto is facing backlash from critics who call it “a constant push for theocracy.” The legislation is not a mandate.

Tennessee lawmakers approved legislation earlier this spring that requires the motto’s prominent display inside all public schools.

"The Federal Communications Commission may have killed off the controversial Fairness Doctrine this week, but conservatives -- offering faint praise for the move -- are sounding the alarm over what they see as backdoor attempts by the Obama administration to regulate political speech on the airwaves.

They point to ownership diversity and ""localism"" as other ways Democrats can try to keep the spirit of the Fairness Doctrine alive and silence conservatives and Christian broadcasters.

“The path to censor radio airwaves is being paved through the back door,” Media Research Center President Brent Bozell said.

But some analysts say these fears are overblown because none of the other proposals rise to the level of censorship.

“They are impediments to the open market of ideas,” said Michael Tanner, senior fellow at the Cato Institute. “But they’re not the same as direct censorship as the Fairness Doctrine itself.”

The Fairness Doctrine was adopted in 1949 and required licensed broadcasters to share airwaves equally for competing political points of view. At the time of its creation, only 2,881 radio stations existed, compared with roughly 14,000 today.

The doctrine was revoked in 1987, but many conservatives feared that it would be resurrected as a way to break its dominance in talk radio.

But on Monday, the FCC put the final nail in the coffin by striking it from its books as part a larger mandate proposed by the Obama administration to ease regulatory burdens by getting rid of duplicative or outdated measures.

“The FCC deserves a one-handed round of applause for this move,” Bozell said.

“Years ago, striking the Censorship Doctrine – and that’s exactly what the Fairness Doctrine was – would have actually meant something,” he said. “But since the FCC started playing with policies of ‘localism,’ ‘media diversity’ and a nebulous requirement to ‘serve the public interest,’ with yet another unelected and unconfirmed ‘Diversity Czar’ to implement these proposed regulations, the spirit of the Censorship Doctrine has remained very much alive.

The National Religious Broadcasters Association also expressed caution about the end of the Fairness Doctrine.

“On this day of genuine celebration, NRB will remain vigilant regarding the concepts embodied in the Fairness Doctrine,” said Frank Wright, the association’s president and chief executive. “While the letter of the law is now dead, we want to ensure that the spirit of this particular law also remains dead. There are many voices calling for increased scrutiny of broadcast programming under the guise of ‘localism,’ and we see such proposals as a Fairness Doctrine in different garb.”

Although localism, diversity and competition have been part of the FCC’s mission from the beginning, the agency has launched new initiatives in recent years to meet those goals in a rapidly changing era of mergers and advanced technology.

FCC Commissioner Michael Copps urged his colleagues to ""breathe new life"" into that mission this week.

""I'm not sure we had to kill the Fairness Doctrine twice; it was already a dead letter,"" he said in a statement.

""Frankly, I think we should focus on tackling the very live challenges that face broadcast news in the 21st century: where have all the journalists gone and why?"" he said. ""Whatever happened to the kind of fact-filled investigative journalist that held the powerful accountable? Why do so many important stories go untold?

""Part of the shortfall has been an FCC that has been asleep at the switch for the better part of 30 years in meeting its statutory public interest oversight responsibilities,"" he added.""

One of the recent proposals that emerged from localism proceedings that began in the past decade is requiring local media outlets across the country to establish community advisory boards to monitor what those local stations air and advise them what programming could cover “issues of importance” to the community.

But in June, a staff report recommended terminating the localism proceeding.

The agency is also weighing recommendations from its diversity committee on how to increase the number of women and minority radio broadcast owners, which is only 3.9 percent, an FCC official told FoxNews.com.

The committee has recommended allowing companies to exceed the number of stations they can acquire in any given market if they establish an “incubator program to promote ownership by disadvantaged businesses.”

But conservatives have targeted the FCC’s diversity officer, Mark Lloyd, who they believe is focused on limiting their voice.

Lloyd authored an essay in 2007 entitled “The Structural Imbalance of Political Talk Radio,” and a followup called “Forget the Fairness Doctrine,” in which he argued that the rise and influence of Rush Limbaugh and other conservative radio hosts were traced to “relaxed ownership rules” and other pro-business regulation that destroyed localism.

But Tanner noted that Lloyd has “not done anything” since Obama appointed him to the office two years ago.

Tanner said while localism can be impediment, it doesn’t have a direct impact on content.

“That said, it’s possible that could be abused to not to be content-neutral,” he said. “But that’s an abuse of the statue, not the statue itself, which is content-neutral.”",politics
"Exuberant Democrats – carried along by the self-righteousness of their authoritarian and puritanical identity politics zealotry, and self-confidence in the supposedly inevitable electoral annihilation of President Trump and Republicans in November – are starting to see a long-cherished liberal dream as an imminent reality: California as a model for the whole nation.

You’ll get the picture if you read a widely-shared article published earlier this year by Medium, written by tech guru Peter Leyden, headlined “The Great Lesson of California in America’s New Civil War.” The article is subtitled: “Why there’s no bipartisan way forward at this juncture in our history – one side must win.”

The article describes California as “the harbinger of America’s political future ... a model for America as a whole.”

The fact that Democrats in California now have complete control of all statewide political offices, the state Legislature and local government in cities like San Francisco is touted as great news for “working people.”

The author celebrates the fact that political debates in California involve choices between different degrees of left, with other voices excluded – even though independents and Republicans still comprise a majority of voters in the state, according to the latest party identification data.

The vision of a Californiaized United States is captured in all its glory in the concluding paragraph of the article: “America can’t afford more political paralysis. One side or the other must win. This is a civil war than can be won without firing a shot. But it is a fundamental conflict between two worldviews that must be resolved in short order. California, as usual, resolved it early. The Democrats won; the Republicans lost. The conservative way forward lost; the progressive way forward began. ... California is the future, always about 15 years ahead of the rest of the country. That means that America, starting in 2018, is going to resolve it too.”

Lest you think these are just the random ramblings of a Silicon Valley bubble-dweller, let me point out that the article was not just widely shared but publicly endorsed by such luminaries as the founder and CEO of Twitter. And I can testify from personal experience that this is exactly what members of the California liberal elite actually think. It’s just that few of them say so publicly.

So we’d better take this seriously. Democrats, as the old political adage goes, now want to do to America what they’ve done to California. It’s an alarming prospect.

It’s true that California is the world’s fifth-largest economy; possesses (in my view) unparalleled natural beauty and cultural diversity; and has a spirit of openness and adventure – not to mention great weather – that makes it the best place in the world. I’m a proud California resident and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.

But increasingly, it seems that many of the Golden State’s extraordinary advantages are being recklessly undermined by a governor who likes to think of himself as a beacon of rectitude – but who has a record of bumbling incompetence, special interest corruption and ideological extremism that places him firmly on the Loony Left.

Let’s start with the incompetence. It’s surely quite an accomplishment for Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown to have presided simultaneously over a massive splurge in public spending and a reduction in public services. Health spending has ballooned, but actual health outcomes have not improved. Meanwhile, California is on the brink of a fiscal crisis.

So where has all the money gone? That’s where the special interest corruption comes in. Brown has repeatedly used public money to reward his – and his party’s – paymasters in the public sector unions.

The generous pensions of public employees remain essentially unreformed – that’s the main cause of the looming fiscal crisis. And while workers in the private sector suffer wage stagnation, Brown has thrown pay raise after pay raise at powerful unions like the prison officers.

In interviews, Brown poses as a responsible grownup holding back the tide of mayhem that his more liberal successors will inevitably unleash. But Brown is ending his California career much as he started it: on the fringes, ideologically extreme and the modern-day symbol of the Loony Left. You see it in his extraordinary position on immigration, pandering to the Democrats’ extremist open borders base with his utterly irresponsible “sanctuary state” preening.

And you see it in Brown’s bizarre championing of Proposition 47, which essentially decriminalized the theft of any item under $950. His stance has been a social policy disaster, giving a green light to drug-fueled crime throughout the state.

Above all, Brown will be remembered for his colossal failures on the economy and poverty. California has the highest poverty rate in the nation, the highest level of inequality – and at the same time, the highest taxes.

The cost of living, particularly housing and transportation, is accelerating out of control for working people. It’s no surprise that the number of people moving out of the state has more than doubled in the last three years, with little compensating inward migration. Per capita, California is 46th out of 50 states in attracting newcomers from other parts of the country.

But the most shameful and vivid symbols of Jerry Brown’s failure must surely be the staggering, Third World-style homeless encampments on the streets of California’s big cities.

According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the homeless population in California rose by 14 percent from 2016 to 2017 to 134,000. In Los Angeles the increase was even worse – 26 percent in one year. In sharp contrast, the national homeless population increased by only 1 percent in 2017, to about 553,000, driven primarily by the increase in California homelessness.

What a grotesque epitaph for this self-styled champion of the people. The truth is that Brown’s rule has been great for the rich; grim for the rest.

Now it’s rumored that Brown, who will shortly complete his fourth term as California’s chief executive, is eyeing a national future. He has run unsuccessfully for president three times: in 1976, 1980 and 1992. Party insiders are convinced he wants a fourth go at that too. Given his track record as governor, that’s a frightening prospect for America.

Hubristic Democrats may survey their blue enclaves in the Golden State and dream of exporting their Loony Left revolution to the rest of the country. But any serious look at what life is actually like for working people in California should bring that fantasy crashing to the ground.

We’ll be debating all this on Sunday at 9 p.m. EDT on “The Next Revolution” on Fox News Channel – hope you can join us!",politics
"The leader of an ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan, who was responsible for a spate of recent bombings that left hundreds of civilians dead, was killed in an American drone strike, U.S. officials told Fox News on Sunday.

The deputy spokesperson for Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani announced the death of ISIS-K leader, Abu Sayeed Orakzai, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan spokesman Lt. Col. Martin O’Donnell said.

“I would also add that the United States unrelentingly continues its counterterrorism efforts against ISIS-K, Al-Qaeda, and other regional and international terrorist groups,” O'Donnell said in a statement.

The airstrikes were launched in the Nangarhar province, near the border with Pakistan, according to Agence France-Presse. Ten other ISIS fighters were also killed.

Orakzai is at least the 3rd ISIS-K leader in Afghanistan killed in the past 2 years. The Islamic State has lost around 90 percent of the lands bordering Iraq and Syria since declaring a caliphate in June 2014.

VOICE RECORDING OF ISIS LEADER AL-BAGHDADI PURPORTEDLY EMERGES NEARLY YEAR AFTER THOUGHT KILLED IN STRIKE

The killing of Orakzai comes just takes after an audio recording of the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi apparently resurfaced, in which he congratulated his followers on the occasion of Eid al-Adha, an Islamic holiday, and referenced Turkey’s recent quarrel with the U.S. over its detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson.

He purportedly said “America is going through the worse time in its entire existence,” and said Russia was competing with the U.S. over regional influence and clout.

Al-Baghdadi’s whereabouts has eluded captors since the rise of the Islamic State. His only public appearance was in 2014 in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. His last know audio recording was released on Sept. 28, 2017, and there have been several reports is his death or injury.

Next weekend, a new U.S. military commander will be taking over in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. Scott Miller, the former head of Joint Special Operations Command which oversees the elite commando units Delta Force, SEAL Team 6 and the 75th Ranger Regiment.

The U.S. military has doubled its air strikes in Afghanistan over the past year and increased them fivefold over 2016 levels.

The leader of Syria's al-Qaida affiliate has vowed to fight on in Idlib province, the country's last major rebel stronghold, in the face of a possible government offensive there.

The rare public statement by Abu Mohammed al-Golani came as Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces have been sending reinforcements into areas around Idlib in the country's northwest, along the border with Turkey.

The United States, Britain and France have expressed concern at reports of the Syrian military targeting civilians, schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure in Idlib and underlined ""concern at the potential for further — and illegal — use of chemical weapons"" to bring the province under government control.

Earlier this year, Syrian government forces captured rebel-held suburbs of the capital, Damascus, as well as the southern provinces of Daraa, Quneitra and Sweida.

In parts of these regions, rebels accepted to reconcile with the government, handing over their heavy weapons in return for amnesty — or agreed to be bussed out together with their families and other civilians to rebel-held areas in Idlib.

But taking Idlib would be a much more difficult challenge for Assad's forces as the province is also the base of al-Golani's militant and heavily armed Levant Liberation Committee as the al-Qaida branch in Syria is known.

In his comments, which came in a video released late on Tuesday, al-Golani said state-sponsored surrenders of rebel groups, similar to those that recently occurred elsewhere in Syria, won't happen in Idlib as such actions would be considered ""treason"" by his al-Qaida-linked fighters.

Earlier this month, the Syrian government dropped leaflets over Idlib, urging residents to reconcile with its authority. Officials have warned government forces would take back the province by force if necessary.

According to U.N. estimates, 2.9 million people live in Idlib and surrounding opposition-held areas. The U.N. has appealed to Turkey to open its border to refugees, should the Syrian government decide to attack the province.

Turkey, which has established itself as a sponsor of rebels in northern Syria, already hosts some 3.5 million Syrian refugees - the most of any nation. It has also established 12 monitoring posts in Idlib and deployed 1,000 troops in the province.

In the video, released on the occasion of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, al-Golani is seen wearing an olive-green military uniform and saying that ""Turkish monitoring towers"" cannot be relied on to take on Assad's forces.

""Our weapons are the source of our strength and honor,"" al-Golani says. ""Thinking about surrendering to the enemy and handing over weapons will be considered treason.""

Meanwhile, another militant figure from the al-Qaida-linked group, Abu Yaqzan al-Masri, was unharmed when a gunman opened fire at him and missed on Tuesday. The shooter was detained, according to Mazan al-Shami, an opposition activist based in northwestern Syria.

Dozens of members of the group have been killed over the past few months in attacks blamed on its main jihadi rival, the Islamic State group.",world
"Environmental red tape is causing “long delays” for border agents as they try to fill tunnels used to smuggle people and dangerous drugs into the U.S. from Mexico, according to border officials and Republican lawmakers who have discussed the problem with agents.

Frustrated agents complain the lengthy federal review process can stall critical tunnel-plugging efforts for months after passageways are first discovered.

The tunnels are being used to move people, illegal drugs and even fake pharmaceuticals. But regulations stemming from laws like the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act are putting ""remediation"" on hold.

“I heard firsthand accounts from our Border Patrol agents that environmental red tape is hindering their ability to secure the border,” Utah Rep. Rob Bishop, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, told Fox News this week.

Bishop, along with Arkansas GOP Rep. Bruce Westerman, traveled to the Arizona border in February to meet with border agents and discuss how environmental laws and regulations are impacting security. Bishop, who has legislation aimed at addressing these issues, said they learned of the ""significant delay in remediating illicit tunnels,"" a process where they are filled with gravel and concrete.

A Customs and Border Protection official confirmed to Fox News they've encountered “long delays” in remediating tunnels, acknowledging environmental regulations make up a “good portion of the delay.”

The official said other delays come with “clearing out a tunnel, mapping out the tunnel underground to know where to remediate from above, getting funding for the remediation and fulfilling a contract to a construction company to carry out the remediation.”

One particularly protracted response revolved around a sophisticated border tunnel -- the length of three football fields -- discovered in the town of Naco, Ariz., in February 2015. Photos show the tunnel complete with wooden supports and a cement shaft with a hydraulic lift.

Fox News learned it took between nine months and a year before it was fully remediated. Agents were told it was because of environmental concerns.

While this played out during the Obama administration, officials say agents are still encountering these kinds of delays under the current administration.

“Border security should never take a backseat to the EPA, when you consider the dangerous drugs that come into this country, such as fentanyl,"" Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, said in an interview. ""That tunnel was assuredly used to bring fentanyl into this country, and other dangerous drugs. They don’t use tunnels like that simply to bring in illegal immigrants. They use those for their high-dollar products, such as illicit drugs.”

The tug-of-war over access to federal land has gone on for decades and flared frequently under the Obama administration. While border agents need to patrol that territory, several other agencies are tasked with protecting that land from human interference. Everything from moving surveillance equipment to improving a road can take months.

While Judd mentioned the EPA, the process actually involves a range of agencies – especially those within the Interior and Agriculture departments. A 2006 agreement with those departments gave border agents access to federal land under certain conditions. When Bishop raised this issue during the prior administration, the Interior Department stressed that the agencies work closely together – and that they have to balance security needs with environmental protection.

But delays in filling tunnels have become a source of frustration.

Judd said agents are frustrated when they have to ""babysit"" a tunnel during an environmental review because it takes up resources that could be used elsewhere.

Tunnels are most common in the San Diego sector, according to the Natural Resources Committee. But even the most seemingly simple tunnels to fix can take several months.

In 2014, according to the committee, San Diego Sector Border Patrol agents discovered a small tunnel that used a rail system to move items under the border into the United States.

The tunnel itself was nearly 4 feet, 6 inches high and 2 feet wide. It ran 2,500 feet in length and ran about 1,000 feet into the United States.

The area contained a small wetland. It took about four months to complete a bird study and fill in the tunnel.

The committee has cited that example as a “best-case scenario,” in comparison with other tunnels, where remediation has taken longer because of various regulations.

Other border tunnels discovered in the San Diego area have made news before. Last August, border agents arrested 30 illegal immigrants, including 23 Chinese nationals, outside a smuggling tunnel. The tunnel was near a border fence line, but was hidden by dry brush and branches. It's unclear whether there were any delays in filling that passageway.

Bishop is now pushing legislation to make the remediation of tunnels on federal lands -- and a range of other CBP activities -- exempt from the requirements of environmental laws, like the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.

Bishop’s proposal, tucked into two border security bills, would specifically limit the power of the Interior and Agriculture departments to hinder border agents on the job. Neither department has responded to a request for comment from Fox News.

“Our border patrol agents need the tools and authority to secure our Southern border, and without streamlining the bureaucracy, that won’t happen,” Bishop said.

"A group of 18 Republican lawmakers have signed their names to a letter formally nominating President Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize -- the latest development in a growing push to award the president the honor for his work toward peace in the Korean Peninsula.



The letter, sent by Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind. to the Norwegian Nobel Committee on Tuesday, and signed by 17 other members, says Trump has worked “tirelessly to apply maximum pressure to North Korea to end its illicit weapons programs and bring peace to the region.”



“His Administration successfully united the international community, including China, to impose one of the most successful international sanctions regimes in history,” the letter says. “The sanctions have decimated the North Korean economy and have been largely credited for bringing North Korea to the negotiating table.”



The letter is signed by 17 other members, including Reps Mark Meadows, R-N.C., Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Diane Black, R-Tenn., and Steve King, R-Iowa.



“Although North Korea has evaded demands from the international community to cease its aggression for decades, President Trump’s peace through strength policies are working and bringing peace to the Korean peninsula,” the letter says. “We can think of no one more deserving of the Committee’s recognition in 2019 than President Trump for his tireless work to bring peace to our world.”



The nomination is for the 2019 prize, as the 2018 award nomination period ended in February. According to the Nobel Prize's website, a nomination is considered valid if submitted by persons in certain categories -- including “members of national assemblies and national governments (cabinet members/ministers) of sovereign states as well as current heads of state."" There are 330 candidates for the 2018 prize, which will be announced in October.



Messer, who is currently locked in a Republican primary battle to challenge incumbent Indiana Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly in this year’s midterm, announced his intention to nominate Trump last week and floated the idea of the prize in March.



“The only reason the North Korean dictator is coming to the table is because President Trump has stared him down and shown him that we have a leader in America who means business and who has changed the dynamic in major ways,” Messer told Fox News. “That’s why I think he has to be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize.”



The move for an award for Trump has picked up steam since the dramatic developments in relation to North Korea, which has seen the leaders of North and South Korea meet in person for a summit where the two discussed denuclearization and declared a formal end to the Korean War. The North Korean regime has also said it will end its nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missile testing program.



In a rally in Michigan at the weekend, Trump touted progress in North Korea and was interrupted by supporters chanting: “No-bel, No-bel, No-bel.”



An award would likely be controversial among many peace activists, who would point to Trump’s fiery language toward North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un -- whom he dubbed “rocket man” and warned was on a “suicide mission for himself” in 2017. But supporters say that Trump’s tactics were part of a “peace through strength” approach of the kind that proved successful for President Ronald Reagan when he faced down the Soviet Union.



""The peace through strength approach to national security is delivering results, not just in North Korea,” Messer said. “ISIS is on the run and I think the world is waking up to the fact that there's a new sheriff in town and the world’s most important leader today is Donald Trump.”



The push for Trump to get the prize was given a big boost when South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Trump should get the prize.

SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT: TRUMP 'SHOULD WIN THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE'



“President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize,” Moon reportedly told a meeting of senior secretaries, according to Reuters. “What we need is only peace.”

Earlier this year, Moon praised Trump’s role in brokering an end to the crisis, noting he “deserves big credit for bringing about the inter-Korean talks,” and said “it could be a resulting work of the U.S.-led sanctions and pressure.”

For many U.S. conservatives, it would also work to rectify the controversial 2009 decision by the committee to award the honor to President Barack Obama at a time when he had only just taken office and had not had a chance to rack up any foreign policy achievements.



The committee chose to award it to Obama for his “extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples” and specifically for his “vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons.”



But the decision was widely criticized, and even Obama in his acceptance speech noted that other past recipients were “far more deserving of this honor than I.” Obama struggled to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula, and Trump said recently that Obama told him during the transition that it would be his “biggest problem” in terms of foreign policy.



“If the Nobel Peace Prize means anything, President Trump should have a great shot at getting it,” Messer said. “After all President Obama received it for little more than running a glamorous campaign for president. Trump has shown major steps toward delivering peace.”



Presidents Jimmy Carter, Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt have also been honored with the award. In 2007, former Vice President Al Gore was given the award alongside the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for their work on climate change.



Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also offered his possible support for a Trump Nobel prize on Sunday, saying on Fox News’ ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that if things work out, Trump deserves the award.

“President Trump, if he can lead us to ending the Korean War after 70 years and getting North Korea to give up their nuclear program in a verifiable way deserves the Nobel Peace Prize and then some,” Graham said.

However, he also recognized just how controversial such an award would be among Trump opponents.



“It may be the first time the Nobel Peace Prize was given and there was mass casualties because I think a lot of liberals would kill themselves if they did that,” he joked.",politics
"The California legislature on Wednesday voted to raise the age for buying long guns throughout the state from 18 to 21.

Senate Bill 1100, introduced by Sen. Anthony Portantino, was approved with a 26-12 vote and sent to Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown for a signature, The Sacramento Bee reported.

The bill would limit those who can purchase rifles to age 21 and above. State law already limits the sale of handguns to people 21 or older.

Portantino cited the February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida — in which a 19-year-old used a AR-15-style gun to kill 17 people — as inspiration for the bill.

""The two most deadly recent school tragedies have been perpetrated by people under 21 with long guns,” Portantino said Wednesday. ""We should be sending our children off to school knowing they are going to be safe, healthy and get a good education.""

Opponents of the legislation argued that people can obtain long guns through illegal channels and that state legislators should focus on making sure criminals and those with mental health issues cannot get guns themselves.

Republican Sen. Jim Nielsen said he thinks ""bills like this miss the target,"" according to the Los Angeles Times.

""What is magic about 21?"" Nielsen asked. ""All of a sudden you are not a danger anymore?

"At least 1,500 people paid respects to Sen. John McCain, who succumbed to an aggressive form of brain cancer on Saturday, as they streamed past his closed, flag-draped casket at the Arizona Capitol.

Well-wishers had been waiting in line in the withering summer heat — the high in Phoenix was 104 degrees — some for hours, to take part in the public viewing on Wednesday.

Families with children paid respects. Men paused beside the casket to salute or bow.

People came from out of state. They also crossed political lines and the full spectrum of ages.

Barry and Linda Vittori separately made the roughly five-hour drive from San Diego on Tuesday night. Linda Vittori said McCain “epitomizes what I think our forefathers were hoping our country would be.”

Vietnamese veterans in their uniforms saluted McCain’s casket, and a mariachi singer strummed his guitar and sang outside as a tribute.

Ray Riordan, an 87-year-old Navy veteran who fought in the Korean War, came from Payson, Arizona.

“I grew up where a handshake was a contract and your word was your bond,” Riordan said. “He represented the last of that, as far as I’m concerned.”

Kassandra Morales, 44, stood in line with her sons, ages 8 and 2. The single mother and Democrat, who came with a bouquet, said she had long looked up to McCain.

“Yesterday I asked my son who his hero was. He gave me a rapper’s name,” Morales said. “I brought my children here to show them what a real hero was.”

JOHN MCCAIN INSPIRED ME AS AN INTERN — AND THEN I COVERED HIM FOR FOX NEWS

The viewing came on what would have been the Republican senator’s 82nd birthday, and followed an emotional private ceremony attended by McCain’s family and colleagues.

During the private service, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey remembered McCain not just as a senator and internationally known figure, but a major figure in the history of their state.

While Barry Goldwater was an Arizona native, McCain was “Arizona’s favorite adopted son,” the governor said of McCain, who was born in the Panama Canal Zone while his father served in the military.

“Imagining an Arizona without John McCain is like picturing Arizona without the Grand Canyon,” Ducey said.

Cindy McCain, the late senator’s wife, pressed her face against the flag-draped casket, and several of his children sobbed during services for the statesman, presidential contender and former prisoner of war.

The private service at the Arizona Capitol marked the first appearance of McCain’s family members since the senator died.

Former Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl said he had been with McCain all around the world. McCain, he said, had better instincts on when to assert U.S. power than anyone else he knew.

Kyl said he would miss McCain, whose greatest contribution was in the realm of national security.

“I will miss him as a friend, and a strong force for America, and the world,” Kyle said.

Sen. Jeff Flake offered the benediction at the service.

His words included the following: “Now as we go forward, let us remember thy humble servant with gladness and cheerfulness to answer his call to summon the better angels of our nature, to see and appreciate the humanity in our opponents, to more freely forgive so that we might be forgiven.”

Thursday morning will feature a procession through Phoenix on the way to a memorial service at North Phoenix Baptist Church, with the public invited to line the route along Interstate 17, according to officials.

The memorial service is set to include a tribute from former Vice President Joe Biden. Musical choices include a recessional accompanied by Frank Sinatra’s “My Way.”

From there, McCain will depart Arizona from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, officials say.

Another viewing is scheduled for the U.S. Capitol on Friday, with a final memorial service at the Washington National Cathedral.

For some Arizona residents, McCain has been a political fixture for their entire lives. He took office in the state in the early 1980s, first as a congressman and then as a senator occupying the seat once held by Goldwater.

The public viewing would go on as long as people are waiting in line, said Rick Davis, McCain’s former presidential campaign manager.

Phil Hubbard, a health care recruiter from Scottsdale, held a cold water bottle in each hand as he waited for a chance to pay his respects.

“He believed in something,” said Hubbard, who had voted for McCain. “That’s what he did, and that’s what a lot of people need to do in this country. If you believe in something, stand up for it, whether it’s popular or not.”

"Seattle’s anti-Trump mayor, Jenny Durkan, may be on track for a political backlash: Her city’s $52 million money splash on public transit appears doomed because new taxpayer-funded streetcars apparently won’t fit the existing tracks.

Durkan’s office has braced city residents for the possibility, the Seattle Times reported.

The Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) reportedly ordered 10 new streetcars last year, to help expand the Seattle Streetcar system by linking the two existing streetcar lines.

But the new streetcars also are reportedly heavier and longer than the ones currently in use, raising concerns about whether they'll be used at all.

“It appears the error will require either a change order for design of the streetcars or incur new costs for construction of new or retrofitted maintenance barns,” City Councilmember Lisa Herbold wrote in the city’s blog post last week.

“It appears the error will require either a change order for design of the streetcars or incur new costs for construction of new or retrofitted maintenance barns.” - Seattle City Councilmember Lisa Herbold

Durkan had to temporarily stop work on the project after revelations that it may cost 50 percent more than previously estimated, the Times reported. The estimated total cost has already increased from $150 million to $200 million.

It's just the latest of several setbacks for Durkan while her national profile continues to rise amid fervent attacks against the Trump administration over immigration, climate change and abortion.

In April, after the U.S. Justice Department sent letters urging so-called sanctuary cities, including Seattle, to prove they are cooperating with federal immigration authorities, Durkan fired back, saying the administration should focus on “real public safety threats.”

“Our city complies with federal immigration law and asks that the Department of Justice and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] do the same,” Durkan said in a statement. “The federal government does not get to run our cities or convert our local law enforcement officials into immigration cops. I implore this administration to focus on real public safety threats, like the opioid crisis, instead of unnecessarily threatening our residents and mayors across the country.”

Durkan doesn’t hold back when attacking the administration on Twitter, either.

“As woman mayors, we are doing our part to protect our citizens against the all-out war that the Trump administration has waged against safe, inclusive communities, clean energy, and bold climate action,” she wrote in a tweet.

“Further evidence that Trump’s administration is founded on cruelty and callous disregard for immigrant lives. Seattle stands with Salvadorans against this unjust decision,” she wrote in another tweet, referring to the Trump administration’s decision to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from El Salvador.

But as the mayor’s profile rises nationally, the city is facing dire problems and embarrassing flip-flops. The Seattle region reportedly has the third-highest number of homeless people in the U.S., even though the city spent $68 million on combatting homelessness last year.

Earlier this year, the city council also had to repeal a “head tax” aimed at taxing businesses that make $20 million in gross revenue about $275 per full-time worker each year.

The money would have gone to alleviate the homelessness problem. The tax was repealed just a month later after it passed due to pressure from Seattle-based companies Amazon and Starbucks.",politics
"Scott Wallace, a liberal millionaire candidate running for Congress in Pennsylvania, has given millions of dollars to so-called population control groups.

Such groups have advocated for taxing parents “to the hilt” for having more than two children, calling it “irresponsible breeding,” and said abortion is “a highly effective weapon” to combat overpopulation.

Wallace, grandson of a former vice president who’s running as a Democrat in Pennsylvania's 1st Congressional District against Republican incumbent Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, has been in charge of the the Wallace Global Fund ""for the last two decades"" that gave out nearly $7 million to population control groups since 1997.

Zero Population Growth (ZPG) was among the organizations that received the money from the fund. According to public records, it received $420,000 between 1997 and 2003.

“No responsible family should have more than two children.” - Zero Population Growth, a group that received funding from Scott Wallace.

The group, shortly after being founded in 1968, released a brochure advocating abortion to stabilize population growth and claimed that “no responsible family should have more than two children.” To deal with larger families, it also called for families to be “taxed to the hilt” for “irresponsible breeding.”

It also blamed the overpopulation on the “white middle-class” that “use up more than their share of resources and do more than their share of polluting” and urged them to “voluntarily limit their families to two children.”

Paul Ehrlich, who co-founded the ZPG, once called abortion “a highly effective weapon in the armory of population control.” The goal of the organization, which changed its name to Population Connection in 2002, has remained the same since its inception, arguing that the world needs to contain population growth with particular emphasis on American families.

The organization’s political arm, Population Connection Action Fund, publicly endorsed Wallace for Congress, saying his support for their cause is “exactly the kind of dedication we need in Congress.”

Wallace’s fund also gave $20,000 in 2010 to the Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy (CASSE), a group that sees the economic growth as undesirable and instead supports an economy with “stable or mildly fluctuating levels” and a society where birth rates equal death rates.

The organization openly supports zero population growth and its executive board member, Herman Daly, advocated issuing reproduction licenses, allowing women to have only two children, unless they buy the license for more children from other women. Daly called it the “best plan yet offered” to limit population growth.

""Former Co-Chair Scott Wallace is proud of the work of grantees like Planned Parenthood in empowering women and protecting reproductive rights and will stand up for Pennsylvania women."" - Scott Wallace's campaign communications director Zoe Wilson-Meyer

Zoe Wilson-Meyer, communications director for Wallace’s campaign, didn’t answer Fox News’ questions on whether Wallace still supports the ideas expressed by the groups.

“The Wallace Global Fund has for decades been a leader in helping women gain access to family planning. Former Co-Chair Scott Wallace is proud of the work of grantees like Planned Parenthood in empowering women and protecting reproductive rights and will stand up for Pennsylvania women,” she said in an email.

“In Washington, Brian Fitzpatrick voted to defund Planned Parenthood and supports Donald Trump’s effort to take away a woman’s right to choose,” she added.

The revelations of the foundation’s donations come as Wallace faces continuing criticism over past funding activities. The foundation reportedly donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to anti-Israel groups that support a boycott of the Jewish State. Local Democratic groups in the state expressed deep concern about the donations, but have since endorsed Wallace after he renounced the donations made in the name of his family’s fund.

TOP DEM HOUSE HOPEFUL FUNDED GITMO DETAINEES’ LEGAL HELP ‘JUST AFTER 9/11’

Fox News previously reported that Wallace was also a key financier of the Center for Constitutional Rights’ efforts to represent alleged terrorists in the Guantanamo Bay just after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

“Just after 9/11 many were afraid of the work the Center was doing,” Vince Warren, executive director of the group, told Wallace’s alma mater’s Haverford Magazine in 2009, adding that funding the center’s work was difficult. “And yet H. Scott Wallace ’73 of the Wallace Global Fund, stepped up and helped.”

The race in Pennsylvania's 1st Congressional District is among the most high-stakes election in the country in the upcoming midterms. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) added Wallace’s candidacy to its “Red to Blue” program aimed at flipping the district.",politics
"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his administration are once again under fire for the city’s ongoing problem with gun violence, as this past weekend left at least 11 people dead and 70 others wounded.

""Our souls are burdened,"" Emanuel said in response. ""It is unacceptable to happen in any neighborhood of Chicago. We are a better city.""

Though the Windy City ended last year with 650 homicides — down from 771 the year before — the total still exceeded the combined number of killings in New York and Los Angeles.

GIULIANI SLAMS CHICAGO GUN VIOLENCE AFTER WEEKEND SHOOTINGS LEAVE AT LEAST 11 DEAD, ROUGHLY 70 WOUNDED

The staggering numbers have resulted in calls for change, as well as from those who would prefer different leadership altogether.

As the city grapples with how to deal with ongoing violence, here’s who has called for the mayor to resign so far.

Chance the Rapper

In addition to announcing he had acquired the Chicagoist, a website that covers Chicago news and culture, Chance the Rapper also called for Emanuel to step down in the song “I Might Need Security,” which was released in July.

""And Rahm you're done, I'm expecting resignation,” Chance, whose given name is Chancelor Bennett, raps in the song.

At a November 2017 city council meeting, the 25-year-old singer also raised concerns about a $95 million new police training academy to instruct police officers in the wake of a federal finding that they used excessive force against black residents.

Chance the Rapper suggested putting the money toward the city’s public schools and mental health programs instead. The mayor reportedly walked out of the meeting not long before the rapper spoke.

Rev. Gregory Livingston

A long-time critic of Emanuel, Rev. Gregory Livingston, a prominent pastor in the Chicago-area, amplified his calls for change after police dashcam footage showed the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald in 2014, Rolling Stone reported. Chicago officer Jason Van Dyke fired 16 shots at the 17-year-old, who was carrying a small knife with its blade folded. The incident made headlines across the country and sparked protests in the city. Van Dyke is still awaiting trial.

CHICAGO SHOOTINGS PUT SPOTLIGHT ON ILLINOIS GUN LAWS

More recently, Livingston spoke out against Emanuel ahead of a large anti-violence march in early August. Speaking at City Hall days before the event, the reverend said he and other demonstrators did not need the mayor’s support or approval, as they were calling for Emanuel and Eddie Johnson, the superintendent for the Chicago Police Department, to step down.

“The call of the people is ‘Resign Rahm,’” Livingston said, according to The Chicago Tribune. “So how, then, can you back your own regime change? How do you sanction your own termination? How dumb, naive and self-hating do you think we are?”

Chicago protesters

Some 200 protesters in the city marched through some of Chicago’s affluent neighborhoods days before the killings with the goal to bring attention to gun violence — as well as corruption and the lack of economic investment — in the city's poorer areas and African-American neighborhoods.

The demonstrators, who briefly shut down Chicago's Lake Shore Drive on Aug. 2, also demanded the resignation of Johnson and Emanuel for failure to stem gun violence.

CHICAGO ACTIVISTS DEMAND RAHM EMANUEL RESIGN AHEAD OF ANTI-VIOLENCE RALLY

""There are too many killings in Chicago, there are too many police-involved killings in Chicago,"" Tio Hardiman, one of the demonstration's organizers, told The Associated Press. ""It's time to change the narrative in Chicago.""

The confirmation hearings for President Trump's Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh are set to begin Tuesday, and a bitter, highly partisan war over a potential rightward shift in the high court is expected

Parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama are on alert as Tropical Storm Gordon pummeled South Florida Monday and could strengthen into a hurricane when it hits the Gulf Coast on Tuesday

President Trump accused Attorney General Jeff Sessions of jeopardizing Republicans' chances in the November midterms because of Justice Department investigations against two Republican congressmen

NBC News chairman Andy Lack defended his network's handling of Ronan Farrow's exposé of the sexual misconduct allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein in a memo to employees Monday

Nike is under fire for selecting controversial former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick as one of the faces of the 30th anniversary of its 'Just Do It' campaign.

Voters in Massachusetts will go to the polls Tuesday to decide candidates in gubernatorial, congressional and Senate races



THE LEAD STORY - THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION BATTLE: The Senate Judiciary Committee launches confirmation hearings for President Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday, kicking off what is expected to be a bitterly partisan gauntlet as Democrats vow to scrutinize his lengthy record as an appellate judge and lawyer in the Bush administration ... Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch and leading Democrats to ratchet up their rhetoric.

However, Kavanaugh steadily has gathered support from legal circles, former colleagues and Republican lawmakers. The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee. Republicans command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, which would return to 51-49 once a Republican successor to the late Sen. John McCain is appointed. Republicans have little margin for error, though Vice President Pence can break a tie.

THE GULF COAST BRACES FOR GORDON: Parts of the Gulf Coast are under a hurricane warning after Tropical Storm Gordon drenched parts of South Florida and meteorologists warned it could strengthen into hurricane by late Tuesday ... Meteorologists have warned Gordon likely will strengthen into a hurricane by the time it reaches coastal Mississippi and Louisiana. The hurricane warning was placed into effect for the area stretching from the mouth of the Pearl River in Mississippi to the Alabama-Florida border. Voluntary evacuation orders were issued on Monday for parts of Louisiana for residents in areas outside the levee protection system.

Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Monday and said 200 National Guard troops will be deployed to southeastern Louisiana. After making landfall, Gordon is expected to charge inland over the lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday.

TRUMP DUMPS ON SESSIONS ... AGAIN: President Trump lashed out at Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a string of tweets on Monday, accusing him of hurting Republican chances in the upcoming midterm elections with a series of Justice Department investigations ... “Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department,” Trump tweeted. “Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff.....”

The president apparently was referring to the current investigations into GOP Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York. FOX News has reached out to the White House for additional clarification, and the Justice Department did not immediately respond. Monday’s tweets continued a long-running gripe Trump has had with Sessions ever since the attorney general recused himself last year from the Russia investigation.

NBC NEWS CHIEF ON THE DEFENSIVE ON FARROW, WEINSTEIN: NBC News chairman Andy Lack defended his network’s handling of Ronan Farrow’s Harvey Weinstein reporting in a lengthy memo to staff on Labor Day ... The 10-page memo provided to FOX News, which came with a cover letter and table of contents, was sent out after a former NBC News producer who was working with Farrow on the Weinstein probe said they were ordered to kill the report on direction from ""the very highest levels at NBC.""

But Lack fought back against the allegation in his memo, labeling talk about the network’s handling of the report ""an unusual situation for a news division."" He said there were no ulterior motives to punting the story and that it simply was ""not ready to air.""

DID NIKE 'JUST DO' THEMSELVES IN WITH KAEPERNICK? - Nike selected the controversial former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick as a new face of the athletic wear company’s “Just Do It” campaign, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary ... “Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. #JustDoIt,” Kaepernick posted on Twitter on Monday afternoon. Kaepernick, who hasn’t played on an NFL team since the 2016 season, already had a deal with Nike that was set to expire. However, it was renegotiated into a multi-year deal to make him one of the faces of Nike's 30th anniversary ""Just Do It"" campaign, according to a person familiar with the contract.

The source said Nike will feature Kaepernick on several platforms, including billboards, television commercials and online ads. Nike also will create an apparel line for Kaepernick and contribute to his Know Your Rights charity. The deal puts Kaepernick in the top bracket of NFL players with Nike.

The free agent quarterback stirred up controversy when he began kneeling during the playing of the national anthem prior to NFL games, beginning in the summer of 2016, to protest racial injustices against the African-American community. Many other players have joined the movement since it began, which sparking condemnation from President Trump and a decline in TV ratings for the NFL.

PRIMARY DAY IN BLUEST OF BLUE MASSACHUSETTS: Voters in Massachusetts are choosing between incumbents and fresh faces in Tuesday's primary, where several members of the state's all-Democratic U.S. House delegation face challenges and races for governor and a Republican contest for the U.S. Senate are featured ... The most closely watched contest pits longtime incumbent U.S. Rep. Michael Capuano against Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley. The challenge from Pressley, the first black woman to serve on the city council, has drawn some comparisons to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who upset 10-term New York Rep. Joe Crowley in a Democratic primary in June. If elected, she'd be the first black woman Massachusetts has sent to Congress.

Another veteran congressman, Rep. Richard Neal, also faces a primary challenge from Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, a black attorney from Springfield who, if elected, would be the first Muslim to serve in Congress from Massachusetts. Three other Democratic incumbents — Reps. Stephen Lynch, William Keating and Joe Kennedy — also face primary opponents Tuesday. Another Democrat, U.S. Rep. Niki Tsongas, is retiring at the end of this term and the open seat has touched off a political scramble with 10 candidates on the Democratic primary ballot.

Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, a moderate who has been popular with voters, faces a primary challenge from Scott Lively, a conservative minister from Springfield. Lively, who has little money or staff, calls Baker a ""RINO"" (Republican in Name Only) and declares he is ""100 percent"" behind President Donald Trump. Baker says he did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election and has frequently criticized White House policies.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is unopposed in the Democratic primary, but three Republicans are competing for the nod to face her in November: state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign; John Kingston, a businessman who once tried to fund a third-party challenge to Trump but has become more supportive of the president; and Beth Lindstrom, who served in former Republican Gov. Mitt Romney's administration.

"President Trump's announcement that he would sit down with Kim Jong Un came as a global shock. His cancellation of the meeting, not so much.

You didn't have to be a master diplomat to discern that things were rapidly going downhill between the two countries. North Korea may well have backed him into a corner. And a president who places a premium on projecting strength was not going to stand for that.

Amid indications that Kim might back out of the June 12 summit in Singapore, Trump decided to strike first.

While experts analyze the verbal sniping that led up to the cancellation, I think that misses the larger point. When two world leaders want to meet, they ignore divisive rhetoric and sit down together. That was certainly the case with all those Soviet summits from Nikita Khrushchev to Mikhail Gorbachev.

Still, the atmosphere turned chilly from the moment that Kim objected to the U.S.-South Korea military exercises, which he'd previously said were fine. Then came North Korean objections to televised comments by John Bolton when the national security adviser said the administration would follow the Libya model for denuclearization—not exactly appealing words to the North Koreans, since Muammar Qaddafi wound up dead.

After Vice President Pence told Fox's Martha MacCallum that ""this will only end like the Libya model ended if Kim Jong Un doesn't make a deal,"" the North’s foreign vice minister called Pence a ""political dummy"" and said it was up to the White House ""whether the U.S. will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown.""

That may have been the last straw for Trump, who said earlier this week there was a ""substantial chance"" that the summit would not come off. Yesterday he pulled the plug. No matter that North Korea had just destroyed its nuclear test site, though some experts believe it had been damaged beyond repair.

Donald Trump often walks away from the table, or threatens to, as he did as a New York businessman. He has spoken of pulling out of NAFTA several times. He vowed to pull out of the Iranian nuclear deal before finally doing so.

This is, to him, a negotiating style, all part of what he once called the art of the deal. He is, after all, the man who repeatedly denounced Kim as Little Rocket Man and threatened to destroy his country if necessary before becoming his negotiating partner.

Indeed, Trump’s letter to Kim contained some conciliatory notes: ""Someday, I look very much forward to meeting you ... If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write.""

That is called leaving the door open.

Some skeptics believed that Trump was giving Kim the world stature conferred by such a meeting without getting anything in return. Others said the U.S. wasn't ready for a nuclear summit, that enough groundwork hadn't been laid for successful talks. In this view, Trump was more interested in the optics of a splashy summit, and a potential Nobel Prize, than in doing the arduous work of negotiating a verifiable disarmament in exchange for the elimination of economic sanctions.

If that's true, the cancellation might buy more time for a successful summit down the road—if such a meeting ever materializes.",politics
"Fired FBI agent Peter Strzok took his anti-Trump rhetoric public on Monday, setting up a defiant Twitter account as a GoFundMe page sought to raise $150,000 to cover his ""legal costs and lost income.""

Strzok, who played a lead role in both the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes but became a political lightning rod after the revelation of text messages critical of Trump, wasted no time blasting the administration and House Republicans in his new social media account.

""Deeply saddened by this decision,"" Strzok wrote in the tweet shortly after his firing was announced Monday. ""It has been an honor to serve my country and work with the fine men and women of the FBI.""

He attached an image of a statement from his attorneys that criticized his firing, saying ""the FBI and the American people deserve better."" The letter specifically lambasted the decision of the deputy director of the FBI to effectively overrule the FBI's internal disciplinary body, which had recommended Strzok be suspended and demoted instead of terminated.

FIRED FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR RAISES $500,000 ON GOFUNDME

The Twitter account indicated that it had been established at some point in August, but it has ""liked"" several incendiary posts dating back more than a month.

One post ""liked"" by Strzok's account, written by humorist John Hodgman, calls President Trump a ""moral monster.""

""One reason this is so bracing is that since the election, the tactic of most establishment white dudes (on both sides) has been to blandly ignore, forget, and/or smugly eye-roll past what a moral monster Trump was and is,"" Hodgman wrote.

Another tweet liked by Strzok, written by comedian Jim Carrey, compares Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., to a ""vile insect."" Separately, Strzok also endorsed a tweet by ""Star Wars"" actor Mark Hamill decrying ""complicit treason-weasels"" in the Republican party.

Strzok's account follows a variety of other anti-Trump Twitter users, including Rosie O'Donnell and ex-CIA Director John Brennan.

The GoFundMe account described Strzok as a ""proud husband"" despite his affair with a former FBI lawyer, decried ""politicized"" attacks on his service and asked for money to go into a trust.

TERMINATED JAMES COMEY'S SECRET TWITTER ACCOUNT REVEALED

""Unlike those who typically become the focus of partisan investigations in Washington, Pete is not politically connected, he’s not a wealthy lobbyist and he’s not interested in using his notoriety for personal gain,"" the account stated. ""Because of this, he doesn’t have deep pockets that allow him to pay for the significant legal bills he has incurred to defend himself and the FBI against these political attacks, or to easily cover the expenses incurred by his lost income.""

According to a bombshell report by the Justice Department's inspector general, bureau attorney Lisa Page texted Strzok in August 2016 to ask: “[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!”

“No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it,” Strzok responded. He was having an extramarital affair at the time with Page.

The DOJ watchdog found that Strzok's bevy of anti-Trump texts using FBI-issued phones had undermined the FBI's appearance of impartiality, although the IG did not definitively find that bias specifically motivated any of Strzok's official actions.

SEVEN BOMBSHELL REVELATIONS FROM THE DOJ INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT ON FBI, DOJ BIAS

At an incendiary hearing earlier this year, Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, unloaded on Strzok, asking him ""How many times did you look so innocent into your wife's eyes and lie to her?""

Strzok's actions on Twitter and GoFundMe have some recent precedent. Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired last year, was revealed to have a secret Twitter account himself in late 2017.

And former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired in March -- just days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension -- also set up a GoFundMe account in March. He raised more than a half million dollars before shutting down the account, more than doubling his original goal of $250,000.

McCabe was fired after it was determined that he lied to investigators reviewing the bureau’s probe of Hillary Clinton’s private email server.",politics
"As the second day of Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings got underway, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took to social media to allege the would “help gut or overturn Roe v. Wade” if confirmed to the nation’s highest court.

Kavanaugh, who was appointed by President Trump earlier this year, has never expressed outright opposition to abortion, but his nomination set off warning bells from liberals and women’s rights groups who warned he could vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the U.S.

Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee for president, echoed those concerns in a series of tweets Wednesday morning as the Senate Judiciary Committee began its questioning of Kavanaugh.

“If Brett Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court justice, will he help gut or overturn Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in America? Yes, of course he will,” Clinton said.

ABORTION, ROE V. WADE AT CENTER OF SUPREME COURT NOMINEE DEBATE: WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO THE LANDMARK LAW?

Clinton pointed to Kavanaugh’s involvement in a case of an undocumented teenager who sought to be released from custody to have an abortion. While the court eventually allowed her to have the procedure, Kavanaugh disapproved. He argued if the government helped the 17-year-old get the procedure, then it ignores its “permissible interest in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor and refraining from facilitating abortion.”

“Anti-abortion groups have endorsed Kavanaugh, considering him a reliable vote to overturn Roe. His confirmation would be a victory for activists who want to end a woman’s right to make her own health decisions,” the former New York senator said. “It’s remarkable that we have to keep repeating this, even in 2018: Women’s rights are human rights, and human rights are women’s rights.”

“One of the most fundamental human rights is the right to make the most personal decisions about one’s own body,” she continued. “To deny women that is to rob them of the ability to decide their own futures.”

KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HEARING LIKELY TO FOCUS ON ABORTION, GUN RIGHTS AND MORE

Even if Kavanaugh — considered to be more conservative — is appointed to the bench, the court probably wouldn’t have an impact on Roe anytime soon, Carol Sanger, a Columbia Law School professor, previously told Fox News.

“The court can’t decide to change a case until it has a case before it,” Sanger pointed out. “And the court chooses its own docket so it gets to pick what cases it hears. We don’t know whether they think there is a good case coming up to rule on Roe. They might not want to do that right away.”

If such a case did come up, and the court decided to overturn Roe, abortion wouldn’t necessarily become automatically illegal in the U.S. Instead, it would leave the issue up to the states.

Some states, however, do have more restrictive laws or fewer clinics equipped to provide the procedure already. A full repeal of Roe could lead to more regulations in more conservative states, said Aziza Ahmed, a Northwestern University School of Law professor who has done extensive research on abortion and health law.

Four states do have so-called “trigger laws” in place that would make abortion almost automatically illegal if Roe is overturned: Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota. But still other states — such as New York — already have laws already on the books, pre-dating Roe, which legalizes abortion.

KAVANAUGH DOCUMENTS TAKE CENTER STAGE IN CONFIRMATION HEARING: WHAT DO DEMS WANT?

Kavanaugh’s hearing got off to a contentious start on Sept. 4, with dozens of protesters and lawmakers interrupting the opening statements. U.S. Capitol Police arrested 70 people and charged them with disorderly conduct or with crowding, obstructing, or incommoding, police said.

Among those arrested was UltraViolet executive director Shaunna Thomas, the women's organization confirmed Fox News. Thomas, who co-founded the group focused on reproductive rights and combating sexism, said, “Senators, on behalf of the millions of women across the country whose rights will be stripped by a Kavanaugh court, I demand you reject this nomination,” according to an UltraViolet spokesperson.

Clinton concluded her Wednesday Twitter thread by encouraging those to contact their senators to tell them to vote against confirming Kavanaugh.

On the first day of Kavanaugh’s hearing, Clinton also took to Twitter to oppose the judge. She said those who have a pre-existing condition or “care about someone who has one” should encourage their senators to oppose Kavanaugh. She said he would be a “threat” to ObamaCare.

“This is as serious as it gets. It’s up to us to save health care for millions of our fellow Americans – again,” she said.

Republicans currently command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, though it will return to 51-49 once Jon Kyl, the selected replacement for late Arizona Sen. John McCain, is officially sworn in Wednesday.

If all goes according to Republicans’ plans, Kavanaugh could be sitting on the bench when the Supreme Court begins its new term on Oct. 1.

"Allegations of domestic abuse against Rep. Keith Ellison, the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee and the first Muslim elected to Congress, continued to rock the race for attorney general in Minnesota as voters headed to the polls on Tuesday.

Key primary races were also underway in Connecticut, where Republicans hope to snatch yet another governorship in deep-blue New England, as well as Vermont and Wisconsin. The contests, which include House, Senate, and gubernatorial primaries, are a major test of President Trump's influence in the Midwest ahead of the November midterm elections, as several candidates fight to present themselves as the most pro-Trump choices.

But the abuse allegation against Ellison, who has vowed to fight President Trump's agenda by seeking to restore ObamaCare and net neutrality regulations, loomed especially large nationally. Critics accused party leaders of staying mum on the situation for political reasons.

State attorney general positions like the one Ellison is seeking are increasingly influential nationwide, as state governments escalate their legal assaults on the Trump administration over a variety of policy matters.

Ellison has long been a leader in the Democratic Party. The divorced 54-year-old is a six-term congressman who became deputy chairman of the DNC last year after falling just short of the top job. He was among candidates rushing to file for Minnesota's attorney general office after incumbent Lori Swanson made a late decision to run for governor.

But his efforts to secure the Democratic nomination for Minnesota attorney general were upended this weekend, when the son of Ellison's former girlfriend, Karen Monahan, posted on Facebook that he had seen angry text messages from Ellison to his mother and a video that showed him dragging Monahan off a bed.

Ellison denied any abuse or threatening messages and said the supposed video ""does not exist because I have never behaved in this way.""

Late Tuesday, just hours before polls closed in Minnesota, the DNC issued its first reaction to the allegations.

""These allegations recently came to light and we are reviewing them,"" the DNC told NPR. ""All allegations of domestic abuse are disturbing and should be taken seriously.""

Meanwhile, former DNC communications director Luis Miranda told NPR: ""The party has no choice but to suspend him at a minimum until they figure out what's going on. Frankly, it would be malpractice not to. We've made it clear we're going to take these accusations seriously.""

The DNC's delayed response to the episode had prompted backlash from top conservatives over the weekend.

""It’s great to be the DNC,"" wrote former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer on Twitter Monday. ""If Ellison were a Republican, the press would have knocked over the doors of the RNC demanding a statement. But the DNC’s co-chairman? No comment from the DNC. No feeding frenzy from the press.""

KEITH ELLISON, UNDER FIRE FOR FARRAKHAN TIES, CLAIMS HE HASN'T SEEN THE RACIST LEADER SINCE 2013

Former Trump press sectretary Sean Spicer agreed, saying: ""Not only is the DNC silent, the media has failed to cover it: DNC Silent As Deputy Chair Ellison Battles Domestic Abuse Allegations.""

On Tuesday, Spicer added, ""So the Sierra Club has issued a statement about the allegations against the Deputy DNC chairman......but the DNC still has not ....and most major 'news' outlets don’t seem to have an issue with that.""

With a huge fundraising advantage and star power over his opponents — including a visit from 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders — Ellison was considered the heavy favorite before the Monahan allegation surfaced.

SANDERS ENDORSEMENT THE KISS OF DEATH? SOCIALIST TORCHBEARERS FLAME OUT AFTER HIS RALLIES

Monahan, a Minneapolis political organizer, said via Twitter that her son's posting was ""true."" But she later told Minnesota Public Radio News that she would not release the video because it is ""humiliating.""

Also running in the Democratic primary were state Rep. Debra Hilstrom, former Department of Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman, former Ramsey County Attorney Tom Foley and attorney Matt Pelikan.

Governor's races in Connecticut, Vermont, Minnesota, and Wisconsin

Connecticut is ground-zero for Republican efforts Tuesday to continue their gains in deeply progressive New England. Republicans hold the governorships of four out of six states in the region, including Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire -- which the GOP attributes to its candidates' fiscal conservatism, moderate social policies, and Democrats' financial mismanagement.

Even though Connecticut voted for Hillary Clinton by double-digits in 2016, the state's governor, Dan Malloy, is deeply unpopular, oweing to high taxes and an ongoing budget crisis. Malloy declined to seek a third term.

Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, former First Selectman Tim Herbst, businessman Steve Obsitnik, former investment banker Bob Stefanowski and former hedge fund manager David Stemerman are the Republicans looking to succeed him. They have disagreed on key issues, such as whether to eliminate the state's income tax.

In Vermont, Republican Gov. Phil Scott is favored to win re-election, despite drawing the ire of conservative critics by signing the state's first major gun control law earlier this year. No sitting governor has been defeated in Vermont since 1962.

WATCH: PROTESTERS HECKLE 'TRAITOR' VERMONT GOVERNOR FOR SIGNING ANTI-GUN LAW

Two Democrats are vying to make history in the state on Tuesday, despite long odds. Christine Hallquist is vying to be the first openly transgender woman to serve as a U.S. governor. A former CEO of the Vermont Electric Cooperative, Hallquist is focused on tackling climate change and implementing universal health care in the Green Mountain State.

And a 14-year old boy, Ethan Sonneborn, has also thrown his hat into the ring, taking advantage of the state constitution's lack of an age requirement to seek the governorship.

Meanwhile, in Minnesota, Tim Pawlenty -- who briefly ran for president in 2012 -- is hoping to stage a political comeback and become Minnesota’s governor again, in a race to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton that Fox News considers a tossup.

Pawlenty has said he voted for Trump, but later called the president ""unhinged and unfit"" -- which may alienate conservatives in the state.

During the campaign, Pawlenty and Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson have spent much of their time in the campaign fighting over who previously insulted the president the least. Both men criticized Trump during the 2016 campaign, with Johnson calling the president a ""jackass"" and Pawlenty pulling his support after the ""Access Hollywood tape"" of Trump bragging he could grope women because he was famous.

Now, they both say they voted for Trump in the end and would welcome the president's support. Trump has not endorsed either candidate.

Pawlenty is seeking the nomination against several other Republicans, including Jeff Johnson, who was the party’s 2014 gubernatorial nominee. On the Democrats’ side are: state Rep. Erin Murphy, Minnesota Attorney Gen. Lori Swanson and U.S. Rep. Tim Walz.

Finally, in Wisconsin, Democrats are making yet another effort to unseat Republican Scott Walker, a well-known union buster who is seeking a third term. A bevy of Democrats with some high-profile endorsements are competing for the right to take him on in November.

House and Senate races

A series of House and Senate races are also underway Tuesday. Broadly, Republicans are looking to make gains by winning some House seats in Minnesota, while Democrats are targeting House races in Wisconsin and Minnesota.

Perhaps the most notable races are in Wisconsin, where Democrats are fiercely competing for the nomination to succeed outgoing Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who announced his resignation earlier this year. Teacher Cathy Myers and union leader Randy Bryce are locked in a battle for the Democratic nomination; Ryan-backed businessman Bryan Steil is leading the GOP pack.

Also in Wisconsin, Republicans Kevin Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir are seeking to oust Sen. Tammy Baldwin in November. The seat is considered essential for Democrats if they want to hold the Senate, and in a sign of the race's importance, more than $35M has been spent in the race.

The state party is backing Vukmir, an ally of Gov. Scott Walker. But her critique of Trump as ""offensive to everyone"" during the 2016 primaries has provided an opening for Nicholson, a Marine veteran and former Democrat who spoke on behalf of Vice President Al Gore at the 2000 Democratic National Convention.

"Although critics have charged that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has advanced her career with a narrative that she is a distant descendant of Cherokee and Delaware tribes, Harvard University never considered her ethnicity when it hired her as a law professor, according to a report Saturday.

The Boston Globe reported interviews and documents showed that the issue was not considered by Harvard Law faculty when it considered her application in the 1990s.

The report also saw no consideration of her race when she applied to work at Rutgers, the University of Houston, the University of Texas or the University of Pennsylvania.

“She was not on the radar screen at all in terms of a racial minority hire,” Randall Kennedy, a law professor who was in charge of recruiting minority candidates to Harvard Law School, told the Globe. “It was just not an issue. I can’t remember anybody ever mentioning her in this context.”

Neither Harvard nor Warren immediately returned Fox News’ requests for comment Sunday.

The Globe noted that Warren listed herself as a “minority” before Penn offered her a job. However, the law school’s dean and affirmative action officer wrote in a 1987 equal opportunity compliance statement form that Warren was the best candidate for her job despite being “white.”

The report also noted that nearly three years after she took the Penn job, she asked the university to change her listed ethnicity to “Native American.” A 2005 university publication noting a teaching award that she won a decade earlier listed her as a minority, the Globe added.

The newspaper reported that it examined hundreds of documents, many of them never before available, and talked to 31 law school professors from that period at Harvard. All but one said her Native American heritage was not discussed as part of the decision to hire her. One said he was unsure if the issue came up, but if it did, it had no bearing on his vote.

Warren on Sunday posted on her website documents related to her job and school applications and again asserted that her heritage played no role in her career advancement.

“My family is my family,” the outspoken progressive told the Globe. “But my background played no role in my getting hired anywhere.”

President Trump repeatedly has referred to Warren as “Pocahontas” in mocking her claims of heritage.

Warren, 69, is seeking reelection in November, and is set to face one of three Republicans running in a primary on Tuesday. She repeatedly has said she’s not running for president in 2020, but continues to position herself as a national leader in the Democratic Party.

"Sen. Bernie Sanders is all over the internet!

New York Magazine says he is “quietly building a digital media empire.”

Mic.com calls it “one of the most powerful progressive media outfits in America.”

This matters because bettors rank Sanders one of the top four Democratic presidential contenders.

I resent Sanders’ “empire” because it pushes bad ideas, yet his videos are viewed more often than mine. His videos have been seen almost a billion times.

Some are just recordings of him making noisy speeches, ranting about how Republican policies hurt Americans. For example, “Tens of thousands of them will die” if ObamaCare is repealed. (He ignores the fact that more will live if the economy is allowed to grow.)

Other Sanders videos are edited, produced pieces, much like videos that I make.

One powerful one begins with a President Trump speech where the president recites the song “The Snake,” in which a woman nurses a snake back to health -- only to have it bite her. “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in!” shouts the president. He was arguing against loose immigration controls.

But the video cuts to Trump calling criminals “animals,” and an “expert” says Trump is using “the same kind of language that the Nazis used.”

The video never mentions that when Trump said “animals,” he was talking about MS-13.

A recurring Sanders video theme is that Trump supporters are “faces of greed” who scheme to get even richer by doing things like abolishing the estate tax.

Sanders never mentions that the estate tax taxes money that had already been taxed; it’s double taxation.

He could still argue against repealing it, but he ought to be fair.

Many Sanders videos demand that government make college free.

His staff interview themselves.

May Ayad, a Sanders associate media producer, tells us, “It’s not just one or two people saying, ‘I can’t afford to go to college.’ This is like the majority of college students in the entire nation!”

Winn Decker, research intern for the Senate Budget Committee, whines, “Student loans kept me from doing things like purchase a home.”

Sanders staff assistant Terrel Champion tells viewers, “Somebody has to foot the bill. The government should assume that responsibility!”

There’s no mention of how existing government subsidies already raised the price of tuition, enabling it to grow faster than the rate of inflation. There’s also not a peep about how Sanders’ own wife bankrupted a college in Vermont.

It’s just: Government must pay more!

Government should take responsibility for your health care, too, says a Sanders video that describes MSNBC anchor Ali Velshi as a “Canadian capitalist” who says, “Nowhere on Earth is there a free health insurance market that works.”

The video looks like a debate between Velshi and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, but it’s edited so that Jordon doesn’t get to say much.

It’s easy to win an argument if you barely let the other guy speak.

There’s also no mention of the fact that the Urban Institute says Sanders’ “Medicare for All” plan would cost the federal government $32 trillion between 2017 and 2026.

Maybe the biggest theme of Sanders’ videos is the wealth gap, which Bernie says “is not only immoral (but) causes suffering for the working families (because) the poor are getting poorer.”

But that’s just wrong. The poor are not getting poorer. The wealth gap doesn’t cause suffering. Yes, rich people got richer, but the poor and middle class got richer, too. Sanders never acknowledges that.

Sanders posts a new economically ignorant video most every day.

He says it would be “easy” to have free health care, free college, a living wage. How will it all be paid for? Simple. Raise taxes.

One Sanders video shows rich people shouting, “Tax me!” and “I should be paying more!”

So pay more! No one’s stopping you! Just don’t demand that everyone else pay more.

Socialists think government is the solution to every problem. They also pretend that what government provides is free.

Sanders’ videos would be just a joke if millions didn’t watch.",politics
"U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Pakistan Wednesday where he is expected to meet with the country’s new prime minster in an effort to curb strained relations between the two countries.

Pompeo’s goal to “reset” the uneasy relationship could be complicated by the appointment of veteran diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad as the special advisor on reconciliation in Afghanistan.

An Afghan native, Khalilzad’s job will be to bring the Taliban and Afghan government together toward rapprochement.

“He has been very critical of Pakistan in the past and his appointment will not help move things forward,” said Zahid Hussain, a defense analyst and author of two books on militancy in the region.

Khalilzad previously served under George W. Bush as the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq and as a U.N. ambassador.

While in Pakistan, Pompeo will meet with Prime Minister Imran Khan as well as the country’s foreign minister and army chief.

Later in the day, he will leave for India where Afghanistan and bringing an end to the war are likely to be discussed.

"The Justice Department inspector general has referred five FBI employees for investigation in connection with politically charged texts, revealing in its report on the Hillary Clinton email case that more bureau officials than previously thought were exchanging anti-Trump messages.

The long-awaited report largely dealt with the Justice Department and FBI's handling of the Clinton case but uncovered numerous messages that “appeared to mix political opinion with discussions about the MYE investigation.""

MYE, or ""Midyear Exam,"" was the code used in the FBI to refer to the investigation into Clinton’s private email server.

“Some of these text messages and instant messages mixed political commentary with discussions about the Midyear investigation, and raised concerns that political bias may have impacted investigative decisions,” the report read.

The report noted that it was specifically concerned about text messages exchanged between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page that “potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations.”

Strzok and Page, who were romantically involved, both served for a short period of time on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation team. Strzok was reassigned following the revelations of his anti-Trump texts. Page resigned last month.

But while many of those texts were made public in late 2017, the IG report revealed a new one in which Strzok vowed to ""stop"" Trump from becoming president -- and made clear that as many as five total FBI employees exchanged politically charged messages. ""The text messages and instant messages sent by these employees included statements of hostility toward then candidate Trump and statements of support for candidate Clinton,"" the report said.

The report revealed instant messages between unnamed agents, labeled “Agent 1” and “Agent 5,” discussing their jobs in August 2016.

“I find anyone who enjoys [this job] an absolute f---ing idiot. If you don’t think so, ask them one more question. Who are you voting for? I guarantee you it will be Donald Drumpf,” Agent 1 sent.

“I forgot about drumpf…that’s so sad and pathetic if they want to vote for him,” Agent 5 responded. “Someone who can’t answer a question. Someone who can’t be professional for even a second.”

In September, Agent 1 and 5 conversed again, bashing Trump supporters as “retarded.”

“I’m trying to think of a ‘would I rather’ instead of spending time with those people,” Agent 5 sent.

Agent 1 asked, “stick your tongue in a fan??”

Agent 5 later wrote: “I would rather have brunch with trump and a bunch of his supporters like the ones from ohio that are retarded.”

The report did not, however, find evidence connecting those political opinions held by FBI officials to decisions made in the Clinton investigation.

“There were clearly tensions and disagreements in a number of important areas between Midyear agents and prosecutors. However, we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions…,” the report read. “Nonetheless, these messages cast a cloud over the FBI’s handling of the Midyear investigation and the investigation’s credibility.”

Futher, the report said that while it found no evidence the views influenced investigative decisions, “five employees” have been referred for investigation into whether the messages violated FBI code.

“The FBI will handle these referrals pursuant to the FBI’s disciplinary investigation and adjudication processes, and will impose disciplinary measures as warranted,” the report read.

It is unclear which five FBI employees have been referred for investigation.

An FBI spokesperson told Fox News Thursday they were not able to comment on the names of the five employees referred for investigation.

The IG report included a new text conversation between Strzok and Page from August 2016.

“[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!” Page texted Strzok.

“No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it,” Strzok responded.

Those texts “caused [the OIG] to question the earlier Midyear investigative decisions in which he was involved, and whether he took specific actions in the Midyear investigation based on his political views,” the report read.

In a statement to Fox News, Strzok’s attorney Aitan Goelman defended Strzok’s work at the FBI.

“After a year-long investigation that included a review of millions of communications and interviews of scores of witnesses, the IG concluded that there is no evidence that the political views of Special Agent Strzok and others in the FBI impacted the handling of the Clinton email investigation,” Goelman said in a statement. “As the Report notes, Special Agent Strzok in particular was consistently thorough and aggressive, sometimes to the point that put him at odds with senior officials at the Department of Justice.”

Goelman added: “While pundits and politicians are using this matter to advance their agendas, the truth about Special Agent Strzok’s character and professionalism is found in the fact that every witness asked by the OIG said that Strzok’s work was never influenced by political views. His dedication to unbiased service is a fact that would be universally echoed by the thousands of people who have worked with Pete during his 26 years of service in the FBI and U.S. Army.”

The report also reveals that one FBI attorney assigned to the special counsel's team was found to have sent politically charged FBINet instant messages to other FBI officials.

That FBI employee sent messages such as: ""As I have initiated the destruction of the republic...Would you be so kind as to have a coffee with me this afternoon?""

Another instant message read: ""I'm clinging to small pockets of happiness in the dark time of the Republic's destruction.""

The report did not reveal this FBI official's name, but did state that the official worked on both the Clinton email investigation and the Russia probe.

The FBI official left the special counsel's team in February of this year, following revelations of his politically charged messages.

The special counsel's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment on the investigator who left the team in February.",politics
"Just hours after a Massachusetts man was arrested for allegedly offering $500 bounties for killing ICE agents, a Republican candidate for a U.S. Senate seat in the state said his Democratic opponent shared in the blame.

GOP candidate Geoff Diehl demanded Thursday that incumbent U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren “both retract and apologize” for the criticism that he said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel have taken from her and other Democrats in recent months, the Boston Herald reported.

“We now have a man putting a bounty on the heads of ICE agents,” Diehl said in a statement. “Senator Warren’s irresponsible statements are partially to blame. She has a responsibility to support our law enforcement officials. Her call to abolish ICE and painting the entire criminal justice system racists are reckless and dangerous.”

""Senator Warren ... has a responsibility to support our law enforcement officials. Her call to abolish ICE and painting the entire criminal justice system racists are reckless and dangerous.” - Geoff Diehl, Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Massachusetts

The suspect, identified as Brandon Ziobrowski, 33, of Cambridge, Mass., was arrested Thursday in New York, charged with one count of use of interstate and foreign commerce to transmit a threat and injure another person.

MASSACHUSETTS MAN SOLICITED KILLING ICE AGENTS FOR $500, TWEETED DESIRE TO SLIT THROAT OF McCAIN, FEDS SAY

On July 2, Ziobrowski allegedly tweeted: “I am broke but will scrounge and literally give $500 to anyone who kills ICE agent. @me seriously who else can pledge get in on this lets make this work.”

Federal officials also said Ziabrowski had tweeted a desire to slit the throat of U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

“He appears to be very much against ICE and its mission. He appears to have a violent dislike for at least one Republican senator and law enforcement,"" U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said at a news conference announcing Ziabrowski’s arrest.

Diehl, meanwhile, suggested that Warren, too, seemed opposed to ICE and its mission.

“We need a Senator who will support our police and not throw (ICE) under the bus to score political points,” Diehl’s statement continued. “Warren should be putting public safety first. Instead she is prioritizing her White House political ambitions to the detriment of law enforcement.”

Speaking at a rally in Boston on June 30, Warren slammed President Trump’s immigration policies, saying “we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our morality and that works.”

Other top Democrats who’ve called for ICE to be abolished include U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of Vermont and congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

DEMOCRATS CALLING FOR ICE TO BE ABOLISHED INCLUDE KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, ELIZABETH WARREN, OTHERS

But in a response to Diehl’s comments, Warren’s office told the Herald that the senator opposes any form of violence against law enforcement officers.

“We can have respectful discussions and civil discourse on policy while working together to improve lives,” the senator’s office said in a statement.

Diehl, 49, currently serves in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, representing the 7th Plymouth District.

Warren, 69, has served in the U.S. Senate since 2013.

"President Trump, in an exclusive interview with Fox News' Ainsley Earhardt, warned that the “market would crash” if he's ever impeached -- while questioning why Democrats would even consider that course in the future.

“I don’t know how you can impeach somebody who’s done a great job,” Trump said, in the interview which aired Thursday on ""Fox & Friends.""

The president weighed in on calls from the left to pursue impeachment if Democrats seize the House in the midterms. That speculation kicked up following the plea deal struck by his former attorney Michael Cohen claiming the president was involved in hush-money payments and admitting campaign finance violations related to them.

The president argued that he's done a great job in office, despite the critical coverage in connection with the Cohen case and other controversies.

Further, he warned, “If I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, I think everybody would be very poor, because without this thinking, you would see — you would see numbers that you wouldn’t believe in reverse.”

The president touted his economic accomplishments, claiming that the economy was going to be “down” if he hadn’t been elected.

“I freed up, I got rid of regulations, the tax cut was a tremendous thing,” Trump said.

He added: “Had Hillary and the Democrats gotten in, had she been president, you would have had negative growth. We picked up $10 trillion worth.”

Impeachment talk is still confined to certain corners of the Democratic Party. Top House Democrats have largely pushed back on calls to pursue that option, though some have kept the door open.

Many Democrats have said the Cohen plea creates legal risks for Trump. ""The factual basis of the plea, potentially implicating the president in illegal campaign finance violations, adds to the president’s legal jeopardy,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., top House Intelligence Committee Democrat, said in a statement.

The president also hit on immigration in the interview — saying “we’re doing a record-breaking job, but we have bad laws.”

“You know when you have bad laws you can do good. But you can do a lot better if you had good laws. So they’ll all get changed, but we have to elect more Republicans,” Trump said.

The president was asked about the murder of 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts, whom he called “a beautiful young girl.”

“She was killed by a horrible person that came in from Mexico, illegally here. Found by ICE, our great ICE who’s abused by the Democrats and the left. And without them, you might not be sitting here so comfortably right now. I just think it’s so sad,” Trump said.

Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, in the U.S. illegally from Mexico, was charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday in Tibbetts’ death. He is currently being held on a federal immigration detainer.

“We’re building the wall. It’s already started. We’ve spent $3.2 billion on it. We’re asking for $5 billion for this year’s funding. The wall is going up. A lot of people don’t know it,” Trump said.

He added that he would “like to build it even faster,” but said working with the Democrats is “very tough.”

“We’re doing an incredible job,” Trump said.

The president said he would give himself and his presidency, thus far, an “A plus.”

“I don’t think any president has ever done what I’ve done in this short, we haven’t even been two years, biggest tax cuts in history, soon-to-be two unbelievable Supreme Court justices—I’m sure that Justice Kavanaugh will be approved, Justice Gorsuch has been a star,” Trump said. “You look at all of the things we’ve done with regulations, the economy is the best it’s ever been in history.”

Trump announced Brett Kavanaugh as his choice to replace retired Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy on the bench. His confirmation hearing is expected in the Senate in early September, though some Democrats are pushing for delays after the Cohen plea.

The one area where Trump said he was not succeeding was with the media.

“The only thing I’m doing badly on is the press doesn’t cover me fairly,” Trump said. “I thought after I won, you know, they killed me during the campaign. Just killed me. I said well, one good thing about winning, I’ve showed them, so now I’m going to get fair press.”

He added: “Guess what, it got worse. It’s worse.”

The president has routinely mocked and attacked media outlets — like CNN, NBC, The New York Times, and The Washington Post -- over critical stories that he often disputes. Last week, more than 300 publications across the country participated in coordinated editorial columns promoting freedom of the press and criticizing Trump.

Trump went on to criticize the media coverage of his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, last month.

“My meeting with Putin was a tremendous success, I got killed by the fake news,” Trump said. “They wanted me to go up and punch him in the face. I said I want to get along with Russia. I want to get along with everybody.”

He added: “They said I was too rough on North Korea, remember that, too rough. But with Putin, they said I was too soft.”

The president angered members of both parties at the Putin summit by saying both countries share blame for damaged relations and by not firmly standing by U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections.

Trump praised his wife, Melania Trump, for her grace through negative media coverage of the first family and his administration.

“She is doing great. She's a terrific woman. She goes through a lot with all this publicity. But she's a terrific woman, she's doing great,” Trump said, adding that unfavorable coverage and publicity is “part of my life.”

He added: “I’ve always won. I’ve always won. It was controversial when I ran, and I won, and now the country’s doing better than it’s ever done.”",politics
"Several big seats are up for grabs in Arizona in this year’s midterm elections and already the races are expected to be tight.

President Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in Arizona by about 4 percentage points — and many races in this year’s midterms election are predicted to be just as close. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey is up for re-election, and there’s a fierce battle for a Senate seat left vacant by outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake, a vocal critic of the president.

Democrats have their sights set on a few congressional races in Arizona, too, during their quest to regain control of the House.

Read on for a look at the races to watch in the Aug. 28 primary elections.

Governor

In the race for governor in Arizona, education is playing a big role. Thousands of educators walked out of their classrooms in April, closing down schools, to protest for more pay and resources.

The average starting salary for teachers in Arizona for the 2016-2017 school year was $34,068, less than the national average of $38,617, according to statistics from the National Education Association.

Incumbent Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican running for re-election, has stuck by his plan to increase teacher pay by 20 percent over four years. And as the Arizona Capitol Times previously reported, when Ducey took office, the state’s per student funding was already low at $4,154; it is now $4,720. During the 2011-2012 school year, before he took office, it sank as low as $3,814, according to the Capitol Times.

But GOP challenger Ken Bennett, Arizona’s former secretary of state who unsuccessfully challenged Ducey before, criticized the governor’s handling of the teacher walkouts and told the Arizona Republic he decided to run because of the “panic and flip-flopping of the governor” with his plan.

ARIZONA TEACHERS STATE ‘WALK-IN’ TO DEMAND HIGHER PAY, MORE RESOURCES

As for the Democrats, Army veteran and Arizona State University professor David Garcia has emerged as a frontrunner. A more progressive Democrat, Garcia is an advocate for public schools and free college tuition.

Gubernatorial hopeful Steve Farley, a former state senator and artist, has raised more money in the primary than his Democratic counterparts. His campaign website touts him as a “strong advocate for public transit and other transportation improvements” in Arizona. According to the Capitol Times, Farley is a policy wonk with an abundance of knowledge about the state budget.

ARIZONA SCHOOLS CLOSE AS THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS PROTEST FOR MORE PAY

A third Democratic candidate, Kelly Fryer, is the YWCA Southern Arizona CEO and a political activist who spoke at a local Women’s March event last year, the Arizona Daily Star reported. She said friends had encouraged her to seek political office for a while, but she decided to run because she was “tired of watching people struggle because of the things our legislators are doing.”

Fox News has ranked the gubernatorial race as leaning Republican.

Senate

The race to replace outgoing Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who held the seat since 2013, has been bruising as three candidates battle it out for the GOP nomination.

Rep. Martha McSally has seemingly emerged as the frontrunner, pulling ahead of her two GOP opponents in recent local polls. In her campaign, McSally has focused on border security and immigration issues, saying she supports building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.

While talking about the separation of children and families at the border, McSally told KGUN-TV law enforcement officials should not be put “in a position where they have to choose between enforcing the law and keeping families together.”

FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS HEADQUARTERS

Also running in the Republican primary is Kelli Ward, a controversial and outspoken conservative who unsuccessfully challenged Arizona Sen. John McCain for his seat in 2016. A former state senator, Ward had already planned to run for Flake’s seat even before he announced he would retire. While Flake has often been an outspoken critic of Trump, Ward has been an ardent defender of the president.

McSally and Ward traded jabs during a July debate, hitting each other over their credentials and who has more solid policy positions. The attacks also got personal at one point.

“And you know, I’m not a trained killer,” Ward said. “I am a trained problem-solver. I’m a trained healer. And I think that’s what we need in Washington.”

The Arizona Republic reported that McSally, an Air Force veteran who served 26 years in the military, seemed disturbed by the comment.

Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is also vying for the Republican nomination, although the Arizona Republic has reported his campaign is experiencing detrimental problems — including the loss of a prominent staffer — ahead of the primary. Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt for denying a judge’s order to stop traffic patrols that targeted illegal immigrants in July 2017; Trump pardoned him a month later.

Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and attorney Deedra Abboud are battling it out for the Democratic nomination for Senate.

ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE’S STAFFER RESIGNS AFTER OLD INFLAMMATORY TWEETS SURFACE

Sinema, who also served in the state legislature, is Democrats’ best hope to flip the seat blue in November. Fox News has ranked the Senate election as leaning Democrat. Sinema is a more moderate candidate than some progressives may have hoped. She’s been openly critical of ObamaCare and said she does not support Medicare for all.

Abboud, who focuses on immigration law, told KGUN she’s concerned about whether people coming across the border illegally are safe. She’s against the border wall because she said it could be harmful to the environment. She’s also focused her campaign on racial issues in the U.S., according to KGUN.

6th congressional district

While incumbent GOP Rep. David Schweikert should hold onto his seat, Democrats have fixed their attention on this race as one that they could flip as Schweikert is under a House Ethics Committee investigation for alleged misuse of official funds and campaign contributions.

Attorney Garrick McFadden said he wants to work for Medicare for all, citing his mother’s cancer diagnosis when he was a child. In a campaign ad, McFadden said he got a job when he was 12 years old in order to help his family with the financial burdens of health care costs.

Heather Ross is an Arizona State University professor and nurse practitioner. With her background in heatlhcare, Ross is an advocate for expanding Medicare as well as access to mental health programs. She also supports greater gun control and strengthening the country’s alliance with Israel, according to her campaign website.

Anita Malik said she quit her job as chief operating officer of a technology company to run for office. After she lost her father to cancer, she’s become a proponent for healthy and compassionate work environments, her campaign website said.

2nd congressional district

Rep. Martha McSally left her seat open when she decided to run for Senate, and Fox News has it ranked as leaning Democrat.

A large number of candidates — both Democrats and Republicans —are vying for the seat. The 2nd congressional district, which encompasses much of Tucson and butts up to the U.S.-Mexico border, is one that is pretty equally divided among political parties, according to the Arizona Republic.

Ann Kirkpatrick represented Arizona’s 1st congressional district in two non-consecutive terms. She also unsuccessfully challenged Sen. John McCain in 2016. She’s backed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has listed her as one of its “Red to Blue candidate.”

Physician and former state Rep. Matt Heinz has made health care and gun control some of his top issues. He raised eyebrows just ahead of the primary when he compared Kirkpatrick to a meth addict during an interview with National Journal.

“All she can think about is, ‘What do I have to do to put that damnable little pin on my lapel,’” Heinz said. “That’s all she can see, and I understand it because I’ve had to treat people with meth addiction.”

Small business owner Billy Kovacs has been compared to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic socialist who won over progressives when she defeated longtime incumbent Rep. Joseph Crowley in New York’s Democratic primary earlier this year. Kovacs supports Medicare for all and raising the minimum wage while he opposes a border wall.

Then there’s Mary Matiella, who served as a financial manager for the U.S. Army during the Obama administration; Barbara Sherry, whose campaign website calls her a “LGBT mortgage-broker-turned-rancher;” former state Rep. Bruce Wheeler, who was also a Tucson city councilman; and Yahya Yuksel, an attorney, who are gunning for the Democratic nomination.

Yuksel faces calls to drop out of the race for allegedly raping a 16-year-old girl while drinking at a friend’s house in 2007. He has denied the allegations.

Republican Lea Marquez Peterson is the president and CEO of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. She supports greater border security — including a wall — and repealing ObamaCare. When it comes to Trump, she told Politico that she’s focused “on the policy and things that I can actually impact” as opposed to comments he’s made about women that she disagrees with.

“I kind of separate the man from the policy,” she said.

Army veteran Brandon Martin, too, supports a border wall and included a quote from White House chief of staff John Kelly on his campaign website to drive his point home.

Danny Morales is a Navy veteran and local politician who served as the vice mayor of Douglas and on its city council. Douglas is in southern Arizona, right on the U.S.-Mexico border.

"President Trump blasted his former attorney, Michael Cohen, for “flipping” on him and praised another ex-lieutenant with legal trouble, Paul Manafort, in an exclusive “Fox & Friends” interview with Ainsely Earhardt airing Thursday morning.

The sit-down comes during a dizzying week that saw Cohen plead guilty and Manafort get convicted for crimes that mostly had to do with their personal business dealings. But Cohen also admitted making hush money payments on behalf of Trump in what prosecutors say amounted to campaign violations.

“[Cohen] makes a better deal when he uses me, like everybody else,” Trump said. “And one of the reasons I respect Paul Manafort so much is he went through that trial—you know they make up stories. People make up stories. This whole thing about flipping, they call it, I know all about flipping.”

He continued: “For 30, 40 years I’ve been watching flippers. Everything’s wonderful and then they get 10 years in jail and they—they flip on whoever the next highest one is, or as high as you can go.”

Cohen, Trump's former longtime personal attorney and self-described “fixer,” pleaded guilty Tuesday to five counts of tax evasion, one count of bank fraud, one count linked to an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count stemming from an illegal campaign contribution. The tax and fraud charges were tied to his dealings with a taxi business, while the campaign finance charges related to arranging payments to adult film star Storm Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal “at the direction” of then-candidate Trump.

Cohen is facing up to 65 years in prison on all the counts, but prosecutors have pledged to reduce his sentence sharply as part of the plea deal.

“It almost ought to be outlawed. It’s not fair. Because if somebody’s going to give—spend five years like Michael Cohen, or 10 years, or 15 years in jail because of a taxi cab industry, because he defrauded some bank—the last two were tiny ones,” Trump explained. “You know, campaign violations are considered not a big deal, frankly. But if somebody defrauded a bank and he’s going to get 10 years in jail or 20 years in jail, but if you can say something bad about Donald Trump and you’ll go down to two or three years, which is the deal he made.”

Trump said that “in all fairness” to Cohen, “most people are going to do that.”

“I’ve seen it many times,” Trump said. “I’ve had many friends involved in this stuff. It’s called flipping and it almost ought to be illegal.”

He laid out a scenario in which “you get 10 years in jail, but if you say bad things about somebody in other words, make up stories if you don’t know. Make up. They just make up lies. I’ve seen it many times.”

“They make up things and now they go from 10 years to they’re a national hero. They have a statue erected in their honor. It’s not a fair thing, but that’s why [Cohen] did it,” Trump said.

Trump also seemingly distanced himself from Cohen, downplaying a relationship which spanned over a decade.

“He was a lawyer for me, one of many,"" Trump said. ""You know, they always say, 'the lawyer,' and then they like to add 'the fixer.'” Well, I don’t know if he was a 'fixer.' I don’t know where that term came from. But he’s been a lawyer for me. Didn’t do big deals, did small deals. Not somebody that was with me that much.”

He added: “You know, they make it sound like I didn’t live with—without him. I understood Michael Cohen very well. He—well, it turned out he wasn’t a very good lawyer, frankly.”

Trump said that Cohen worked for him for about 10 years, and he would “see him sometimes,” but noted that while Cohen was involved in big deals, Trump had “outside lawyers” and “inside lawyers, too.”

“I always found him to be a nice guy,” Trump said.

At issue involving the president is the $130,000 payment to Daniels in the weeks prior to the 2016 presidential election in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump, as well as the McDougal case. McDougal was paid $150,000 by the parent company of the National Enquirer for her, separate, story about an alleged 2006 affair with Trump, which it never published. Cohen admitted Tuesday to making an excessive campaign contribution and causing an unlawful corporate contribution.

But Trump insisted he only knew about hush-money payments made by Cohen “later on,” despite Cohen’s claims to the contrary.

“Later on I knew. Later on. What he did –and they weren’t taken out of the campaign finance, that’s the big thing. That’s a much bigger thing,” Trump said. “Did they come out of the campaign? They didn’t come out of the campaign, they came from me.”

He added: “In fact, my first question when I heard about it was, did they come out of the campaign, because that could be a little dicey. And they didn’t come out of the campaign and that’s big. But they weren’t…that’s not even a campaign violation.”

“If you look at President Obama, he had a massive campaign violation but he had a different attorney general and they viewed it a lot differently,” Trump said. Trump was referring to Obama's 2008 campaign being fined $375,000 by the Federal Election Commission for a series of missing notices for more than 1,300 contributions. They totaled $1.8 million.

Trump, though, went on to criticize Attorney General Jeff Sessions, saying he “never took control of the Justice Department."" When asked whether he would fire Sessions or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he maintained that he wants to “stay uninvolved” with the DOJ.

“Jeff Sessions recused himself, which he shouldn’t have done. Or he should have told me,” Trump said. “Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you wouldn’t have put him in. He took the job and then he said I’m going to recuse myself. I said, ‘what kind of man is this?’”

Trump added that the “only reason” he appointed him as attorney general was “because I felt loyalty.”

“He was an original supporter. He was on the campaign. He knows there was no collusion,” Trump said. “And what’s come out of Manafort? No collusion. What’s come out of Michael Cohen? No collusion.”

This week, Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, was charged on eight counts of tax fraud as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Unlike Cohen, Trump noted in the exclusive interview with “Fox & Friends,” Manafort did not ‘flip.’

""I have great respect for what he's done in terms of what he's going through. You know, he worked for Ronald Reagan for years. He worked for Bob Dole. He worked, I guess his firm worked, for [Sen. John] McCain. He worked for many, many people many, many years, and I would say what he did, some of the charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does,"" Trump said.

He added: ""If you look at Hillary Clinton's person, you take a look at the people that work for Hillary Clinton, and look at the crimes that Clinton did with the emails and she deletes 33,000 emails after she gets a subpoena from Congress, and this Justice Department does nothing about it and all of the other crimes that they've done.""

Trump said he ""didn't know Manafort well,"" and that his charges were ""on things totally unrelated to the campaign.""

""And by the way, they got Cohen on [charges] totally unrelated to the campaign,"" Trump explained. ""I'm not involved. I wasn't charged with anything. You know, people don't like to say that, but I wasn't charged.""",politics
"President Trump’s favored candidate, GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis, defeated state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam in Florida’s Republican gubernatorial primary on Tuesday after riding the wave of the president's enthusiastic endorsement to victory.

Meanwhile, the Bernie Sanders-backed Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum pulled off a major upset in defeating a half a dozen rivals, including former Rep. Gwen Graham, in the Democratic primary.

DeSantis and Gillum will face each other in November's general election. If he triumphs, Gillum would be the state's first black governor.

During a celebration event in Orlando, DeSantis thanked the president for ""viewing me as somebody who could be a great leader for Florida.""

""Our victory is a good victory, anyways,"" DeSantis said, complimenting Putnam on a hard-fought race. ""But man, to beat someone of his caliber is a big, big deal.""

The president repeatedly had implored voters to support DeSantis over Putnam. Trump offered his congratulations on Twitter.

""Such a fantastic win for Ron DeSantis and the people of the Great State of Florida,"" Trump tweeted. ""Ron will be a fantastic Governor. On to November!""

Appearing on the ""Ingraham Angle"" later, DeSantis downplayed the notion that his win was due to the president's backing, and touted his record on combatting environmental problems, illegal immigration, and education reform.

""We've been talking about these key issues time and time again and we're going to continue to do that and spread the message far and wide,"" he said.

Gillum, Tallahassee’s progressive mayor backed by the Democratic-socialist Sanders, shocked observers with his win, as Graham, the daughter of former Florida Governor and Sen. Bob Graham, led in pre-election polls.

""I'm truly honored to represent people across the state as the Democratic nominee -- and I promise to stand up for everyday Floridians and the issues that matter most,"" Gillum tweeted after his win.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic socialist star running for New York's 14th district, praised Gillum for staking out liberal positions by supporting Medicare for all, legalizing marijuana and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“The progressive movement is transforming the country - and he proved that again tonight,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.

In the state's closely-watched Senate contest, Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott on Tuesday easily won the GOP nomination. He faced a challenge from perennial candidate Roque De La Fuente.

""Congratulations to Governor Rick Scott of Florida on his conclusive Republican Primary Win,"" Trump, who encouraged Scott to run, tweeted. ""He will be a great Senator!""

Scott, who is term-limited as governor, is set to face incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in what surely will be one of the most closely watched Senate races in November. Nelson ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.

But much of the attention in the run-up to Tuesday's vote had been on the contentious Republican gubernatorial primary between DeSantis and Putnam.

During a Fox News-sponsored debate in June, DeSantis played up Trump’s backing of his campaign, expressing doubt that Putnam adequately supported Trump. “I am proud to have the endorsement of President Trump in this race,” DeSantis said.

DeSantis, 39, is an Iraq War veteran and decorated military lawyer who has served in the U.S. House since 2013. He is a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School.

Putnam, 44, also played up his support for Trump, but emphasized, “I am focused on Florida.”

As for the Senate race, Republicans are hoping Scott could flip the seat in a battle with Nelson, one of the Democratic Party’s most vulnerable incumbents.

Trump narrowly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in Florida in the 2016 presidential race by less than 2 percentage points.

It was a good night for incumbents in House races in Florida, as Republican Carlos Curbelo and Democrat Stephanie Murphy were among those who beat back primary challengers.

National Democrats have eyed Curbelo's 26th congressional district as a potential pickup target, in large part because it voted heavily for Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. But with almost all precincts reporting, approximately 2,500 more people had turned out to vote in the GOP primary than in the Democratic primary.

Curbelo garnered 84 percent of the vote against primary opponent Souraya Faas, who described Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad as ""heroes"" and claimed chemical attacks in Syria's civil war were ""staged.""

In November, Curbelo will face Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a former associate dean at the Florida International University Medical School and Democratic candidate for state Senate.

Murphy, who unseated GOP incumbent John Mica in 2016, easily defeated a primary challenge in the 7th District from Chardo Richardson, who was backed by Ocasio-Cortez. She will face Florida state Rep. Mike Miller in November's general election.

"In a series of tweets Monday morning, President Trump kicked off Labor Day by touting a falling unemployment rate and his administration’s recent trade negotiations -- while also taking pointed jabs at the public face of big labor.

Trump ripped AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka for his comments this weekend on “Fox News Sunday,” with the president saying it's ""easy to see"" why unions are doing ""so poorly"" under Democratic leadership.

""Richard Trumka, the head of the AFL-CIO, represented his union poorly on television this weekend,"" Trump tweeted. ""Some of the things he said were so [against] the working men and women of our country, and the success of the U.S. itself, that it is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly. A Dem!""

In his Sunday appearance on Fox News, Trumka did defend Trump at times, but the labor leader added “unfortunately, to date, the things that he has done to hurt workers outpace what he’s done to help workers.”

While Trumka acknowledged unemployment numbers are down, he added wages have also fallen and gas prices have risen since the first of the year.

“Overall, workers aren’t doing as well,” Trumka told Chris Wallace, saying he will most likely encourage AFL-CIO members to vote for Democrats in November’s midterm elections.

Trumka also slammed Trump’s firm stance on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, high-stakes talks in which Trump reportedly said he would not compromise with Canada.

Trumka said while his federation is anxious to have NAFTA reworked – calling the 1994 agreement “devastating” to American workers – any deal that only includes the U.S. and Mexico is unfeasible.

“Our economies are integrated,” Trumka said. “It’s hard to see how that would work without Canada on the deal.”

In another tweet on Monday, Trump said the United States has “tremendous” potential to fix some of the worst trade deals “ever made by any country in the world.”

""Happy Labor Day!"" Trump tweeted. ""Our country is doing better than ever before with unemployment setting record lows. The U.S. has tremendous upside potential as we go about fixing some of the worst Trade Deals ever made by any country in the world.""

""Big progress being made!"" Trump added.

The Labor Day tweet followed another from Saturday in which Trump warned Canada ""will be out"" of a revised NAFTA deal unless it's ""fair"" to the U.S., and threatened to simply scrap the current deal should Congress ""interfere"" with the negotiations.

""There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal,"" Trump said in one of a series of tweets as he visited his Virginia golf club during the weekend.

It's not clear, however, whether the Trump administration has the authority to strike a deal with just Mexico, as it announced Monday, and exclude Canada. Also, Congress must approve any rewrite of NAFTA, signed under President Bill Clinton, and might refuse to endorse a deal that leaves longtime ally Canada on the sidelines.

The 24-year-old NAFTA tore down most trade barriers dividing the U.S., Mexico and Canada, and trade between the three countries surged. But many manufacturers responded to the agreement by moving factories south of the border to take advantage of low Mexican wages, then shipping goods north to the United States and Canada.

Trump has charged the deal wiped out American factory jobs. He has pledged to negotiate a better deal or withdraw from NAFTA altogether. Talks on a new trade deal began a year ago, but got bogged down over U.S. demands, including some meant to return manufacturing to the United States.

A few weeks ago, the United States began negotiating with Mexico, leaving Canada on the sidelines. Outgoing Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto wanted to sign a deal before he left office Dec. 1. The deal announced Monday would, among many other things, require that 40 percent to 45 percent of a car be made in a North American country where auto workers made at least $16 an hour — that is, not in Mexico — before qualifying for duty-free status.

Talks to keep Canada in the trade bloc are to resume this week as Washington and Ottawa try to break a deadlock over issues such as Canada's dairy market and U.S. efforts to shield drug companies from generic competition.

""As we've said all week, we're working toward a modernized NAFTA that is good for the middle-class and people working hard to join it,"" said Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland. ""With good will and flexibility on all sides, a win-win-win outcome is achievable. Canada, of course, will only sign a deal which is good for Canada.""

"President Trump announced late Monday that he would head to West Virginia to campaign on behalf of the “hardworking and spectacular” Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who is hoping to flip the seat from Democratic challenger and incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin in the upcoming midterm elections.

Morrisey, who won the Republican primary, hopes to give the GOP a much-needed win in one of the top Senate battlegrounds as Democrats set the stage for a tough battle in November to regain control of the House.

“Will be going to the Great State of West Virginia on Tuesday Night to campaign & do a Rally Speech for a hard working and spectacular person, A.G. Patrick Morrisey, who is running for the U.S. Senate,” Trump tweeted. “Patrick has great Energy & Stamina-I need his VOTE to MAGA. Total Endorsement!""

Trump also reaffirmed his support of California’s GOP candidate for governor John Cox late Monday evening, who he says “will Make California Great Again.”

“I am hearing so many great things about the Republican Party’s California Gubernatorial Candidate, John Cox. He is a very successful businessman who is tired of high Taxes & Crime,” Trump tweeted.

Cox, who vowed to make the Golden State “livable and affordable” during an interview with Fox Business in June, will face Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the former San Francisco mayor, in the November general election.

Trump predicted earlier this month that Republicans could ride a “giant Red Wave” into the November midterm elections spurred on by none other than the president himself.

“As long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason), they will win! I LOVE the people, & they certainly seem to like the job I’m doing,” Trump tweeted. “If I find the time, in between China, Iran, the Economy and much more, which I must, we will have a giant Red Wave!”

Trump-backed Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach won the Republican primary for the state’s gubernatorial race, and candidates in three Missouri and Michigan races also won.

Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson, who also had the endorsement of the president, declared victory in Ohio's special election for a vacant House seat despite the race still being too close to call.

Democrats are widely seen as the favorites to reclaim control of the House, and are consistently leading in so-called “generic” congressional ballot polls – including districts that were once seen as solid red.

Despite coming up short in most of those races, Democratic leaders point out that the fact the races are competitive is a sign of Republican vulnerability in the fall.

"Maryland’s Obamacare insurers are asking for a 30 percent average rate increase for 2019, with some plans seeking hikes as high as 91 percent.

The proposals Monday come a few days after Virginia insurers also called for double-digit rate increases. Democrats have pounced on the rate hikes to say they are examples of how President Trump’s health policies are leading to high premiums.

Maryland Obamacare insurers CareFirst, BlueCross, and BlueShield plan to raise rates for an HMO plan on the law’s exchanges by 18 percent, and 91 percent for an extended network, or PPO, plan.

Kaiser Permanente, the state’s other Obamacare insurer, asked for a rate increase of 37 percent, according to a state filing.

The rates must be approved by the state and must be finalized before open enrollment starts Nov. 1.

The state’s insurance regulator said the rates don’t reflect legislation passed by the General Assembly to shore up the insurance exchange.

"A Democratic socialist candidate for New York state Senate whose biography was challenged in a recent expose is facing even more questions about her background -- as her family calls out claims about her supposedly hardscrabble upbringing.

Julia Salazar, a progressive Democrat affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America, has been touted as the next Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- who won a primary race against New York Rep. Joe Crowley. But her campaign was thrown into turmoil last month after an article in Tablet took issue with certain parts of her biography.

She had previously told multiple outlets she’s an immigrant from Colombia, saying her family came to the U.S. when she was young.

“My family immigrated to the U.S. from Colombia when I was a baby, and my mom ended up raising my brother and me as a single mom, without a college degree and from a working-class background,” Julia Salazar said in an interview with Jacobin Magazine.

SOCIALIST NY SENATE CANDIDATE CHALLENGED OVER CLAIMS OF BEING AN IMMIGRANT, JEWISH



But Tablet found she was actually born in Miami. She later said she had made it clear she was born in Miami. In that article, it also quoted her brother Alex as disputing her claims that she was Jewish. “There was nobody in our immediate family who was Jewish … we were not raised Jewish,” he said.

Since then, her brother and her mother have pushed back further against her claims, particularly her assertion that she was born into a ""working-class"" family and that her mother had no college degree.

In an interview with City & State, Alex Salazar said they were financially comfortable and living in a big house, with her father earning enough to set aside college funds of $6,000 per child.

“We were very much middle class. We had a house in Jupiter along the river, it was in a beautiful neighborhood,” Alex Salazar told the outlet. “I feel very strongly about my family and I want to tell the truth.”

He also disputed claims Salazar made that “Colombia is where my family was and where I was in the first years of my life.” He said that while there were a handful of trips to Colombia to visit family, they were raised entirely in Florida.

The candidate told City & State that the confusion stems from the expectation from others that all immigration stories fit into the same box.

“I understand now why this would be confusing, but I mentioned before I felt that we had a home in Colombia,” she said in the interview.

But it is far from the only biographical claim being disputed -- particularly, the claim by Salazar that “I was raised by a single mom who didn’t have a college degree.”

According to City & State, Christine Salazar, Julia’s mother, did graduate college when Julia was 8. The outlet noted that since her parents separated when she was 6, there were only two years she lived only with her mother before Christine graduated college.

Christine Salazar said that while there were lean times, such as when her ex-husband was laid off work, she also disputed a claim on her daughter’s campaign website that Julia’s job at a grocery store during high school was “to help make ends meet.”

“My kids always worked, from the time they were 14. I encouraged that because I thought there was a lot of value in that in terms of learning and responsibility so that was the purpose behind them having part-time jobs. … not the light bill,” she said.

Salazar is also facing questions about her progressive credentials after revelations that she was actually a conservative Christian activist on campus who worked on pro-Israel and pro-life initiatives.

In 2012, Salazar appeared on conservative personality Glenn Beck’s show, claiming “there are probably several” professors at the Columbia University who are “using the classroom as their podium to spread lies about the State of Israel, to delegitimize the State of Israel, and to spread propaganda to Columbia students.”

She has since come out against the Jewish state and supported organizations that campaign for boycott, disinvestment and sanctions against Israel.

"After a long battle with the Justice Department, key lawmakers probing alleged spying on members of President Trump's campaign and transition teams have secured permission to review key documents - papers so sensitive they can only be seen in a special facility called a ""SCIF.""

California Republican Devin Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, said his committee and the Department of Justice came to an agreement “that will provide the committee with access to all the documents and witnesses” requested.

To view the information, panel members and key staffers are expected to go to the main Justice Department office to view the documents within the next few days, a senior DOJ official told Fox News. Once there, they will be ushered into a SCIF, an acronym for Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility.

What is a SCIF?

A Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) is “a secure room or data center that guards against electronic surveillance and suppresses data leakage of sensitive security and military information,” according to SCIF Global Technologies, a company that builds SCIFs.

These secure rooms can prevent spies from entering undetected and stealing sensitive information.

What are they like?

SCIFs can be just like any other room, according to a 2015 National Journal report on the ones scattered around the Capitol complex.

“It’s just like any other room, but it takes a weight lifter to open the front door,” Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said then. “It’s similar to the Situation Room in the White House. It’s austere, but being in there you wouldn’t realize you’re in a SCIF.”

“It’s just like any other room, but it takes a weight lifter to open the front door.” - Rep. Peter King

Before reviewing material in the rooms, people must check their electronic devices with a guard stationed outside and punch in a code, former Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., said.

HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE TO GET LONG-SOUGHT DOCUMENTS FROM DOJ ON FUSION GPS, NUNES SAYS

The Department of Defense and Director of National Intelligence details the specifications of a SCIF – and the rooms aren’t cheap, National Journal reported. These rooms, which are built based on specific instructions, can cost anywhere from tens of thousands to tens of millions of dollars.

According to the National Journal, these rooms also have to be built by U.S. citizens who work for U.S.-based businesses that are accredited by the Defense Department or another security agency.

The rooms must be built so that passersby cannot hear ongoing conversations and people cannot force their way into them. SCIFs can be a room or even an entire building, National Journal reported.

"Karl Marx is being celebrated by Chinese President Xi Jinping as the “greatest thinker of modern times.” Western academics are celebrating Marx as a historic critic of the modern world.

Yet what all the pro-Marxist, pro-socialist speakers ignore is the human cost of Marxism.

In the name of Marx, Vladimir Lenin established the Soviet Union as police state that killed millions. Josef Stalin succeeded Lenin as the Soviet leader and proved even more ruthless and committed to killing.

Adolf Hitler led the National Socialist German Workers’ (Nazi) Party and socialism was central to his taking over the German economy and the German state – a fact the left makes every effort to avoid.

Mao Zedong was the deadliest Marxist of all and killed an uncounted number of millions to impose his will on China.

Fidel Castro turned a prosperous Cuba into a tragic police state in the name of Marxism-Leninism. And Venezuela has been shattered by socialism.

The academic left and its news media and Hollywood acolytes refuse to confront the horrifying record of Marxism’s endless inhumanity.

This would be a good year to begin educating all those who have been lied to as a result of the American academic infatuation with Marxism.

We need a TV series on Marxism (and its evolution through Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism, Castroism, etc.) so that Americans can come to grips with the horrors of centralized government and the cost of tyranny.

The desire of those with power to get more and more power seems insatiable.

Our Founding Fathers understood this and designed the Constitution to distribute power so no one person could establish a dictatorship. American exceptionalism is the opposite of Leninism.

Lenin used Marx’s analysis and rhetoric to justify establishing a secret police-controlled totalitarian system. Within a remarkably few years, he had centralized authority and begun to lock up, torture and kill his critics.

When Lenin died, Stalin took his system of centralized power and refined it with even more brutality. Literally millions were starved to death as a matter of policy to break the middle-class farmers.

As an example of the grip Marxism had on the American news media and intellectuals at the time, The New York Times reporter in Moscow conspired with other reporters to avoid covering the famine and the mass deaths. Diana West’s book “American Betrayal” cites the evidence of this deliberate coverup.

Left-wing American academics have always had a soft spot for Marxist regimes.

One of the most widely read economic textbook writers and the first American to win a Nobel Prize in economics, Paul Samuelson, told college students in the 1961 edition of his best-selling “Economics: An Introductory Analysis” textbook, that the Soviet Union’s economy was growing faster than the U.S. economy (never true).

This incorrect information continued to appear in subsequent editions of the textbook for more than two decades. Today the left argues that Marxism didn’t fail in the Soviet Union – only the way the Russians tried to implement it failed.

In fact, I was told by someone who was at a dinner with former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and a group of academics that when one of them made that argument Gorbachev responded: “You would have to be an American professor to believe that.”

Hitler studied the Lenin-Stalin police state and modeled much of his own totalitarianism on their design. There was a lot of the KGB in the design of the Gestapo. The central power of the state and its authority over people was central to Lenin, Stalin, Hitler and Mao. The individual human disappeared in the search for historic power and control.

We are about to witness a fascinating experiment in whether combining Marxism with big data can work. Xi Jinping is implementing a system by which Chinese people are heavily surveilled and assigned citizenship ratings based on their social media activity, patriotism, productivity, fitness routines and other behaviors. Those with low scores can be barred from commercial flights, some trains, and from having their children enrolled in some schools.

Deng Xiaoping saved the Chinese communists from popular rejection by advocating a system of free enterprise within the communist structure after Mao’s death. He argued that unless the Chinese economy was dramatically improved, China would not prosper. Further, he understood that if the system didn’t reward the Chinese people, there would be a widespread rejection of the Communist Party.

In his famous Southern Tour of China in January and February of 1992, Deng made the case for free markets in which productivity – not politics – decided winners and losers.

Now Xi Jinping is reversing the market-oriented decentralization of Deng. As he made clear in his recent speech on Marx (have your web browser translate it), he regards Marx – not 18th century Scottish economist Adam Smith – as the central guide for China’s future.

If indeed Marxism has defeated Deng Xiaoping in the corridors of Chinese power, we are in for a terrible experiment in tyranny. I wrote about President Xi Jinping’s aggressive power gathering in China, in my new book, “Trump’s America: The Truth About Our Nation’s Great Comeback.” I will doubtless write more on this in future columns, but for the moment, simply note that no experiment in Marxism has come out well.

Centralized control leads people to lie and cheat. Lying and cheating leads to the leadership demanding more secret police with more rules and more punishment. The system becomes a downward spiral in which humans are sacrificed to the power of the few.

This is Marx’s legacy. President Xi should study it carefully before taking China off the path of economic growth and onto the path of tyrannical growth.",world
"President Trump lashed out at Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a string of tweets on Monday, accusing him of hurting Republican chances in the upcoming midterm elections with a series of Justice Department investigations.

“Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department,” Trump tweeted. “Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff.....”

The president apparently was referring to the current investigations into GOP Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York. Fox News has reached out to the White House for additional clarification, and the Justice Department did not immediately respond.

Hunter and his wife, Margaret, were indicted last month on charges of illegally converting $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses and filing false records, while Collins was indicted earlier in August on insider-trading charges. Prosecutors pinpointed the alleged insider trading to June 2017, after Trump took office.

COLLINS, ACCUSED OF INSIDER TRADING, SAYS HE'LL STAY ON BALLOT FOR RE-ELECTION

Trump also tweeted: “The Democrats, none of whom voted for Jeff Sessions, must love him now. Same thing with Lyin’ James Comey. The Dems all hated him, wanted him out, thought he was disgusting - UNTIL I FIRED HIM! Immediately he became a wonderful man, a saint like figure in fact. Really sick!”

Monday’s tweets continued a long-running gripe Trump has had with Sessions ever since the attorney general recused himself last year from the Russia investigation. Last month, the president tweeted that Sessions ""doesn't understand what is happening underneath his command position"" and told ""Fox & Friends"" that his attorney general had ""never taken control of his department.""

The president also said the only reason he named Sessions to one of his most important Cabinet-level positions was the former Alabama senator's early support in the 2016 presidential election.

The comments prompted a pointed response from Sessions, who said in a statement that ""While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.""

In an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday, Trump said Sessions would remain in his job at least until the November midterm elections. The president did not elaborate on whether he would keep Sessions on as attorney general following the election.

"A nurse for aid group Doctors Without Borders launched a terror attack on Israeli troops near the Gaza border Monday, shooting and throwing an explosive device at soldiers before being shot dead, Israeli officials said.

Hani al-Majdalawi was killed during a gun battle with Israel Defense Forces as he tried to slip past a border fence and gain entrance to Israel.

No Israeli troops were injured in the incident, The Times of Israel reported.

“He who takes part in saving lives should assist in humanitarian activities in the Gaza Strip, and should not take part in terrorism,” Maj. Gen. Kamil Abu Rokon, the head of Israel Defense Ministry body COGAT, said in a statement. COGAT coordinates government activities with Palestinians.

Al-Majdalawi’s brother, Osama, wrote on Facebook that al-Majdalawi was recently married, expecting a child and not affiliated with any militant groups. Osama also noted, however, that his brother had purchased a rifle.

Doctors Without Borders confirmed al-Majdalawi had worked for the group and was killed by Israeli troops. But the group didn’t comment on why al-Majdalawi put down his medical kit and picked up a rifle, with a spokesperson telling the Associated Press the organization was still “working to verify and understand the circumstances regarding this extremely serious incident.”

"With all the focus on Russian hacking, Russian ambition, and Russian threats to U.S. national economic security, another Red Threat continues seemingly unabated: China’s ongoing effort to compete as a global economic power equal to, if not exceeding, the United States. China has the population and the economic ability to compete, and has made its ambitions crystal clear with its Made in China 2025 plans.

Part of the strategy is being played out now in the battle over tariffs and trade policy, but far more important to the U.S. innovation economy is the ongoing battle over forced technology transfers and Chinese efforts to steal U.S. intellectual property and control as much data online as possible.

Over the past decade, Chinese hackers have launched cyber-attacks, stealing data from the U.S. Congress, the U.S Department of Defense, and the federal Office of Personnel Management, one of the largest data breaches and thefts of American worker identities in history. The Chinese have run sustained cyber operations against our oil industry, critical infrastructure and utility industries, and the entertainment industry. With trade tensions running higher, China’s interest in hacking U.S. private businesses for data, trade secrets and intellectual property has only increased.

As noted by Wired magazine, Chinese government-backed hackers are also interested in so-called “command and control” opportunities in the U.S., everything from satellites and main frame computers to in-home laptops and security cameras. Yes, the Chinese are even interested in that nanny cam you may have in your nursery.

For some hackers, dealing with personal, in-home technology is a game to show what they can accomplish. But for other hackers, it’s an effort to find new ways to access personal information and find security holes that might allow them to launch far greater cyber-attacks from home networks.

If consumers start demanding up-front, full disclosure from retailers prior to purchase, they’d likely find consumers drawn to the devices that use the American based platforms, even if those devices cost a dollar or two more.

American consumers, while alarmed by such data breaches as the Yahoo email hack in which almost 3 billion consumers had personally identifiable information stolen, or the various retail chain hacks such as Target and Neiman Marcus, still tend to be lax about the security measures they use and fewer than 15 percent utilize security measures like password keepers to secure access to their important web sites and data like bank and investment accounts, health care information and access to their cloud storage, where they upload everything from legal documents, financial information and tax returns, to family photos, music and movies.

The cloud and the access the cloud can enable to home networks is increasingly where consumers should be concerned. Most probably aren’t asking where the data from their smart devices is going, or who has access to that data. Nor are they asking what the rules and regulations governing 3rd party access to that data are and where is it actually stored.

But they should be.

Most consumers are completely unaware that the smart devices, on which they’ve come to rely for everyday home convenience, transmit data back to a platform that is then stored on “the cloud.” When you go to Walmart or Target and buy a camera-enabled smart TV or a baby cam monitor, you don’t consider that the digital video feed might be transmitted to and stored in a cloud outside the United States and viewed by a hostile, foreign government like the Chinese.

But that is exactly what is happening.

Those smart, internet of things (IoT) devices, which numbered just over 8 billion in 2017, require platforms to “plug into” and a significant amount of those devices have agreements with platforms controlled by Chinese nationals with obvious ties to the Chinese government. That’s right, not kidding: the communist Chinese government may have access to your home via those smart devices.

This entire trend of the internet of things and smart devices is only going to accelerate: there are estimates that by 2020 there will be over 20 billion IoT devices, all plugged in to some platform somewhere. What retailers are not telling you is that those technological wonders likely rely on platforms and cloud storage controlled by Chinese nationals – sure it’s in the fine print on page 36 of the disclosures, but when was the last time you actually read all of the fine print? But if you did, would you still buy those phones and cameras that plug into certain platforms?

If consumers start demanding up-front, full disclosure from retailers prior to purchase, they’d likely find consumers drawn to the devices that use the American based platforms, even if those devices cost a dollar or two more. We can be assured that the Chinese are going to wage this cyber war. That doesn’t mean American consumers have to help them win.",world

"ISIS' main stronghold in Afghanistan was captured by U.S and Afghan Special Forces after a prolonged assault that killed nearly 170 terrorist fighters and resulted in no American deaths, military officials said Saturday.

The multi-staged military operation in Deh Bala, located on the border with Pakistan, began in April but wrapped up in June, military officials told Reuters.

No American or Afghan troops were killed during the offensive, which involved 600 Green Berets and three Afghan commando companies, according to Military.com.

""This area, two months ago, was controlled by [ISIS],"" Brig. Gen. John W. Brennan Jr., commander of NATO forces in eastern Afghanistan told Military.com. ""We pushed them into the mountains, so they cannot harm the people here.""

Troops initially arrived by helicopter and set up an operations base near the village of Gargari, where ISIS fighters were attempting to establish a regional capital. The district is next to Aachin, where the U.S. military dropped its largest non-nuclear combat weapon -- the MOAB -- to eradicate ISIS from its base in Afghanistan's Nanganhar province in April 2017.

“This was one of the main green zones that did two things. One, it provided money, finance, logistics to ISIS and we’ve taken that away from them,” Lt. Col. Josh Thiel from the U.S. First Special Forces Group told Reuters. “Additionally, ISIS was using this as a site to prepare and move high-profile attacks on Kabul and Jalalabad.”

U.S. and Afghan officials told the news outlet that troops found booby traps and the bodies of two beheaded women when they cleared the valley of terror fighters.

"House Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday publicly opposed the conservative-led bid to impeach Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, saying their accusations don’t rise to the necessary level of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

“I don’t think we should be cavalier with this process,” Ryan told reporters when asked about the newly introduced articles of impeachment.

The speaker’s comments splashed cold water on the impeachment push after the articles were filed Wednesday night -- though there were already signs conservatives were dialing back the push and want to use the threat more to pressure the Justice Department to produce documents pertaining to the Russia probe.

Sources told Fox News earlier Thursday that House Republicans were not planning to pursue the impeachment articles before the summer recess.

“Now this is in Rod Rosenstein’s court,” House Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said Thursday, while clarifying that a contempt resolution, rather than impeachment, would be their first course of action if they don't extract documents.

""My patience is running thin,"" he added.

A group of 11 House Republicans including Meadows had introduced five articles of impeachment against Rosenstein, who oversees the Russia probe, on Wednesday evening.

The articles accuse Rosenstein of intentionally withholding documents and overseeing the “potentially improper authorization” of surveillance against Trump associates.

It was not immediately clear whether the House would consider the resolution before lawmakers begin the August recess Thursday afternoon; the House will reconvene Sept. 4.

In an exclusive interview on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" on Wednesday night, Meadows had said it would be possible to push a so-called ""privileged"" resolution as early as Thursday morning, which would require a vote within two days.

But sources told Fox News there will be no such effort on Thursday, pushing off any consideration until the fall.

Fox News is told House GOP leaders huddled with Meadows and fellow Freedom Caucus leader Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio, and agreed that the best path is to continue to apply pressure on the DOJ to produce documents – keeping threats of contempt of Congress and impeachment resolutions on the table. The House has only initiated impeachment proceedings 62 times in the history of the country.

The resolution itself states it will be ""referred to the Committee,"" meaning the Judiciary Committee, for further review. That language alone had suggested the full House will not immediately consider the articles of impeachment.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., also told reporters Thursday he’d like to see the measure go through “regular order,” meaning through the committee, a process for which the Freedom Caucus often voices support.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, meanwhile, said Thursday that he has confidence in Rosenstein, and urged Congress to focus instead on immigration.

Justice Department officials maintain they have been responding to numerous document requests.

DOJ officials say the only document that Congress has specifically asked to see and been denied access to is the Aug. 2, 2017 “scope memo,” from Rosenstein to Special Counsel Robert Mueller regarding the scope of the Russia investigation. Officials say that’s because it is squarely within the confines of an ongoing probe.

GOP lawmakers cited that memo in the impeachment articles, criticizing Rosenstein for not providing a “less-redacted version” of the memo, even in a classified setting.

It’s unclear whether Republicans will resume this effort after the recess.

Both Meadows and Jordan told host Laura Ingraham the push was long overdue.

""For nine months, we've asked for documents, and that's all we want,"" Meadows said. ""Not only have subpoenas been ignored, but information has been hidden, efforts have been stonewalled.""

But Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted that the articles ""were filed in bad faith and show [the] extraordinary lengths to which House Republicans will go to protect [President] Trump.""

And Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the move was ""partisan nonsense.""

In one article of impeachment, Rosenstein is accused of improperly signing off on the FISA surveillance warrant application against ex-Trump aide Carter Page.

The application heavily relied on the infamous Steele dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the DNC and contained unverified, salacious allegations against Trump. The application also cited concerns about Page’s Russian contacts.

The articles also assert Rosenstein has a conflict of interest for signing off on the final Page surveillance warrant and not later recusing himself or recommending a second special counsel as some Republicans have sought.

According to a House Republican memo on that warrant released earlier this year, information about the dossier’s author and his anti-Trump bias was withheld from the national security court that approved the spying. After author and ex-British spy Christopher Steele was fired for lying to the FBI, he maintained contact with senior DOJ official Bruce Ohr, whose wife worked for Fusion GPS, the firm behind the dossier.

Rosenstein named Mueller to lead the Trump-Russia probe after Rosenstein’s boss, Sessions, recused himself from the investigation because of Sessions’ own role in the Trump campaign.

He has since clashed with House Republicans for months over requests for Department of Justice documents. GOP leaders grilled Rosenstein at a hearing in June for what they called his inadequate transparency.

In recent weeks, calls by top Republicans to remove Rosenstein grew louder. A simple majority of the House would suffice to impeach Rosenstein, but a two-thirds vote of the Senate would be required to remove him.

The move came about two hours after GOP lawmakers met with Justice Department officials who have been working to provide documents to several congressional committees about decisions made during the 2016 presidential campaign. The department has provided lawmakers with more than 800,000 documents, but Meadows said after the meeting that there was still ""frustration"" with how Justice has handled the oversight requests.

"Until President Trump nominated him for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court Monday night, most Americans had never heard of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Who is he, beyond his resume? What’s he really like? As someone who served as his law clerk from 2006 to 2007, I may be able to provide some answers.

During his 12 years on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Judge Kavanaugh has had many law clerks. It was my immense good fortune to be one of them.

Much has been said about Judge Kavanaugh’s brilliance, judicial temperament and commitment to the rule of law. As law clerks, we saw those qualities in action every day. But we also got to know the judge as a human being. As the confirmation process gets underway, I hope the Senate and the nation will too. They will like what they see.

For example, Judge Kavanaugh is a devoted husband and father of two girls. Back when I worked for him, he was a brand new dad. I still remember the judge beaming as he played hide-and-go-seek in chambers with his 1-year-old daughter, who would laugh and shriek with delight as he sang her name out loud while inching closer and closer to her hiding spot. Eleven years later, he continues to relish his role as a father.

Judge Kavanaugh is the author of almost 300 judicial opinions, sits on the nation’s most influential federal appeals court, and teaches a course on the separation of powers at Harvard. But somehow he finds time to coach both of his girls’ basketball teams.

Judge Kavanaugh is the author of almost 300 judicial opinions, sits on the nation’s most influential federal appeals court, and teaches a course on the separation of powers at Harvard. But somehow he finds time to coach both of his girls’ basketball teams.

The judge also goes out of his way to spend time with his clerks and to be a part of their lives. Frequent lunches with him are one of the many joys of the job. He travels the country to attend clerk weddings, and every year he invites his extended family of clerks to go see his beloved Washington Nationals baseball team.

At the end of the term, he treats his clerks to dinner to thank them and chat about their future goals. And he and his wife, Ashley, host an annual holiday dinner for all his past and present law clerks and their significant others at their home.

Of course, it wasn’t all fun and games. Clerking for Judge Kavanaugh was hard work. I remember he was toiling away on New Year’s Day and expected us to be there too. Late that afternoon, the judge walked over to where my co-clerks and I were working. He looked uncharacteristically sad. Then we found out why.

Judge Kavanaugh explained that his wife “called and said we all have to call it a day and go home.” I couldn’t help laughing. Like it or not, the judge was always candid in acknowledging – and gracious in following – controlling authority.

Still, we didn’t mind the long hours. We knew that Judge Kavanaugh worked harder – much harder – than anyone else, which inspired us to give it our all.

The judge brings the same boundless energy and enthusiasm to everything he does. He is a two-time Boston marathoner, and he has repeatedly earned the title of “fastest judge” in the ACLI Capital Challenge race. Even in chambers, he was hard to keep up with.

It has been 11 years since I left the judge’s chambers, and eight years since I’ve moved to Florida with my family. I still call him for guidance whenever I have to make an important decision. His response is always the same: He listens carefully, offers his own view, and then asks a simple but extraordinarily generous question: “How can I help?”

I can count on one hand the number of people in my life who regularly ask me that question and mean it. It is astonishing to me that one of them is a former boss who also happens to be one of the most distinguished judges in the country.

Over the years, Judge Kavanaugh has helped me and his other clerks in countless ways. Most of all, he has taught us what it means to be a good and decent man, who works tirelessly and strives for perfection, but still finds time for family, friends, and the things that really matter.

This is the Judge Kavanaugh I know and admire, and from whom I have learned so much. I was proud to work for him, and I hope the country will get to know that man as well.",politics
"Conservative artist Scott LoBaido is back at it.

Though a statue he created in support of President Trump was set on fire in August 2016, LoBaido has now created a new art installation that honors the president -- and shows support for him in the upcoming 2020 election.

"Tim Pawlenty -- who briefly ran for president in 2012 and had derided President Trump as ""unhinged"" -- was denied in his effort to stage a political comeback and become Minnesota’s governor again in the race to replace Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton.

County Commissioner Jeff Johnson won in Tuesday's Minnesota GOP gubernatorial primary despite Pawlenty's enormous fundraising and name recognition advantages. He also won despite his own history as the party's losing candidate for governor four years ago.

Pawlenty joins several other prominent Republicans -- including Reps. Martha Roby and Mark Sanford, as well as Sens. Jeff Flake and Bob Corker -- who have recently suffered major political consequences, at least in part, for opposing Trump.

Johnson had positioned himself as a more conservative candidate than Pawlenty. He branded the former two-term governor as part of the ""status quo"" and bashed him for calling Trump ""unhinged and unfit for the presidency"" in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election -- rhetoric that Pawlenty softened during the campaign.

Pawlenty was hoping to resurrect his political career after flaming out as a presidential candidate in 2011. He spent the intervening years as a Washington lobbyist.

KEITH ELLISON HANGS ON IN MINNESOTA DESPITE DOMESTIC ABUSE ALLEGATIONS

Democratic Rep. Tim Walz, meanwhile, won the party's three-way primary for the governorship, and will take on Johnson in November.

In all, voters in four states headed to the polls Tuesday to select nominees for critical gubernatorial, House, and Senate races in November, and several of the day's contests were broadly seen as an early indication of voters' views on Trump and the Republican Party.

In Connecticut, Madison businessman and political newcomer Bob Stefanowski won the Republican primary for governor, defeating four fellow GOP contenders and setting the stage for a pivotal battle with businessman Ned Lamont in November.

Connecticut is ground-zero for Republican efforts to continue their gains in progressive New England. Even though Connecticut voted for Hillary Clinton by double-digits in 2016, the state's governor, Dan Malloy, is deeply unpopular, with critics citing high taxes and an ongoing budget crisis. Malloy declined to seek a third term.

And in Wisconsin, Democrats making yet another effort to unseat Republican Scott Walker have nominated state schools chief Tony Evers. Evers emerged from a field of eight candidates in Tuesday's primary. He was the only candidate to have won election statewide before and now faces his biggest challenge against Walker, who has built up a huge financial advantage.

The 66-year-old Evers has been the state's education chief since 2009 and has clashed with Walker in the past on mostly education issues.Walker's campaign and Republicans criticized Evers for not revoking the license of a teacher who was caught viewing pornographic emails on his school computer.

Meanwhile, Christine Hallquist made history in Vermont Tuesday night as the first openly transgender nominee for a governorship from a major party in the nation's history, beating back her Democratic challengers in the state's primary.

Hallquist defeated educator Brenda Siegel, who earlier was considered a frontrunner in the race, and environmentalist James Ehlers.

Hallquist, a former CEO of the Vermont Electric Cooperative, made no bones about the fact she wanted a place in the history books during the campaign.

She's appealed to Vermonters with a progressive message including a livable wage, Medicare for all, free public college education and high-speed broadband access — even to those who live on remote back roads.

""That's how I want to be known in Vermont,"" Hallquist, 62, told The Associated Press in an interview at her Burlington offices. ""Nationally, I want to be known as the first trans candidate.""

Hallquist also defeated another candidate who was trying to make history: a 14-year-old boy, Ethan Sonneborn, who took advantage of the state constitution's lack of an age requirement to seek the governorship.

On the Republican side, first-term Gov. Phil Scott overcame businessman Keith Stern to win the GOP gubernatorial primary, surviving the major political fallout from his decision to sign the state's first major gun control laws earlier this year.

No sitting governor has been defeated in Vermont since 1962, and Scott's victory in November would continue Republicans' surprisingly strong hold on governorships in highly progressive New England. The GOP currently holds the governorships of four out of six states in the region, including Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.

However, Scott may have a unique vulnerability. In April, he was heckled by a bevy of protesters calling him a ""liar"" and ""traitor"" as he signed sweeping gun regulations into law, citing the dangers posed by mass shootings.

The package of bills raised the age to buy firearms from 18 to 21, banned high-capacity magazines, and made it easier to take guns from people considered a danger to themselves or others and from people arrested or cited for domestic assault.

Scott's approval rating in the state tanked after he signed the measure, plummeting from 65 percent early in the year to 47 percent shortly after the bill took effect. His disapproval rating nearly doubled to 42 percent in that period.

"President Trump's education secretary said Friday that she has ""no intention"" of taking action regarding any possible use of federal funds to arm teachers.

""Congress did not authorize me or the Department to make those decisions"" about arming teachers or training them on the use of firearms, Betsy DeVos said.

""I will not take any action that would expand or restrict the responsibilities and flexibilities granted to state and local education agencies by Congress,"" DeVos wrote in a letter to U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House committee overseeing education.

DeVos' comments came after a top official in her department, when asked about arming teachers, said states and local jurisdictions always ""had the flexibility"" to decide how to use federal education funds.

Frank Brogan, assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education, said arming educators ""is a good example of a profoundly personal decision on the part of a school or a school district or even a state.""

Democrats and education groups have argued, however, that the funds are intended for academics, not guns, adding that arming teachers is dangerous and could make schools feel like prisons.

It would be up to Congress, not the U.S. Department of Education, to place any restrictions or barriers to use those funds for purposes not currently in the law, a department spokeswoman said.

The debate arose earlier this month after a small rural school district in Oklahoma and the state of Texas asked the department to clarify what the funds can be used for.

""The position is: You have the language ... the language was written specifically to and always interpreted to mean 'This is your money,'"" Brogan said.

Democratic lawmakers and teachers blasted the idea, accusing the Trump administration of acting in the interests of the National Rifle Association, and several Congress members called for legislation that would prohibit the use of those funds for guns.

Debate over whether teachers should be allowed to carry weapons intensified after President Trump voiced support for the idea following a massacre at a high school in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 14 that left 17 people dead.

In the months since the shootings, DeVos has headed a panel on school safety that is supposed to issue a list of recommendations later this year, Politico reported.

BRENNAN FLOATS SUING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION; OTHER EX-CIA OFFICIALS WEIGH IN DURING PARADE OF SUNDAY INTERVIEWS

""My opinion is that he was politicizing intelligence,"" Bolton added, saying Brennan had failed to keep intact the ""wall of separation between intelligence and policy.""

Host Martha Raddatz ultimately challenged Bolton: ""You’re not sure whether John Brennan used classified information? You have no specific examples.""

Bolton replied, ""I think a number of people have commented that [Brennan] couldn’t be in the position he’s in of criticizing President Trump and his so-called collusion with Russia unless he did use classified information. But I don’t know the specifics.""

President Trump revoked Brennan's security clearance on Wednesday, saying he had politicized his security clearance and misled Congress about CIA spying in the Senate.

A larger review of who can retain security clearances after leaving the federal government may be warranted, Bolton added.

TRUMP HITS BRENNAN AS POLITICAL 'HACK' WHO CANNOT BE TRUSTED

""I think it's certainly appropriate in a time of unprecedented leaks of classified info,"" Bolton said. ""I don't see that there would be anything wrong if it were determined to go that way to review the policies about former officials having clearances. Sometimes it can be useful.”

Brennan had publicly accused President Trump of ""treason"" after his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin this summer in Helsinki, Finland, and he has repeatedly lambasted Trump with Twitter posts that critics have charged improperly hint at classified insider information about the ongoing Russia probe.

On Sunday, Brennan claimed on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that ""I don’t believe I’m being political at all.""

He also suggested he might take legal action against the president.

""If my clearances and my reputation as I’m being pulled through the mud now -- if that’s the price we’re going to pay to prevent Donald Trump from doing this against other people, to me it’s a small price to pay,"" Brennan said. ""I’m going to do whatever I can personally to try to prevent these abuses in the future, and if it means going to court, I will do that.""

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, a critic of Trump's decision to revoke Brennan's clearance, acknowledged that Brennan's unfettered comments had become an ""issue.""

""John and his rhetoric have become an issue in and of itself,"" Clapper said Sunday. ""John is sort of like a freight train, and he's going to say what’s on his mind.""

On CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" however, former CIA Director Leon Panetta claimed Trump may not have had the legal authority to terminate Brennan's clearance unilaterally.

“I think there are questions raised as to whether or not this president has followed the executive order, and whether or not he’s provided due process to those that are going to have their security clearances revoked,” Panetta said, referring to Executive Order 12968. The order establishes procedures for revoking security clearances.



Asked in the wide-ranging ABC interview about the threat of cyber-warfare ahead of the November elections, Bolton said the administration is monitoring threats from a variety of countries other than Russia.

""I can say definitively that it's a sufficient national security concern about Chinese, Iranian, and North Korean meddling,"" Bolton told Raddatz. ""I'm not going to get into what I’ve seen or haven't seen, but I’m telling you, looking at 2018 election, we are concerned about four countries.""

But Bolton said he plans to press his counterpart in Russia on the country's alleged election meddling in a meeting on Thursday.

""We'll keep raising it, and see what their response is,"" Bolton said. ""But it's not a question of just speaking with Russians. At the president's direction, we had a briefing with myself and four heads of deptartments, to lay out in nonclassified environment, what we're doing. That includes both defensive and offensive cyber operations to protect integrity of election process.""

Bolton said his meetings would also touch on Afghanistan, North Korea, Syria, and the Iran nuclear deal, which President Trump pulled out of earlier this year, leading to unrest and further economic decline there.

Bolton also told Raddatz that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be returning to Pyongyang ""soon"" for a fourth visit to engage in direct talks with North Korean leader Kim Jung-un. The White House's timeline for denuclearization is one year, Bolton said.

And the national security adviser said it would ""ultimately be the president’s decision"" whether to replace U.S. troops in Afghanistan with private military contractors.",politics
"Omarosa Manigault-Newman minces no words in a forthcoming tell-all about her White House days, reportedly going so far as to question President Trump's mental state.

The reality TV star's book, ""Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House,"" is set to hit the shelves later this month. In an excerpt obtained by DailyMail.com, she cites her former boss' interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt last year as a moment when she presumed ""something wasn't right.""

“While watching the interview I realized something real and serious was going on in Donald’s brain,” Omarosa reportedly writes. “His mental decline could not be denied. ... Many didn’t notice it as keenly as I did because I knew him way back when. They thought Trump was being Trump, off the cuff. But I knew something wasn’t right.”

Omarosa, who resigned in December 2017 as director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison, first met Trump in 2004 as a contestant on the first season of NBC’s “The Apprentice.” At the White House, Omarosa reportedly had a tense relationship with Chief of Staff John Kelly, who cracked down on her Oval Office access among other things.

She has previously spoken out against the White House since her departure, and her new book appears to follow in that track.

Regarding the Lester Holt interview, conducted after James Comey's firing, Omarosa reportedly writes that Trump “contradicted” himself on the reasons for the FBI director's ouster.

“Throughout this erratic and contradictory interview, I kept thinking, ‘Oh no! Oh no! This is bad! Donald rambled. He spoke gibberish. He contradicted himself from one sentence to the next,” she writes.

Omarosa is said to repeatedly criticize Trump in the book, despite their history from his reality TV days.

“Their relationship has spanned fifteen years—through four television shows, a presidential campaign, and a year by his side in the most chaotic, outrageous White House in history,” the publisher, Gallery Books, said in a statement to DailyMail.com. “But that relationship has come to a decisive and definitive end, and Omarosa is finally ready to share her side of the story in this explosive, jaw-dropping account.”

The publisher did not immediately respond to Fox News.

The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

But when allegations about the president's mental state were floated in the media earlier this year, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told ""Fox & Friends"" such claims were outrageous.

“It's absolutely outrageous to make these types of accusations and it's simply untrue, and it’s sad that people are going and making these desperate attempts to attack the president,” she said. “What I think is really mentally unstable is people that don't see the positive impact that this president is having on the country.”

The former “Apprentice” contestant drew press attention last year after she brought her 39-person bridal party inside the White House for an “extended” photo shoot in the Rose Garden. It is unclear whether she had permission. She was reportedly banned from posting any of the photos online by White House officials citing security and ethical concerns.

Upon her resignation, Trump tweeted wishing Omarosa ""continued success.""

"If you want to drain the swamp, you need to be able to fire the swamp.

President Trump, Congress and public employee unions (the defenders of the swamp) all know this. You need to know this because this Labor Day the battle over public funding of public employee union expenses and the ability to fire incompetent federal employees should matter to everyone.

Fortunately, the protection for the swamp is beginning to show cracks. For one, there is reason to believe that Congress will take steps to allow the rest of government to use the same expedited firing process that was overwhelmingly passed in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate in 2017 for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Astonishingly, a 2015 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, estimates that it takes a between 170 and 370 days to fire bad federal employees once the decision has been made to terminate their employment.

The sad fact is that many federal managers would prefer not to spend six months to a year in meetings trying to dislodge an entrenched do-nothing employee, so instead they just manage around unproductive employees. This allows federal employees who should be terminated to effectively shelter in place because it is too much of a pain to dislodge them.

The stories are so common that they hardly make news. One GS-12 public affairs specialist in the Atlanta Environmental Protection Agency office attempted to pawn a video camera she stole from the government – and kept her job.

A Department of Housing and Urban Development employee, according to Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., spent his day making real estate deals using his HUD email and kept his job six years after federal law enforcement reported the abuse to his superiors.

In the private sector, these employees would have had their boxes packed, their desk cleaned off, and their computer access eliminated faster than the 10 minutes it would take to fire them. But not in the federal government. That needs to change.

The primary obstacles to reform are the powerful public employee unions.

Not only do these unions dole out tens of millions of dollars in campaign cash, but, more significantly, they use their high-paying government positions to drag out these firings. And here is the kicker: you, the taxpayer, are paying most of their salaries, expenses, and travel costs to the tune of an estimated $177 million.

But help is on the way. President Trump issued three executive orders attempting to force public employee union representatives to work 75 percent of their time for the federal government and requiring unions to pay for their own office and travel expenses.

The Trump executive orders effectively cut the taxpayer subsidy to these unions by $100 million a year. The president also sought to shorten the appeals time for employee terminations, through the executive order process. While these reforms have been put on hold by an Obama appointee on the federal bench, Congress can act now.

As they return from their summer break, House members should immediately take up Rep. Loudermilk’s MERIT Act of 2017. Pass it and send it over to the Senate.

The House can also schedule a vote on legislation by Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., that ends taxpayer funding of union employees, forcing the labor unions to pay for their basic operating expenses using dues rather than expecting the rest of us to pay for their overhead.

Finally, the president could instruct the Office of Personnel Management to evaluate whether the federal government is required to collect union dues through payroll deductions or if that is a task better left to the unions, which are private entities. The simple act of forcing the federal public employee unions to collect their own dues would give federal workers true choice of whether to support a union or not.

This Labor Day, the swamp is still intact, but the walls that encase it are beginning to crumble. The first step to restore sanity to the federal workforce has to be for Congress to allow incompetent, lazy and recalcitrant employees to be fired – and fired now. It is time for this Congress to pass the MERIT Act.",politics
"President Donald Trump on Wednesday urged his supporters to sign a petition to pressure ESPN to show the national anthem during “Monday Night Football” broadcasts.

In an email sent on behalf of the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, Trump called the network’s announcement last week a “spineless surrender to the politically correct liberal mob.”

“Just after we heard a slitting governor trash America, ESPN has now decided it will no longer play the National Anthem before Monday Night Football,” the email read. “If ‘America’ is too offensive for anyone in our country, then what are they doing in America?’”

The email appears to reference New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s remark earlier this month during a bill signing, in which he declared, “We’re not going to make America great again. It was never that great.”

A spokesperson for Cuomo walked back the comments shortly after, saying “the Governor believes America is great and that her full greatness will be fully realized when every man, woman, and child has full equality.”

The Trump email concluded by saying, “I was the first person to sign this petition. Now I need you to follow my lead and be the second.”

Speaking to reporters during ESPN’s annual football media day, Jimmy Pitaro, the network’s president, said the national anthem would not be showed, before acknowledging, “there could be changes.”

“It’s somewhat unpredictable what’s going to happen in the world but as of now our plan now is to not broadcast the anthem. We have communicated that back to the NFL,” Pitaro said. “They have not asked but we proactively just as a courtesy and as good partners let them know what our plans are.”

Trump, who has been at the center of the national anthem controversy since former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the 2016-17 NFL season in opposition to police brutality, used his time on stage Tuesday night at a rally in West Virginia to condemn ESPN’s decision as “terrible.”

""While the players are kneeling ... you're all proudly standing for our national anthem,"" Trump told the crowd.

The NFL announced in May that teams and league personnel who do not “stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem” would be fined. However, the policy was put on hold as the league and its players association negotiated the strategy.

ESPN did not air the national anthem during last season’s ""Monday Night Football"" broadcasts, a similar approach that CBS has taken in the past and plans to do so this season, according to the USA Today Sports. FOX plans to only show the anthem during “special broadcasts” such as Veteran’s Day or Thanksgiving and during the playoffs, while NBC Sports broadcasts plans are still undetermined.

"WASHINGTON -- When it comes to the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama administration increasingly appears to have been a bottomless pit of deception.

First, President Barack Obama failed to disclose to Congress the existence of secret side deals on inspections when he transmitted the nuclear accord to Capitol Hill. (They were only uncovered by chance when then-Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., learned about them during a meeting with International Atomic Energy Agency officials in Vienna.) Then, we learned that the Obama administration had secretly sent a plane to Tehran loaded with $400 million in Swiss francs, euros and other currencies on the same day Iran released four American hostages, which was followed by two more secret flights carrying another $1.3 billion in cash.

Now, in a bombshell revelation, Republicans on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, led by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, have revealed in a new report that the Obama administration secretly tried to help Iran use U.S. banks to convert $5.7 billion in Iranian assets, after promising Congress that Iran would not get access to the U.S. financial system -- and then lied to Congress about what it had done. (Full disclosure: My wife works for Portman).

In July 2015, Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew assured the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that, under the nuclear accord, Iran ""will continue to be denied access to the [U.S.] financial and commercial market"" and that ""Iranian banks will not be able to clear U.S. dollars through New York, hold correspondent account relationships with U.S. financial institutions, or enter into financing arrangements with U.S. banks."" A few weeks later, one of Lew's top deputies, Adam Szubin, used the exact same words in testimony to the Senate banking committee.

But Senate investigators found that on Feb. 24, 2016, the Obama Treasury Department ""granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system"" -- exactly what Lew and Szubin said would not happen -- including unlimited future Iranian deposits at Bank Muscat in Oman until the license expired.

Not only that, Senate investigators found that officials from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which regulates U.S. banks' compliance with U.S. sanctions law, ""encouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds."" The report says ""both banks declined to complete the transaction due to compliance, reputational, and legal risks associated with doing business with Iran.""

Then, after issuing the license, the Obama administration explicitly denied to Congress that it had done so. Lew and Szubin both failed to disclose the license in congressional testimony while continuing to assert that the Obama administration would not give Iran access to U.S. financial institutions -- when they had just tried to do so. And in a June 2016 letter to Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Mark Kirk, R-Ill., Treasury officials declared ""The U.S. Department of Treasury is not working on behalf of Iran to enable Iranian access to U.S. dollars elsewhere in the international financial system, nor are we assisting Iran in gaining access to dollar payment systems outside the U.S. financial system. The Administration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system."" This was patently false.

Investigators also found internal State Department emails, in which officials admitted that the Obama administration had ""exceeded our JCPOA commitments"" by authorizing Iranian access to U.S. banks. Furthermore, the report reveals that the Obama administration put on more than 200 ""roadshows"" across the world where they encouraged foreign financial institutions to do business with Iran ""as long as the rest of the world left the United States out of it."" According to the report, during a roadshow in London, OFAC Director John Smith ""downplayed the likelihood of any future penalties or fines,"" telling the audience ""that 95 percent of the time OFAC sees an apparent violation it results in a simple warning letter or no enforcement action.""

In other words, the Obama administration: (1) told Congress it would not allow Iran access to U.S. financial institutions; (2) issued a special license allowing Iran to do exactly that; (3) unsuccessfully pressured U.S. banks to help Iran; (4) lied to Congress and the American people about what it had done; (5) admitted in internal emails that these efforts ""exceeded"" U.S. obligations under the nuclear deal; (6) sent officials, including bank regulators, around the world to urge foreign financial institutions to do business with Iran; and (7) promised that they would get nothing more than a slap on the wrist for violating U.S. sanctions.

How bad is this? Remove the words ""Obama"" and ""Iran"" and replace them with ""Trump"" and ""Russia"" and imagine the outrage that would ensue over the same revelations. Democrats would be holding news conferences, and the story would be front-page news.

We hear a lot these days from the media about the danger of presidential lies. Well, when it comes to the Iran deal, the Obama administration took lying to new heights. And no, that's not Fake News.",politics
"President Trump on Monday said he plans to terminate the existing North American Free Trade Agreement, as he announced a new tentative agreement between the United States and Mexico that he described as ""one of the largest trade deals ever made.""

""I'll be terminating the existing deal and going into this deal,"" the president said in the Oval Office, calling it a ""big day for trade.""

But the president said Monday “we’ll see” if Canada can still be part of the trade pact, leaving open the possibility of separate agreements.

""We are starting negotiations with Canada pretty much immediately,"" Trump said.

Trump, sitting at the Resolute Desk, put Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on his speaker phone as the press watched in the Oval Office. The Mexican president, speaking through a translator, congratulated the negotiators on both sides and expressed hope the United States and Canada would come to an agreement.

Later, the White House said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau congratulated Trump. ""The leaders discussed US - Canada trade and agreed to continue productive conversations,"" White House officials said.

Earlier in the day, Trump said he wanted to get rid of the name “NAFTA” because it has bad connotations. He said he planned to call the deal the ""United States-Mexico Trade Agreement"" instead.

The United States Trade Representative called the U.S.-Mexico deal a “preliminary agreement in principle, subject to finalization and implementation.”

“They used to call it NAFTA, we are going to call it the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement, and we will get rid of the name NAFTA,” Trump said. “It has a bad connotation because the United States was hurt very badly by NAFTA.”

Trump on Monday called it ""one of the largest trade deals ever made."" The U.S. and Mexico have been working to resolve key differences on issues ranging from automobiles to energy.

According to a fact sheet from the United States Trade Representative, the agreement includes new rules of origin to incentivize manufacturers to source goods and materials in North America – including requiring 75 percent of auto content be made in the United States and Mexico.

Officials in Canada, though, on Monday still expressed optimism over a deal.

“Canada is encouraged by the continued optimism shown by our negotiating partners,” a spokesman for Canada's minister of foreign affair, Chrystia Freeland, said Monday. “Progress between Mexico and the United States is a necessary requirement for any renewed NAFTA agreement.”

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump often railed against the trade pact as “the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere.”

Trump and Peña Nieto have been working for the past five weeks to iron out their bilateral differences so Canada can rejoin the talks to update NAFTA. The U.S. and Mexico wanted to finalize an agreement this month so that it can be signed ahead of Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s inauguration in December.

One of the biggest issues on the negotiating table deals with car manufacturing jobs, as the Trump administration pushes for a deal that would boost factory employment in the U.S.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Mexican Secretary of Economy Idelfonso Guajardo were seen walked together Monday into the White House without talking to reporters. The delegation also included Jesus Seade, a World Trade Organization veteran tapped by Lopez Obrador as his future chief trade negotiator.

The U.S. on Thursday agreed to keep the 2.5 percent tariff currently applied under World Trade Organization rules if the cars are made at factories that already exist, which leaves open the possibility that automobiles that are built at new plants could face tariffs of 20 percent to 25 percent.

Trump has also signaled that he is open to negotiating trade deals with Mexico and Canada separately, while both countries have said they want to keep the three-nation trade deal that dates back to 1994.

Earlier in August, Trump threatened Canada with auto tariffs if the U.S. and Canada can't forge a deal.

""Canada must wait,"" Trump tweeted. ""Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high. Will tax cars if we can't make a deal!""

Canada responded with a statement Friday night, saying: ""Our focus is unchanged. We'll keep standing up for Canadian interests as we work toward a modernized trilateral NAFTA agreement.""

Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canada's foreign minister, added: ""We're glad Mexico and the U.S. continue to work out their bilateral issues. It's the only way we'll get to a deal.""

"The Manhattan district attorney’s office in New York City may push for criminal charges against the Trump Organization and two senior officials at the company over hush money that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen paid to an adult-film actress, according to a report.

Investigators led by District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. would look at how the company accounted for its reimbursement to Cohen for the $130,000 he paid to Stormy Daniels, who claims to have had an affair with President Trump, the New York Times reported.

Two officials with knowledge of the matter told the Times that the possible action was still in its early stages and no decision has been made on whether the state investigators will go after the Trump Organization.

The organization reportedly recorded the reimbursements to Cohen as a legal expense, but the former Trump attorney admitted Tuesday that he used the money to ensure the adult-film actress didn’t reveal the affair she allededly had with then-candidate Trump during the 2016 presidential election.

According to prosecutors, the reimbursement payments were phony legal invoices that were connected to a nonexistent retainer agreement. Cohen reportedly issued sham monthly invoices for $35,000 in “pursuant to retainer agreement.”

The former Trump attorney, who pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges, didn’t actually do any legal work concerning the issue.

“On its face, it certainly would be problematic,” one official familiar with the district attorney’s office review told the Times, adding that such reimbursement scheme could be considered a felony under state law.

Prosecutors in the district attorney’s office, who reviewed the court papers about the campaign finance charges and other federal crimes to which Cohen pleaded guilty, are now focused on determining whether business records were falsified, according to the Times.

If they were, this could lead to low-level felony or misdemeanor charges as it’s illegal to willfully make a false entry in a business record with intent to deceive. It’s a felony if the false record was made in an attempt to conceal or commit another crime.

But a state investigation is likely to face obstacles and delays due to other open inquiries related to Trump and his associates, including the federal investigation into Cohen, the probe by the special counsel Robert Mueller, and a lawsuit that the state attorney general brought against the Trump Foundation.",politics
"Alice Marie Johnson, the woman whose life sentence was commuted by President Trump this week, promised the commander in chief: “I will make you proud.”

Johnson, 63, had been serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole after she was convicted of a first-time nonviolent drug offense and charges related to money laundering. Reality TV icon Kim Kardashian West took up her case, even meeting with Trump at the White House to plead for clemency.

In an interview Thursday night with Fox News’ Martha MacCallum on “The Story,” Johnson expressed her gratitude for Trump's decision the day before to commute her sentence.

“Thank you so much President Trump for taking the time to look at my case and to really look at me,” she said. “I promise you President Trump, I will make you proud that you gave me that second chance.”

Johnson spent 22 years in prison, a third of her life, and said that it was her faith and her optimism that allowed her to carry on.

“The only way that I was able to make it through that time, and this is the truth, was my faith in God.”

She said she knew that one day, “He was going to bring me out.”

Johnson continued, “I lived my life with an eye toward one day walking out of those doors a free woman and the day that I got the news that President Trump had granted my clemency and given me a second chance at life was the best day of my life.”

The events leading up to Johnson's offenses included divorce and the loss of her job at Fedex. It was desperation that forced her hand.

“Don’t make a permanent decision that can change your life forever based on a temporary situation,” she said looking back at her past. “It was not worth it… It changed the course of my life.”

Johnson said that now that she’s free, she wants to fight hard for prison reform, including making sure people incarcerated are ready to rejoin society when their “miracle” does come.

Johnson said that it’s finally “starting to set in that I’m truly free.”

She revealed, “I’m so happy, nothing bothers me.”

"Primaries Tuesday showed the power of President Trump’s endorsements continued to help Republican candidates triumph, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., lost a key lieutenant – Rep. Joe Crowley – in a New York City race that suggests internal divisions among Democrats are more serious than people might think.

In addition, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee who lost to President Obama, staged a political comeback by easily winning the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat in Utah held by the retiring Republican Orrin Hatch. Romney seems headed for victory in November in the heavily Republican state.

Democratic divisions between the leftist insurgents who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in his unsuccessful campaign against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 make it less likely that a big, blue wave is coming that will sweep Democrats to majority control in the House and Senate.

The insurgents have the potential to change the Democratic Party over the long term into something more in line with left-leaning parties in Europe, rather than continuing to remain within the uniquely American spectrum where both parties agree to one degree or another that market forces should continue to play a role in setting economic policy.

President Trump’s job approval numbers are holding steady somewhere in the mid-40s. The percentage of voters who feel the country is on the right track is now up near 40 percent – double where it was at the beginning of the year.

The only way this feels like it’s a “change election” is on the Democratic side, where younger voters and women seemed determined to “Bernie-fy” the party and have it stand for such things as rolling back the Trump tax cuts, free college for all, Medicare for all and – in essence – a transformation of the United States into a full-blown version of a European-style welfare state.

That pitch might work in the big cities, which seem to be the only power base the party of the Clintons and Obama has left. But it’s not clear that voters in the suburbs and rural areas will vote for candidates on the far left.

And, thanks to the recent outburst from liberal entertainers and U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters – who has urged those on the left to harass Trump administration officials wherever they might be found – the Democrats may be in the process of losing whatever advantage they might have had on the civility question. That might actually be one place where President Trump is truly vulnerable.

In New York City, voters in 56-year-old Democratic Rep. Crowley’s Queens congressional district tossed him out in favor Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old former Bernie Sanders organizer. Ocasio-Cortez represents both a generational and ideological shift in one of the city’s more moderate boroughs.

The defeat of Crowley, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and a potential successor to Pelosi, suggests the divisions between the older liberals currently running the party and young insurgents who transferred their allegiance from President Obama to Bernie Sanders in 2016 may be deeper and more permanent that many analysts believed. That spells bad news for Democrats in the November election.

In addition to the surprise defeat of Crowley in New York, a closely watched race in the state saw the winner of a House Republican primary on New York City’s Staten Island helped by an endorsement from President Trump. Rep. Dan Donovan, who had the president’s backing, defeated former GOP Rep. Michael Grimm. Grimm’s campaign – claiming his conviction on tax fraud charges that forced his resignation from Congress was the result of a kind of “deep state” conspiracy – proved unpersuasive.

In New York’s 24th Congressional District near Syracuse, Democrats nominated Syracuse University Professor Dana Balter as their candidate against Republican Rep. John Katko. While New York Republicans are thought to be an endangered species, Katko – who won re-election to second term in 2016 with 61 percent of the vote – is the only one occupying a district carried by Hillary Clinton in the presidential electioni.

Romney’s nomination is interesting, as pundits – at least those on the GOP side – say he’s running to become the voice of opposition to Trump from within the party. That would mean taking over the role now played by Arizona Republican Senators Jeff Flake, who is retiring after a single term, and John McCain, who battling brain cancer.

Even if that’s true, that’s a dubious proposition. Romney was never as intrinsically popular among Republicans who supported him as Trump is among his supporters.

Any love the Republican rank and file felt for Romney was based on his winning the nomination to go up against President Obama, whom Republicans greatly desired to see beaten.

The former Massachusetts governor may think he has some kind of moral authority that can act as a temporizer to President Trump’s excesses, but that’s only if his audience is the New York Times, CNN and the rich elites who accepted him as one of their own in a way they will never accept Trump.

SOUTH CAROLINA

Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, who was endorsed by President Trump, turned back a challenge from businessman and first-time candidate John Warren to win the GOP nomination for governor in a runoff.

McMaster – who was lieutenant governor until he replaced Gov. Nikki Haley when she became America’s U.N. ambassador – was one of the first statewide elected officials anywhere in America to endorse Donald Trump for president. The president repaid the favor by traveling to the state for a last-minute “get out the vote” rally for McMaster Monday night.

MARYLAND

In Maryland, former NAACP President Ben Jealous defeated Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker and will face GOP Gov. Larry Hogan in the fall. Jealous promised to run a Sanders-like campaign against the popular Hogan, who the polls indicate is an early favorite for re-election. This makes him something of a rarity in the heavily Democratic state.

In the contest for U.S. Senate in Maryland, incumbent Democrat Ben Cardin easily won re-nomination against six opponents, including Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army solider convicted of leaking sensitive information and later pardoned by President Obama after serving seven years of a 35-year sentence.

MISSISSIPPI

In Mississippi, Democrat David Baria emerged from the runoff as the winner for the right to take on Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker in the November election in something akin to a quixotic challenge.

In the state’s 3rd Congressional District, Republican Michael Guest defeated Whit Hughes in the runoff for the seat held by retiring GOP U.S. Rep. Greg Harper.

COLORADO

In Colorado, progressive Democratic multi-millionaire Jared Polis and Republican Walker Stapleton, a member of the Bush political dynasty, will face off against one another in the race for governor.

In the race for Polis’ open congressional seat the Democrats nominated attorney Joe Neguse, whose campaign relied heavily on his life story – he is the son of African refugees – to make a personal connection with voters.

In the state’s 6th Congressional District, conservative GOP Rep. Doug Lamborn beat back four challengers to win renomination for a seventh term representing the residents of Colorado Springs and its environs.

OKLAHOMA

In Oklahoma, Republican former Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett and former state Attorney General Drew Edmondson emerged from a multi-candidate field to win their respective party nominations for governor.

In the heavily Republican 1st Congressional District in Tulsa, the GOP’s Tim Harris won the nomination in the race to follow former Rep. Jim Bridenstine, now the NASA administrator, into Congress.

Overall, the primaries Tuesday saw few surprises – with the exception of Crowley’s stunning upset – and saw no clear trends emerging save for the continued popularity of President Trump among Republicans in Republican areas.",politics
"The Obama administration granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians, including family members of government officials, while negotiating the Iran nuclear deal, a senior cleric and member of parliament has claimed.

Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, who is chairman of Iran’s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee, made the allegations during an interview with the country’s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country’s Fars News agency.

He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.

He claimed that the deal was made during negotiations for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was reached in July 2015. President Trump announced in May that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement.



OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ALLEGEDLY GAVE IRAN ACCESS TO US FINANCIAL SYSTEM

“When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,” he claimed.

“If today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.”

The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s inner circle, added: “It should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.”



SUPREME COURT TRUMP TRAVEL BAN DECISION IS AN IMPORTANT VICTORY FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY

He estimated that between 30 and 60 were studying in the U.S. while the rest of them were working in the country “against our national interests.”

Though Zolnour did not mention anyone by name during the interview, several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father Hossein Fereydoun is the brother of and special aide to Rouhani; and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.

There is no suggestion either of these people received citizenship in the wake of the Iranian nuclear deal. It’s also unclear if Zolnour meant citizenship or a green card.

In 2015, 13,114 people born in Iran were issued green cards, while 13,298 were issued one in 2016, according to figures from the Department for Homeland Security. In 2015, 10,344 Iranians became naturalized, with a further 9,507 in 2016.

Asked about the cleric's claim, a State Department spokesperson said: “We’re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.”

Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official’s allegation. “This sounds like totally made up BS,” she said.

The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.

The cleric's claim could, in the U.S., fuel Republican complaints about the concessions made by the Obama administration during that period -- including not just sanctions relief, but the $1.7 billion payment supposedly tied to a legal settlement that coincided with the 2016 release of American prisoners.

And in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran's elite.

“Many ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. “The regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.”

Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: “Iranians don't understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran. That is why many Iranians on social media have been urging the U.S. government to deport the children of the regime officials.”

Iran is one of seven countries included in Trump's travel ban, upheld last week by the Supreme Court.

The country has been beset by a series of economic protests in recent days as the country’s currency, the rial, crashes.

Since the U.S. withdrew from the Iranian nuclear deal on May 8, the value of the rial has plunged to 90,000 against the dollar – double the government rate of 42,000 rials to the dollar.

The protests have hit Iranian commercial areas, including the historic Grand Bazaar in Tehran, the home of conservative merchants who backed the 1979 Islamic Revolution and overthrow of the Shah.

Rouhani has warned the country that it faces an “economic war” with the U.S., but analysts have warned that hard-liners are likely behind the protests seeking to challenge the more moderate president.

Rouhani is under pressure since the nuclear deal agreed with the Obama administration was torn up by Trump. As a result, international firms and oil companies have backed away from billion-dollar deals with the Islamic republic.

"President Trump is slated to provide written answers under oath later this month in a defamation lawsuit brought by a former “Apprentice” contestant, a Friday court filing said.

The defendant, Summer Zervos, filed the defamation lawsuit in early 2017 after Trump called her a liar for claiming he groped and forcibly kissed her at a hotel in 2007. Trump has denied the claims.

Zervos, who owns a restaurant in California, said Trump’s denial has hurt her credibility and ability to make a living.

Trump’s lawyers agreed to exchange “written answers and objections” to formal questions no later than Sept. 28, the Washington Post reported, citing the document that was filed with the New York State Supreme Court.

Providing false answers after being sworn would open the president to perjury charges. Trump’s lawyers have unsuccessfully tried to circumvent the stipulation several times this year, the Post reported.

Mariann Wang, Zervos’ lawyer, declined the Post’s request to comment on the agreement. Marc Kasowitz, President Trump’s lawyer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, according to the paper.

An Aug. 29 letter released Friday indicated Wang had written to Judge Jennifer G. Schecter saying that Trump’s lawyers and the Trump Organization were blocking her document requests, the Post reported.

“There can be no question here that Defendant has the practical ability — and indeed, the obligation — to have directed the preservation and collection of responsive documents at the Trump Organization,” Wang reportedly wrote.

Zervos’s case is one of several pending against the president. Adult-film star Stormy Daniels, whose case has been more highly publicized, is trying to invalidate a 2016 nondisclosure agreement that prevents her from speaking about a supposed sexually relationship with the president 12 years ago.

But Daniels’ case has been delayed as federal authorities investigate Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty last month to violating federal campaign finance laws when he paid Daniels “hush money” to keep quiet about the alleged affair.",politics
"Four men were arrested in connection with an apparent acid attack on a 3-year-old boy that occurred at a busy store in England on Saturday, police said.

Three men, ages 22, 25 and 26, were being questioned in London on suspicion of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, West Mercia police said Monday. A 39-year-old suspect was arrested Sunday.

The attack took place around 2:15 p.m. at Home Bargains, a discount retail store in Worcester.

“At this time we are treating this as a deliberate attack on a 3-year-old boy,” West Mercia Police Chief Superintendent Mark Travis said in a statement. “The incident will rightly shock the local community and I would like to reassure local people that we are carrying out a thorough investigation to identify those responsible.”

Police said the boy was treated at the hospital for serious burns to his arms and face, and was later released. Authorities said the long-term medical implications for the child are unknown, but they hope he will not suffer life-changing injuries.

“It's an awful incident and we're really, really concerned about this,” Travis told Sky News.

Worcester City Council leader Marc Bayliss described the attack as “absolutely pure evil,” and urged anyone with information to come forward.

“Think if this was a member of your family, an innocent child, a 3-year-old probably scarred or damaged for life by this,” he told Sky News. “We need to bring the perpetrators to justice, and quickly.”

"Knowing Kate Steinle’s name has been painful enough. We know of her because she was killed by a criminal illegal alien in 2015. We now know Mollie Tibbetts’ name, murdered last month, and an illegal alien has been arrested for that crime as well.

For many who did not originally support Donald Trump for president, a turning point for us was the existential danger of our open southern border. In Trump, it became clear we had a candidate who understood and was serious about dealing with the disaster of our southern border. Being blunt about the criminals enjoying the open door into our nation, liberals and the establishment gave us our first taste of the hysteria about President Trump that would come to consume them.

And then in July of 2015, Kate Steinle was shot to death by a criminal illegal alien who had been put back onto the street through San Francisco’s sanctuary policy. If they had just turned Kate’s killer over to ICE when they wanted him, she would be alive today. A San Francisco jury inexplicably found him not guilty of both murder and manslaughter. They did find him guilty of a lesser charge of being a felon in possession of a gun.

Now we know Mollie Tibbetts’ name. Hers is a horror story of a college student going out for a jog in her small Iowa town. She was found dead in a cornfield, and authorities arrested a man who the police say confessed to stalking her, but then “blacked out” during the time he allegedly murdered her. He thought to look in his trunk, found her dead body, and then buried her in the field.

He, too, is an illegal alien, living in that Iowa town for at least 4 years, perhaps as many as 7. Law enforcement doesn’t really know.

Mollie is another of so many in this country, who were victimized and harmed by people who should never have been here. Sure, there’s danger everywhere, and yet there is a simple fact: The horror of Mollie’s last moments leading to her death would not have happened had her alleged killer not been in this country.

For perspective, ‘For America,’ the grassroots conservative action group, reminded us by tweeting the toll exacted on too many families in our country: “Mollie Tibbetts, Kate Steinle,, Tessa Tranchant Dominic Durden, Grant Ronnenbeck, Jamica Williams, Kevin Will, Nabra Hassanen, Jamiel Shaw, Jose Chavez, Lauren Bump, Sarah Root, Edwin Jackson … and thousands more. None of their killers should have been in this country.”

Liberals are already refusing to acknowledge the truth of the matter. CNN must have been in a tizzy trying to figure out how to report, but not report, the story and decided on this nonsense for a headline: “Man arrested in connection with disappearance of Mollie Tibbetts.” They couldn’t even be honest about her death. No wonder CNN is being beaten in the ratings by “Ancient Aliens.”

Media bias presenting opinion as “news” is bad enough. Gossip masquerading as “news” is rightly called out as “fake news.” But even worse is the increasing penchant by the legacy media to hide facts by not reporting them at all.

For years we watched as the Republican establishment obsessed about passing “comprehensive immigration reform” consisting primarily of amnesty while offering up a vague gesture about “securing the border.”

That was a regular promise never kept, as illegal immigration increased and criminal gangs, like MS-13, continued to devastate our communities.

Candidate Trump, indicated a sea change for Americans who were constantly being lied to by a condescending establishment and their helpmate media, that was never serious about the chaos brought to our communities by millions of illegal aliens.

Some might even say the swamp preferred chaos in society, as it might keep people distracted enough from noticing the increasing politicized corruption eating away at our government, most apparently at the so-called Justice Department.

After the arrest of Mollie’s alleged murderer, an MSNBC guest referred to her as “some girl in Iowa” being talked about on Fox News while implying Fox News wasn’t covering the Manafort and Cohen stories. NewsBusters reported, “Both legal stories dominated Fox News Channel programming on Tuesday with multiple segments every hour, but that didn’t stop Greer from making that sweeping generalization and trivializing the death of a young college student allegedly at the hands of an illegal alien from Mexico.”

Mollie’s murder is a reminder about why Donald Trump is president — Americans are committed to their families, and the future. We know there are no guarantees, but we want to be as safe as possible and expect the government to act on that. We are also tired of being patronized by an increasingly out-of-touch and smug media, and having our concerns dismissed by ignorant know-it-alls in government.

Americans stand with Kate and Mollie and everyone who has, and will, face violence that is directly and specifically preventable by securing our border and reforming our immigration policy. It’s time to send another message that our deadly status quo on immigration must change.

Each morning, Erol Baytas checks for further damage on the imposing but derelict timber building on an island off Istanbul that for decades housed orphans from the minority Greek community.

The scene on the hilltop on the island of Buyukada, the largest of the nine Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara, looks more like the shattered remains of a horror movie set than the majestic hotel and casino complex that it was originally intended to be. Parts of the roof have caved in, wooden panels are missing and the kitchen stoves have rusted.

It's quite a fall from grace for the 120-year-old building.

""Every day, a piece of the building falls out,"" laments Baytas, the building's 56-year-old caretaker.

""When it is raining, I go inside to survey the extent of the damage. Water will flow through every hole and it hurts me so much. I call them the building's tears. I get emotional because it is my home, and before me it was the home of thousands of children.""

The building over six floors was originally designed by architect Alexandre Vallaury for the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, the company which also ran the famed Orient Express. But when it was built in 1899, Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II withheld his permission for it to operate as a hotel and casino.

The wife of a Greek banker later purchased it and donated it to the Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which then ran it as an orphanage.

The Prinkipo orphanage became home for about 5,800 minority Greek children from 1903 until 1964 when it was forced to shut down, a victim of political tensions between Turkey and Greece over the east Mediterranean island of Cyprus.

The building later became the subject of a drawn-out legal battle between the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Turkish government, which confiscated it in 1997. It was returned to the Patriarchate following a European Court of Human Rights ruling in 2010.

Earlier this year, the cultural heritage organization, Europa Nostra, included it on a list of seven endangered monuments, but its fate remains unknown. The Patriarchate has said it wants it turned into an institute for environmental issue.

""Prinkipo is a very important part of the culture and heritage of Istanbul, of the Greek population of Istanbul, or the Rum population rather,"" said Burcin Altinsay, chairperson of Europa Nostra Turkey, referring to the Greek Orthodox community of Turkey. ""It is an important part of our cultural heritage and it is really in danger.""

A team from Europa Nostra and from the European Investment Bank Institute is expected to prepare a report on what needs to be done to save the building. The report will be ready by end of the year, according to the European Investment Bank Institute.

Istanbul — once Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire that was dominated by the Orthodox Church — was captured by the Muslim Ottoman Turks in 1453. Istanbul's Greek population has dwindled to less than 3,000 in recent years, but the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the seat of the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, remains in the city.

Sitting under the shade by the St. Nicholas Orthodox church in Istanbul's Yenikoy neighborhood, 80-year-old Vitleen Magulas still has vivid memories of Prinkipo, where she lived with her sister, from 1945 to 1951.

""At night, when the moon came up, it was as if you could hug it. We had very beautiful nights there,"" Magulas said.

""We had a beautiful life there, better than in our own homes,"" she said. ""We were happy with everything, our clothes, our food . At that time, there were many Greeks in Istanbul and many benefactors. They gave donations to the orphanage. We had everything. They were taking good care of us when I was there.""

Baytas fears that the structure, which suffered a fire in 1980, may not survive another winter of neglect.

""I do not know how they will repurpose the building but it does not matter, as long as it is saved,"" he said. ""The building has been decaying for years but recently the deterioration has accelerated. This year it will not survive another winter if nothing is done.""

"President Trump’s decision to slap what he called “the most biting sanctions ever” on Iran on Tuesday was a positive and necessary step to put pressure on the Islamic Republic’s corrupt regime that deprives its citizens of basic human rights, supports terrorism, fights in support of brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, and calls for death to the U.S. and Israel.

And President Trump has promised to toughen sanctions even further on Nov. 5, targeting Iran’s oil industry.

National Security Adviser John Bolton told Fox News on Tuesday: ""We want to see a much broader retreat by Iran from their support for international terrorism, their belligerent military activity in the Middle East, and their ballistic missile, nuclear-related programs.”

The Iranian people are sick and tired of their repressive leaders who rule with an iron fist and the religious police who enforce a strict Islamist code. Protests by citizens in Iran keep getting bigger and more widespread and the regime is getting more violent in trying to stop them. Citizens refuse to accept a government that can spend billions of dollars supporting terrorism, but can’t feed its own citizens.

Unless Iran’s rulers really feel the pain of sanctions themselves, they will just apply more pain to the protesters.

The Iranian economy is already a shambles and the Iranian currency is in freefall, dropping in value daily – it has lost about half its value since President Trump wisely announced in May that the U.S. would withdraw from the deeply flawed deal that was supposed to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

The new U.S. economic sanctions that President Trump imposed Tuesday are specifically designed to hurt the Iranian regime’s leaders, their businesses and their ability to operate Iran as a terror state. Unfortunately the Iranian people will suffer as well – that’s unavoidable – but they will know their oppressive rulers are hurting as well.

The American government continues to talk about how reform is badly needed in Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said it will require “enormous change” by the Iranian government to get the U.S. to remove the sanctions. America’s goal is to change the behavior of the Iranian regime both externally and internally.

The street protests by the Iranian people have sent as clear a message that the Islamist fundamentalist government does not represent the will of the people. It’s hard to see how the regime will ever be able to win back the trust of its citizens after decades of misrule and human rights violations.

While the new sanctions will certainly ratchet up the pressure on the Iranian government, there is no guarantee the regime will take steps for positive change. Iran’s leaders have continued to create problems in the region by having their proxies, the Houthis in Yemen, shoot missiles at passing ships. This caused Saudi Arabia to temporarily suspend oil shipments. That is an intolerable situation and one of the problems that sanctions on Iran are designed to stop.

The people of Iran want a change to the miserable hand they’ve been dealt. The Securities Studies Group, which I head, just published a report last week based on sources inside the country discussing what the protests are about and asking what happens next.

Our report states: “The main issues (sparking protests) are economic yet the main chants are ‘death to the dictator’ and ‘death to Rouhani.’ The grievances are increasing daily yet there is no prospect for their betterment, the latter only creates more frustration. … The protests have become more like a channel through which various groups of people vent their frustration but there is no roadmap to what to do afterwards. In other words, it is protesting for the sake of protesting.”

While the new U.S. sanctions are a great step, the Trump administration needs to also continue and even increase support for Iranian dissident groups.

As my colleague David Reaboi and Iranian activist Saghar Erica Kasraie wrote in The Federalist: “Thirty-nine years after the birth of the theocratic Shi’a regime, the president (Trump) reached out to the people of Iran, telling them: ‘The future of Iran belongs to its people. They are the rightful heirs to a rich culture and an ancient land. And they deserve a nation that does justice to their dreams, honor to their history, and glory to God.’”

The Federalist article goes on to state: “Young democracy activists need to hear this message on their own channels. U.S. government information, analysis, and policy branches need native Farsi speakers reading these and other social media daily, giving feedback and recommendations to policymakers.”

Iran’s dictatorial rulers are the most malevolent force in the Middle East. Simply stopping support for terrorist groups like Hamas and supplying military hardware to proxy armies like Hezbollah would make the region much more peaceful.

The Iranian regime’s push to become the dominant regional power and to create a land bridge from Iran to the Mediterranean by establishing a permanent presence in Syria must never be allowed to happen. Ending Iranian aggression, support for terrorism, and threats to the U.S. and Israel is in the best interests of everyone – especially the people of Iran.

The Iranian government is now under growing pressure from both sanctions and protests that show no sign of slowing. What happens next is still up in the air.

But it’s clear that if the manpower, time and treasure Iran now devotes to malign activities were instead focused on internal growth, Iran could once again be a vital economy and see the return of a vibrant Persian culture.

The Islamic Republic of Iran has imposed tyrannical and oppressive rule on a great people for far too long. It is time to restore human rights to the Iranian people and let them live freely and flourish.",politics
"A Utah man who has been jailed in Venezuela since 2016 after authorities accused him and his wife of possessing firearms has made pleas on Facebook claiming that the prison he is incarcerated in has been taken over by people trying to kill him.

Josh Holt, 26, made multiple posts on his Facebook, including two videos, claiming that the prison “has fallen” to unidentified people that are trying to kill him.

“I need help. They have taken the entire prison where I am at,” he can be heard saying in the first video. “The people have taken the entire prison. They’re outside, they’re trying to break in. They’re saying they want to kill me. They are saying that they want me as their guarantee.”

In the second video, Holt continues by “calling on the people of America” to get him out. “I have been begging my government for two years. They say that they are doing things, but I’m still here and now my life is threatened.”

Loud voices outside Holt’s cell can be heard in both videos.

Holt posted again claiming that he is “a political prisoner,” and that he was told by officials that “as long as my government continues attacking this government, and as long as (Republican Florida Sen.) Marco Rubio continues talking about me the longer that they will never let me go.”

Holt was arrested after traveling to Venezuela in the summer of 2016 to marry a woman, a Venezuelan native, who he had met on a dating website. The couple planned to marry in Venezuela, and then return to the United States.

Authorities of Venezuela claim that Holt was working with the U.S. government to overthrow President Nicolás Maduro, a plan they say involved him and his wife stockpiling weapons.

"President Trump on Friday signed three executive orders overhauling the federal bureaucracy, including an order that makes it easier to fire federal workers for misconduct.

“To empower our civil servants to best help others, the government must always operate more efficiently and more securely,” the president said in a statement.

The White House said Trump, who famously promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington while running for president, signed the three orders Friday afternoon.

The first executive order aims to strengthen accountability for federal employees and makes it easier to fire poor performers in the federal government.

The second executive order creates a federal labor relations working group to analyze union contracts with the federal government. It also makes it harder to pay federal unions to appeal firings and to lobby Congress.

The third executive order, focused on federal unions, is aimed at reducing waste and expenditures and requires federal employees to spend at least 75 percent of their time working on the job they were hired to do, as opposed to working on federal union work. It will also allow the federal government to start charging unions for office space in federal buildings.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Andrew Bremberg, who leads Trump’s domestic policy council, said the orders ""will make it easier for agencies to remove poor-performing employees and ensure that taxpayer dollars are more efficiently used.”

The Journal also reported that unions representing federal employees said the orders would deprive their members of significant labor rights.

“These executive orders are a direct assault on the legal rights and protections that Congress has specifically guaranteed to the two million public-sector employees across the country who work for the federal government,” said J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees, whose membership includes some 700,000 U.S. government and D.C. workers.

“This administration seems hellbent on replacing a civil service that works for all taxpayers with a political service that serves at its whim,” The Journal quoted Cox as saying.

Cox said in the newspaper that his union was prepared to take its challenge to Congress and the public.

"Every time I experience Israel, I feel a sense of serenity, holiness and kinship that I find nowhere else. This must be what makes me keep coming me back. I have been visiting the Holy Land – the land of miracles in the Bible – for 45 years, with several trips each year.

On each trip to Israel, my relationship with the Lord grows deeper and I am privileged to share that journey with others, drawing on my roots from years ago as an evangelical pastor to ensure they too feel that joy and wonder.

But my continuing religious growth is only part of the reason I return so often to the Holy Land of the Bible. I also feel a deep sense of belonging in the country, both politically and socially. Going to Israel is a bit like going home. That’s why it is so important to continue to pray and act for Israel’s survival and serenity.

On Sept. 7 I will be joining people across the globe to pray for peace and stability in Israel and for a return to civility for all mankind.

Each year, Acheinu – the outreach arm of the nonprofit educational organization Dirshu – holds a Day of Jewish Unity. On this day, individuals – Jews and non-Jews alike – are asked to come together and promise to be kinder and more caring, while praying for peace.

Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East, needs our support now more than ever. With rising anti-Semitism and hostilities from Israel’s Arab neighbors, our Israeli brothers and sisters need us. Supporting Israel not only helps its citizens, but helps us in America as well.

Like the United States, Israel believes in freedom, democracy and fighting terrorism in all its forms. Israel is our truest ally in the Middle East, with values more closely aligned to ours than any other Middle Eastern nation.

As a Christian, I know that Israel is sacred and is a fulfillment of prophecy in the Bible. God wants Israel to stay strong and grow. We need an Israel free from violence, with Jerusalem as its united capital.

There are too many forces in our world trying to destroy the Jewish people and the Holy Land, but Jews need to stay strong and united – and we must join them.

Acheinu promotes this day of prayer in honor of Rabbi Israel Meir Kagan, who devoted his entire life to promoting respect and civility and cautioning about the evils of gossip. Though Rabbi Kagan died in 1933, his teachings live on.

I think if Rabbi Kagan was alive today to see how divided the world still is, he would be disappointed. And yet, through the rabbi’s teachings, I also know that he would not give up hope but would continue to call for courtesy, understanding and cohesion.

As Americans, we are blessed to have the right to speak our minds and voice opposition to the government without fear of reprisal. But there is a difference between articulating your views and spreading vitriol.

We can disagree with one another, yet remain courteous. A disagreement does not have to be a fight. I think it is safe to say that Christian scholars, both present and past, and Rabbi Kagan would have agreed on this.

It has saddened me greatly to see how my own daughter, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has been treated this past year by those on the other side of the political aisle and many in the media.

My daughter is a kind, caring and good-hearted wife and mother, so it pains me to see the near-constant personal attacks made against her. This is not to say you cannot disagree with her or with the White House she represents, but the key to civil discourse is civility.

As Americans, we do not have to always agree with one another – in fact, it is our disagreements that often heighten our dialogue and ideas.

But, as Americans, we must remember that we are “one nation, under God.” Just as the Jewish people, though divided into many denominations, still view themselves as one people with a common interest in supporting and protecting the Holy Land, so must we as Americans come together.

We must unite against those who would wish to destroy all that we – and our forefathers – stand for. We can disagree, but we should also be proud that together we make the strongest democracy in the world.

On Sept. 7, please join me in praying to God for peace and the continued prosperity of Israel and all mankind. And back up your prayers with your interactions with others by reminding yourself to be kind, courteous and always civil.",world
"Sen. Bernie Sanders took aim President Trump Monday morning during an appearance at Labor Day union breakfast in the state that holds the first presidential primary, but kept mum on a possible second White House bid for himself.

The longtime independent senator from Vermont - who energized progressives across the country as he battled eventual Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign - sparked more speculation about his 2020 presidential ambitions as he headlined the New Hampshire AFL-CIO's annual Labor Day breakfast.

In his speech, Sanders blasted Trump, saying: ""We have a president, and I say this with no joy in my heart, who is a pathological liar.""

Sanders added: ""We have a president for cheap political reasons who is trying to divide us up.""

Sanders claimed that Trump has been teaching people to ""hate other people because they may have been born in a different country, color of their skin is different, their religion is different, their sexual orientation may be different.""

Sanders also repeatedly charged that the Republican majority in the Senate and House ""are exactly on the wrong side of where the American people are.""

The Vermont lawmaker, who headlined the New Hampshire Labor Day breakfast for the fifth straight year, urged voters to stand together.

""We need to stand together and we will not allow Trump or anybody else to divide us up based on color of our skin, our religion, our nationality, or our sexual orientation,"" he said. ""When we stand together we win. When they divide us up, they win.""

Sanders, who is running for re-election in Vermont this November for a third term in the Senate, didn't make any references to the next White House race. Instead, he highlighted his progressive agenda, including his signature platforms of Medicare for all and a $15-per-hour minimum wage.

""I was in New Hampshire three years ago, coming before you and the people of this state, and I said, we need to move toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer program,"" Sanders said. ""Seemed like a radical idea then. Oh my god, single payer, Medicare for all, radical idea.""

He added: ""I'm proud to tell you that legislation that I've offered in the Senate raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour now has 30 co-sponsors, and all across this country, cities and states are moving towards $15 an hour.""

The senator also pushed for strengthening Social Security, income equality and new gun laws during his speech.

""We come from rural states, New Hampshire and Vermont,"" he said. ""And a lot of our people hunt and own guns. But I believe that in our states and throughout this country, the overwhelming majority of the American people support common-sense gun safety legislation.""

Sanders crushed Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire primary, launching him into a months-long fight with Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Many of his top supporters from that campaign were in the audience at the Labor Day breakfast.

""I think Bernie's message is spot on - we need to come together and we'll figure out the way to do that with whomever is leading the charge,” said Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky, who was legal counsel and a member of the steering committee for Sanders' campaign in New Hampshire. ""It will take a little bit to work out, but I think we're going to be fine.""

Asked if the New Hampshire voters were ready for the possibility of another White House bid by Sanders, Volinsky said, ""I think we have quite a crew. And that crew is still here and I see them at these events all the time.""

Sanders' son, Levi, a New Hampshire resident, is one of 11 Democrats currently running for the open congressional seat in the state's 1st District. However, the elder Sanders has stayed neutral in the race and has refrained from endorsing his son since Levi Sanders announced his candidacy in late February.

Still, the senator did give his son a very quick shout-out near the beginning of the speech, saying, ""Let me also thank my son Levi, who is here. Levi, stand up.""",politics
"Senate Democrats grilled Judge Brett Kavanaugh on abortion, guns and other issues Wednesday, getting down to substance after an opening day of partisan fireworks -- even as protesters continued to disrupt his confirmation hearing.

Kavanaugh, President Trump’s pick to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, appeared for the second day of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It’s the first day senators have to question Kavanaugh.

California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s ranking member and the first Democrat to question the nominee, began her questioning of Kavanaugh by referencing the outbursts.

“I'm sorry about the circumstances, but we'll get through it,” she said.

Feinstein asked the nominee about his past case argument that Washington D.C.’s assault weapons ban was unconstitutional. He said he was following the precedent of the Supreme Court.

Kavanaugh, who grew up near Washington, replied that he fully understands how gang, gun and drug violence plagues cities “but as a judge, my job as I saw it was to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court.""

Feinstein pressed Kavanaugh over the Roe v. Wade court decision regarding abortion.

“Well, as a general proposition, I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe versus Wade,” he said.

Feinstein also asked Kavanaugh about past comments regarding investigations involving a president, a key issue amid the Russia probe that has implicated numerous Trump associates. A staffer held up a sign with a 1999 law review quote from Kavanaugh that said, “If the president were the sole subject of an investigation, I would say no one should be investigating that.”

Kavanaugh said he’s never taken a position on the constitutionality of whether a president should be investigated while in office. He claimed those past comments were about the “balance of a president fighting a war, leading a war, and a president subject to say ordinary civil lawsuits,” like former President Bill Clinton faced.

Kavanaugh, a former lawyer under President George W. Bush, used the hearing to portray himself as an independent judge.

“The first thing that makes a good judge is independence, not being swayed by political or public pressure,” Kavanaugh said, under questioning from committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. “That takes some backbone, that takes some judicial fortitude.”

Democrats on the panel, including a number thought to be considering a presidential run in 2020, Democrats, have sounded the alarm about Kavanaugh’s past work in Republican politics, including as a lawyer in George W. Bush’s White House.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., pressed Kavanaugh about what he knew about the Bush administration’s warrantless surveillance program. Leahy also asked Kavanaugh if a president has a right to pardon himself, a power President Trump has said he believes he has.

“The question of self-pardons is something I have never analyzed,” Kavanaugh replied, calling it a “hypothetical question that I can't begin to answer in this context as a sitting judge and as a nominee to the Supreme Court.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., gave Kavanaugh a chance to address the father of a student killed in Florida school massacre this year, among other activists, who showed up to the hearing. That father made news after unsuccessfully attempting to shake Kavanaugh's hand during a break on Tuesday.

“I want to reassure everyone that I base my decisions on the law, but I do so with an awareness of the facts and an awareness of the real world consequences,” Kavanaugh replied, adding, “I have not lived in a bubble.”

The Republicans and Democrats on the panel are being given 30 minutes each to ask Kavanaugh questions on live television. The questioning could go late into the evening Wednesday, and is set to continue through the week.

Moments after Grassley opened the hearing Wednesday, shouting could be heard from the back of the room: “Sham president, sham justice!”

The interruptions from protesters that started a day earlier continued, as Grassley dinged Democrats for wasting time a day earlier on “disruption and disorder over procedural matters.”

“Democratic senators interrupted the hearing 63 times before lunch and in the audience 70 people were arrested yesterday who were following their lead,” Grassley said.

Ironically, protesters continued to shout as Kavanaugh discussed how he tried to be respectful in court.

""I’ve tried to be a very collegial judge, I’ve tried to be civil,"" he said.

When the disruptions continued, Kavanaugh asked Grassley, “Should I proceed?”

Grassley told Kavanaugh to continue speaking, despite the outbursts.

“Let these people have their free speech and interrupt the other 300 million people listening,” the Iowa Republican said.

KAVANAUGH VOWS TO 'KEEP AN OPEN MIND IN EVERY CASE'

The protests have been a recurring feature since the hearings began.

“I just wish we could have a hearing where the nominee's kids could show up,"" Graham of South Carolina said, referencing the outbursts. ""Is that asking too much?”

As a protester yelled, Graham continued: “So what kind of country have we become? None of this happened just a couple years ago. It's getting worse and worse and worse.""

On Tuesday, protests from Democratic lawmakers and demonstrators delayed the formal start of proceedings by more than an hour.

The spectacle has underscored the political nature of the confirmation hearings, coming two months before the midterms and as some senators gear up for a possible 2020 presidential run against Trump. Several of those senators led the charge Tuesday in objecting to Kavanaugh.

Kavanaugh has left one of the longest paper trails of any recent Supreme Court nominee, having served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office in the George W. Bush administration.

Kavanaugh also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.

Democrats have specifically raised objections over how the Senate received 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents the night before the confirmation hearing began.

Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch.

The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee.

Republicans command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, which would return to 51-49 once a Republican successor to the late Sen. John McCain is seated. While the hearing was ongoing Tuesday, former Sen. Jon Kyl was named to that seat.

Republicans have said they hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

"President Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen’s guilty pleas Tuesday are unlikely to result in criminal charges against the president. But the pleas admitting to campaign finance violations could be used by Democrats to try to impeach the president, should they win control of the U.S. House in November.

Cohen said in his guilty pleas in U.S. District Court in New York City that he had failed to pay taxes on his taxi business and misrepresented his assets in a loan application. Cohen also pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws when he arranged for hush-money payments shortly before the 2016 presidential election to two women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump. The president has denied having these affairs.

Cohen will be sentenced later this year. His plea deal may help him avoid a sentence of over 60 years in prison.

A jury could potentially find the payments to the women to be a violation of campaign finance laws, because the money paid to them was meant to aid Trump politically, and was above and beyond the contribution-limit for donating to a candidate’s campaign. It wouldn’t be illegal for Trump to make these payments, but Cohen claims that Trump ordered him to orchestrate the payments, which could be a crime.

Cohen said he arranged the payments of $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels (whose real name is Stephanie Clifford) and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal “in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office” – Donald Trump.

Because of that, even though Cohen’s plea didn’t include a cooperation agreement with prosecutors, many are speculating that in an effort to reduce his prison sentence Cohen will cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to go after the president.

But Mueller is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections and allegations that Trump or his campaign conspired with the Russians to defeat Hillary Clinton. No one is alleging Russia had anything to do with the payments made to Daniels or McDougal.

Of course, the Cohen guilty plea received heavy coverage in the media. The stock market dropped after-hours. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who sees collusion under every rock and around every corner, said the development added to the president’s “legal jeopardy.”

The anti-Trump “resistance” – people who wake up every day hoping that the president will be removed from office – found a moment of happiness. The happiness won’t last long.

This controversy is ultimately a political matter – even if prosecutors conclude Cohen is telling the truth, Justice Department guidelines say a sitting president can’t be indicted. If Democrats want to remove President Trump from office, the proper avenue is impeachment.

But Trump-hating Democrats who pursue impeachment will be punished by the American voter – the more Middle America learns the facts of the Cohen case, the worse the president’s opponents will look.

Go back to square one. Once the allegations about the payments to Daniels and McDougal were publicized in media reports, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York – at the behest of Mueller – got a search warrant for Cohen’s office, home and hotel room where he was temporarily staying.

FBI agents raided the locations in April. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing Mueller’s Russia investigation, signed off on the raids.

The shocking thing is that the Justice Department got a judge to approve the raids, despite attorney-client privilege that should have protected communications between Cohen and his client, Donald Trump.

That’s a big problem. In the president’s words, it is “Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) – almost unheard of.” He’s exactly right.

The Justice Department, however, claimed that it was protecting attorney-client privilege because its people were sifting through Cohen’s documents and determining what was privileged and what was not. That is reprehensible.

In the words of attorney and law professor Alan Dershowitz, “the very fact that this material is seen or read by a government official constitutes a core violation (of the Sixth Amendment). It would be the same if the government surreptitiously recorded a confession of a penitent to a priest, or a description of symptoms by a patient to a doctor, or a discussion of their sex life between a husband and wife. The government simply has no right to this material.”

The Justice Department’s excuse for this behavior is the little-used “crime-fraud exception” to the rule of attorney-client privilege. The theory is that Cohen’s payments had constituted a crime co-committed by Cohen and Trump, which would negate any attorney-client privilege between them on this matter.

The problem with this fudge is that President Trump has still not been credibly implicated in a campaign finance violation. Trump has already admitted, through his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, to compensating Cohen for his payment to Stormy Daniels – though Trump says he did not know about the payment until after it was made.

As for the payment to McDougal, American Media Inc. (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer, made the payment, not Michael Cohen. And it is unclear if Cohen ever actually compensated AMI for its payment.

And what if everything Cohen stated in his guilty plea is true?

Remember former North Carolina Democratic U.S. Sen. John Edwards? Donors paid $1 million to Edwards’ mistress to keep quiet just before the 2008 Democrat presidential primaries when Edwards was a candidate.

Federal prosecutors charged Edwards with campaign finance violations but he was acquitted, largely because the contributions didn’t go directly to his campaign, though Edwards also argued that the payment was meant to hide his extramarital affair from his dying wife. There’s even a name for this sad business – the “mistress loophole.”

There are other problems with the Cohen case that are less concrete but should still be mentioned. Cohen is smarmy, but smarmy or not, he has an incentive to cooperate with prosecutors to get the lightest punishment possible for his crimes.

If Cohen doesn’t cooperate, or maybe even “compose,” he faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison. The fact that Cohen’s lawyer is Clinton-confidant Lanny Davis, and that the judge in the case is Kimba Wood – who was almost Bill Clinton’s attorney general – might raise a few eyebrows as well.

To many Americans, it seems that men like Cohen, former Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort (who was convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud charges Tuesday), and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn (who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI on highly suspect grounds) have been targeted for prosecution simply because of their association with Donald Trump.

We now live in a country where pundits on the left explicitly hope that people working for President Trump will be prosecuted. In other words, they argue that the selective use of justice is a good thing if it is directed against conservatives or supporters of the president.

That is chilling. Without a concerted effort from the American people to condemn such political prosecutions, things will only get worse.",politics
"A sweep of Northern California by federal immigration officials this week, which was partly thwarted when the Oakland mayor sounded the alarm, nabbed a number of illegal immigrants convicted of a variety of serious and violent crimes.

Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials announced this week that the four-day raid led to the arrest of 232 illegal immigrants in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Of those 232, 180 “were either convicted criminals, had been issued a final order of removal and failed to depart the United States, or had been previously removed” from the country and had come back illegally.

The arrests included 115 who ""had prior felony convictions for serious or violent offenses, such as child sex crimes, weapons charges and assault, or had past convictions for significant or multiple misdemeanors.""

The numbers might have been greater, but for the intervention of Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who tweeted out a warning of the impending raid, tipping off others who might have been caught.

Acting ICE Director Tom Homan said on ""Fox & Friends"" that Schaaf’s warning meant that there are roughly 800 illegal immigrants they were unable to locate.

""What she did is no better than a gang lookout yelling 'police' when a police cruiser comes in the neighborhood, except she did it to a whole community. This is beyond the pale,"" he said.

An ICE spokesperson gave Fox News a list of the types of crimes for which those arrested in the raid had been convicted. They cover a range of bad behavior: aggravated assault, murder, hit-run, lewd acts with a minor, burglary, cruelty toward a child, indecent exposure, domestic violence, drug trafficking, battery, sex offenses and false imprisonment.

ICE pointed, in particular, to the case of Armando Nunez-Salgado, a Mexican gang member who had been deported four times and had convictions including assault with a deadly weapon, burglary, hit-and-run causing injury and evasion of a police officer.

ICE ARRESTS 232 PEOPLE IN FOUR-DAY RAID OF CALIFORNIA'S BAY AREA

Another deportee was a Mexican gang member with convictions for, among other things, possession of a dangerous weapon, spousal abuse, burglary and battery on a police officer.

Officials were furious with the Oakland mayor's actions to diminish the effectiveness of the raid.

In a statement, ICE also said that recent legislation has hurt the agency’s ability to enforce immigration laws.

“Recent legislation has negatively impacted ICE operations in California by nearly eliminating all cooperation and communication with our law enforcement partners in the state by prohibiting local law enforcement from contracting with the federal government to house detainees,” the statement said.

“Ultimately, efforts by local politicians have shielded removable criminal aliens from immigration enforcement and created another magnet for more illegal immigration, all at the expense of the safety and security of the very people it purports to protect,” it said.

The White House called Mayor Schaaf’s actions “outrageous” and said the Department of Justice was conducting a review.

“I think it’s outrageous that a mayor would circumvent federal authorities and certainly put them in danger by making a move such as that,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Thursday

But Schaaf was unapologetic.

""I did what I believe was right for my community as well as to protect public safety,"" Schaaf said Friday, according to NBC Bay Area. ""People should be able to live without fear or panic and know their rights and responsibilities as well as their recourses.""

"A Massachusetts woman was reportedly taken into custody on Monday after she allegedly drove into a car sporting a Trump bumper sticker.

The arrest of Chloe Wright, 25, followed an alleged hit-and-run in Hyannis on June 30, the Cape Cod Times reported, citing a police report.

After the incident, the man she hit reportedly contacted the Barnstable Police Department and recalled hearing a motorist behind him honking their car horn as he waited at a red light.

According to the police report, the honking continued and by the time he reached another red light, the motorist started shouting at him, the Times reported.

Fearing that the alleged honking and shouting was regarding a problem with his car, the man reportedly got out, at which point, the man said he heard the other motorist shouting about his bumper sticker supporting Trump, according to the report.

“She said, ‘You voted for Trump?’” the man recalled her saying. “I said yes. She called me a racist and several other names.”

The man then claimed that the woman repositioned her vehicle and hit his car with hers, the Times said, citing the police report. After this, the woman reportedly left the scene.

“She bent my door and I had to lean back to avoid getting hit,” the man reportedly said. “She also hit the side of my car.”

She reportedly pleaded not guilty during a court appearance on Monday and was freed on a $1,250 bond. The Times reported that she was also charged with vandalizing property and leaving the scene of property damage.

"The National Archives denied Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s request Friday for documents related to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s time as staff secretary under George W. Bush.

The head of NARA, archivist David Ferriero, in a letter to Schumer, says the requests for certain sensitive documents for Kavanaugh’s time as Bush staff secretary need to come from the Judiciary Committee’s office, per longstanding precedent. The committee is at odds over the scope of documents from that period, the number of which could run into the hundreds of thousands.

Ferriero said the National Archives and Records Administration has declined to process similar requests from the lead Republicans on the Judiciary Committee in connection with the nominations of Attorney General Eric Holder and Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan during the administration of President Barack Obama.

On Thursday the National Archives said it would not be able to completely review more than 900,000 pages requested by Republicans until the end of October. Senate Republicans blasted Democrats, deeming the request for more documents as a tactic of delay.

""It's just amazing to me they make such a farce of this,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. He urged the Senate not to continue ""down this partisan, picky, stupid"" path.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said the documents already being sought would stack as high as the Capitol dome.

"Democrats who drafted a bill to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE] suddenly announced Thursday night that they would vote against it if the legislation went to the floor, after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Fox News he intended to call their bluff.

""We know Speaker [Paul] Ryan is not serious about passing our 'Establishing a Humane Immigration Enforcement System Act,' so members of Congress, advocacy groups, and impacted communities will not engage in this political stunt,"" Reps. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Adriano Espaillat of New York told The Hill and other news outlets. ""If Speaker Ryan puts our bill on the floor, we plan to vote no and will instead use the opportunity to force an urgently needed and long-overdue conversation on the House floor.""

McCarthy, R-Calif., said earlier Thursday he would place a bill to abolish ICE on the House floor later this month.

Democrats have long pushed back on the administration’s immigration policies but tensions have escalated in the past month over family separations at the border. Calls from some far-left lawmakers to abolish ICE have grown ahead of the November elections.

Former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., last week slammed the federal agency as being a part of a “cruel, dysfunctional immigration system” that needs “comprehensive” reform.

One of the first senators to push for eradicating ICE was Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., who said last month that ICE “has become a deportation force” which should be abolished.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio echoed Gillibrand, calling the agency “broken” and “divisive.”

“It should be abolished,” he tweeted.

As analysts point out, if Democrats vote against the proposal and kill it, it undermines their word. If they earn enough ""yes"" votes, Republicans could turn the issue and tie all Democrats to the crisis at the border.

Perhaps sensing trouble ahead of the primaries, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California have called instead for the agency to be restructured.

"Pope Francis on Monday recommended silence and prayer to deal with those who ""only seek scandal,"" division and destruction in what appeared to be an indirect response to allegations that he had covered up for a U.S. cardinal embroiled in sex abuse scandals.

Italian Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, a former papal envoy in Washington, stunned the faithful last month by claiming Francis allegedly lifted unconfirmed Vatican sanctions against disgraced U.S. prelate Theodore McCarrick and demanding that the pope resign.

""With people lacking good will, with people who only seek scandal, who seek only division, who seek only destruction, even within the family — silence, prayer"" is the path to take, Francis said in his homily during morning Mass at the Vatican hotel where he lives.

Hours after Vigano made the claim in a statement given to conservative Catholic news media, Francis had told journalists seeking his response that he ""won't say a word"" about the sensational claims.

In his homily Monday, Francis indicated that he might be taking his cue from God on whether to speak out or not about Vigano's allegations.

""May the Lord give us the grace to discern when we should speak and when we should stay silent,"" Francis said. ""This applies to every part of life: to work, at home, in society.""

Francis also spoke about how Jesus, when confronting the devil, responded with silence. Francis also described the truth as being meek and silent.

Vigano has contended that while Benedict XVI was pope, he had sanctioned McCarrick, including avoiding public life, but that Francis later allegedly lifted the punishment.

During the years that McCarrick was purportedly under sanctions, the cardinal celebrated public Masses and attended public functions, even before Francis became pontiff. Vigano claimed that he told Francis, shortly after he was elected pontiff in 2013, that McCarrick had been given sanctions by Benedict.

Weeks before Vigano went public with his claims, Francis in July yanked McCarrick's cardinal rank after U.S. investigations found sex abuse claims credible. McCarrick has denied wrongdoing.

It was the first time that a prelate had lost his cardinal's rank in a sex abuse scandal, and the move was widely viewed as an indication that Francis was trying to make good on promises to crack down on clerics who either were found to have abused minors or adults, or covered up for priests who did.

After decades of complaints by faithful in the United States and elsewhere that they were sexually abused as minors or adults by priests, or that their abuses were quietly shuffled from parish to parish, the church, including at the Vatican, has been struggling to effectively deal with the problem, including the role of higher-ups in hiding the abuses.

Vladimir Putin's Russia appears to have emerged as a player in Afghanistan after 17 years of Western involvement that has left the country no closer to peace than before.

To some, Russia's offer to host talks next month might contain at least the seeds of a positive pivot if the Taliban are coaxed to the table at a time when they have been more aggressive on the battlefield than in recent years, causing much mayhem in Kabul and other cities.

But the move may be stuck before it even begins. The Afghan government has said it will not attend, unable to agree on a coherent strategy because of divisions within the government that many see as a function of personal and ethnic rivalries, and calling for the Taliban to first agree to direct talks with Kabul. The insurgents have consistently refused, instead demanding direct talks with the United States.

The U.S., for its part, seems displeased by the maneuver, even though Washington has been trying to find a reasonable exit strategy for years in vain.

On the ground in Afghanistan, the situation has given rise to boundless cynicism about the various players and almost no hope for a quick improvement in the violent, corruption-plagued nature of daily life.

Analysts say the wrangling over a meeting to talk peace offers a window into the enormity of the task of actually reaching a peace pact in a region of competing influences. Pakistan, Iran, Russia and China have a growing influence even as the United States spends billions of dollars covering much of the $6.5 billion spent annually to support the Afghan National Security Forces who are struggling to contain an energized Taliban.

Specialists who have tracked Afghanistan's four decades of war say navigating the road to peace in this poor nation of 32 million people is like walking through a minefield.

Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the U.S.-based Wilson Center, said the situation is explosive.

""In Afghanistan you have not just the U.S. and Russia in competition, but also China, Iran, and Pakistan,"" said Kugelman. ""And none of these countries have warm relations with the U.S. It's a real powder keg, to say the least.""

Pakistan, considered key to a lasting peace in Afghanistan, has a new prime minister who says he is ready to be a partner in peace with Washington, but will no longer partner in war. There has been no indication that the Afghan Taliban, who are known to move between Pakistan and Afghanistan with an ease that varies often depending on Islamabad's relationship with Washington, will be asked to leave. Yet Prime Minister Imran Khan was quick to condemn last Tuesday's rocket attack in Kabul, accusing the perpetrators of ""cowardly thinking.""

Still, relations between Pakistan and the United States are prickly and even a simple phone call from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Khan on Thursday turned into a confrontation as the two countries disagreed over its content. Pakistan is now demanding an apology, saying Pompeo said nothing of terrorists in Pakistan, contrary to the State Department's reading of the call, which said: ""Pompeo raised the importance of Pakistan taking decisive action against all terrorists operating in Pakistan and its vital role in promoting the Afghan peace process.""

But Afghanistan's neighbors and competing world powers are only part of the problem of bringing peace to Afghanistan, say analysts, who point to a deeply corrupt and fractious Afghan government and deepening ethnic divisions within the U.S.-crafted Unity government.

Last year, Transparency International ranked Afghanistan 177 out of 180 countries, only slightly better than the world's worst __ Syria, South Sudan and Somalia. Since the U.S.-crafted Unity Government took power four years ago, ethnic divisions that have always troubled Afghanistan have deepened.

During a recent interview in the Afghan capital Kabul, political analyst Haroon Mir said international pressure is all that holds Afghanistan's squabbling politicians together. He said the government is deeply divided along ethnic lines and warned that a withdrawal of international forces would set one ethnic group against another, led by the warlords-cum-politicians, who dominate Afghanistan's government and whose militias are heavily armed.

""Kabul will be destroyed because every different faction in the government wants to get control,"" he said. ""This time it would be ethnic fighting that destroys Kabul.""

Internal rivalries within the Afghan government have made it impossible to develop a counterinsurgency strategy, said Kugelman.

""So long as the Afghan government remains consumed by personality, disputes and other internal dysfunction, Kabul won't be in any shape to craft an effective counterinsurgency strategy, no matter how much help it may get from the U.S. and other key partners,"" he said.

But perhaps even worse for the U.S., which has lost hundreds of lives in Afghanistan and spent billions of dollars on the conflict, Western countries have come to be seen in very jaded ways, with a variety of outlandish theories enjoying surprising currency. One widely spread theory is that Washington is secretly aiding the Taliban to foment violence as an excuse to keep its troops in Afghanistan to counter Iran, Russia and China.

The Taliban, meanwhile, have ramped up their diplomatic forays, having traveled to Uzbekistan and Indonesia to meet the foreign ministers there. They also said they would travel to China and Pakistan before next month's Moscow meeting.

On the battlefield this month they have carried out spectacular attacks in central Ghazni, where they resisted Afghan security forces backed by U.S. military advisers and aerial support for nearly five days, and in northern Faryab province, where more than 100 Afghan soldiers who ran out of ammunition and food eventually surrendered to the insurgents.

But analysts say the Taliban's control and influence — while far-reaching — is limited to rural areas and they do not have the capacity to take control and keep a city in Afghanistan. They also face divisions within their ranks and need to show their foot soldiers they are strong militarily before they enter peace talks.

Still, Brian Glyn Williams, professor of Islamic History at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, called the September meeting in Moscow a ""fascinating and potentially important/historic development.""

"The following farewell statement from the late Sen. John McCain was read aloud Monday at a press conference in Phoenix, by his former campaign manager Rick Davis:

“My fellow Americans, whom I have gratefully served for sixty years, and especially my fellow Arizonans,

“Thank you for the privilege of serving you and for the rewarding life that service in uniform and in public office has allowed me to lead. I have tried to serve our country honorably. I have made mistakes, but I hope my love for America will be weighed favorably against them.

“I have often observed that I am the luckiest person on earth. I feel that way even now as I prepare for the end of my life. I have loved my life, all of it. I have had experiences, adventures and friendships enough for ten satisfying lives, and I am so thankful. Like most people, I have regrets. But I would not trade a day of my life, in good or bad times, for the best day of anyone else’s.

“I owe that satisfaction to the love of my family. No man ever had a more loving wife or children he was prouder of than I am of mine. And I owe it to America. To be connected to America’s causes – liberty, equal justice, respect for the dignity of all people – brings happiness more sublime than life’s fleeting pleasures. Our identities and sense of worth are not circumscribed but enlarged by serving good causes bigger than ourselves.

“‘Fellow Americans’ – that association has meant more to me than any other. I lived and died a proud American. We are citizens of the world’s greatest republic, a nation of ideals, not blood and soil. We are blessed and are a blessing to humanity when we uphold and advance those ideals at home and in the world. We have helped liberate more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. We have acquired great wealth and power in the process.

“We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down, when we doubt the power of our ideals, rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been.

“We are three-hundred-and-twenty-five million opinionated, vociferous individuals. We argue and compete and sometimes even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement. If only we remember that and give each other the benefit of the presumption that we all love our country we will get through these challenging times. We will come through them stronger than before. We always do.

“Ten years ago, I had the privilege to concede defeat in the election for president. I want to end my farewell to you with the heartfelt faith in Americans that I felt so powerfully that evening. I feel it powerfully still.

“Do not despair of our present difficulties but believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.

“Farewell, fellow Americans. God bless you, and God bless America.”",politics
"The National Enquirer kept a safe of documents related to hush-money payments and other potentially damaging stories about then-candidate Donald Trump, according to a report.

The Associated Press, citing people familiar with the Enquirer’s parent company, American Media Inc., reported Thursday that the safe was “a great source of power” for publisher David Pecker -- who, in addition to so-called catch-and-kill deals with Trump, would also obtain exclusive rights to embarrassing stories about other people, including celebrities.

Pecker would buy the rights to the stories with no intention to publish, but instead use them to get in the subject’s good graces and acquire favors, according to the AP.

“It’s ‘I did this for you,’ now what can you do for me,” Jerry George, a former Enquirer reporter told the AP. “They always got something in return.”

Over fears of liability, the alleged documents were reportedly removed from the safe by Pecker, and the company’s chief content officer, Dylan Howard, leading up to Trump’s inauguration following a Wall Street Journal report about a catch-and-kill involving McDougal, the AP reported, citing a person directly faimilar with the events.

What exactly happened to the documents was unclear.

The Enquirer was allegedly involved in hush-money deals with Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen involving porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal to shut down allegations of affairs with the Trump.

Sources confirmed to Fox News on Thursday that Pecker struck an immunity deal with federal prosecutors in New York in exchange for information in the investigation into hush-money payments by Cohen.

Trump has repeatedly denied the affairs. He told Fox News on Wednesday that he wasn’t aware of the payments made by Cohen until “later on,” while maintaining they were not campaign funds.

“Later on I knew. Later on. What he did — and they weren’t taken out of the campaign finance, that’s the big thing. That’s a much bigger thing,” Trump said Wednesday. “Did they come out of the campaign? They didn’t come out of the campaign, they came from me.""

Previously in April, Trump said he did not know about the Daniels payment. Last month, an audio conversation between Trump and Cohen was obtained by CNN that discussed purchasing the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal’s story of her 2006 affair with Trump.

Vanity Fair first reported the immunity deal.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Pecker, who like Cohen was close with Trump, provided information on Cohen and the president in the criminal probe.

Cohen plead guilty to eight counts Tuesday, including campaign finance violations connected to the hush money payments “at the direction” of then-candidate Trump.

Former Enquirer employees told the AP that Trump stories, dating back more than a decade, were killed on arrival.

According to the AP, Cohen began pushing the Enquirer in 2010 to promote the idea of a potential Trump presidency, and was involved with the outlet’s decision to start questioning President Barack Obama’s birthplace.

"A staff running on McDonald's, Red Bull and Oreos; “Rocket Man” and “Tiny Dancer” blasting through the Trump Force One speakers; profanity-laced tirades; a “superstitious” candidate who never sleeps – that was the 2016 Trump campaign, according to top ex-aides who have lifted the curtain on “the ride of a lifetime.”

In their book set for release on Tuesday, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowksi and deputy campaign manager David Bossie speak fondly of their former boss but give a warts-and-all view of day-to-day operations inside the campaign.

“Loyalty and unvarnished truth can coexist,” they write. “In fact, one doesn’t survive without the other.”

Fox News obtained an early copy of nearly 300-page book, “Let Trump Be Trump.” It is the account of two Trump loyalists who explain how a team of outsiders -- and political novices -- launched a campaign that would achieve one of the biggest upsets in U.S. election history.

It wasn't pretty.

The book acknowledges Trump’s campaign staff did not have much political experience — one chapter is titled “The Island of Misfit Toys.”

MCDONALDS, KFC AND OREOS FROM UNOPENED PACKAGES: TRUMP'S FAST-FOOD HABITS REVEALED

Lewandowski and Bossie recall an encounter with then-campaign press secretary and now-White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, who they said had “about as much experience as a coffee cup.”

“Hope had so little knowledge of politics then that when Corey told her he had worked for the Kochs she asked if he knew Danny Masters. ‘He’s worked for Coke for a while,’ she said,” one passage reads.

The authors also provide additional details about what makes Trump tick – that “nothing makes the boss angrier than when someone embarrasses his children” and that he is “one of the most superstitious men that most people have ever met.” The book says Trump sometimes throws “salt over his shoulder before he eats” and believes that people with “low energy” may “carry bad luck.”

But one of the most dramatic sections of the book focuses on the first encounters between Trump and future campaign chairman and manager Paul Manafort (who has since been charged in connection with the Russia investigation).

“Wow, you’re a good-looking guy,” Trump said, ahead of bringing Manafort onto his team as a delegate-wrangler for the Republican National Convention.

The first Trump-Manafort meeting was set to be private, but Lewandowski recalls fielding reporter questions the following morning.

“Corey knew from that moment on that Manafort was a leaker,” the book reads. “Corey could also tell good people from bad, and he could tell right away that Paul was a bad guy.”

Lewandowski, who had guided Trump through most of his primary election victories, was ousted as campaign manager ahead of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio in July 2016.

“During that first dinner at Mar-a-Lago, I thought Manafort was the cavalry coming to help. I didn’t think he was coming to stick a shiv in my back – but that’s what dishonest people do,” Lewandowski writes.

Manafort wanted to shift the campaign’s message, and “show them the real Donald Trump” moving forward. Manafort planned to do all of the television appearances for the campaign – a strategy that didn’t quite appeal to Trump.

“‘Paul said he doesn’t want you on TV,’” Hicks told the president while flying on his plane, according to the book.

“Mr. Trump goes f---ing ballistic. We’re over the metropolitan area, so you can get cell service if you fly at a low altitude,” the authors write.

“‘Lower it!’” Trump yelled to the pilot, according to their account. “‘I have to make a call.’”

Lewandowksi and Bossie write of a profanity-laden call Trump made to Manafort.

“’I’ll go on TV anytime I goddamn f---ing want and you won’t say another f---ing word about me! Tone it down? I wanna turn it up! I don’t wanna tone anything down,” Trump allegedly yelled. “‘I played along with your delegate charts, but I have had enough.’”

This apparently was not the only time Trump berated Manafort.

Lewandowski and Bossie recall another meeting at Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, N.J., when he met Manafort, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and other top aides for debate prep in August 2016.

The authors describe Manafort as wearing “boat shoes, white capri pants with string ties, and a blue blazer complete with a crest on the breast pocket.”

“‘You think I’m a baby, Paul?’ the boss began. [Rudy] Giuliani and Bannon both tried to calm Trump down to no avail. ‘Am I a baby, Paul? You think you’re so f---ing smart! Like you’re a genius!” Trump apparently said. “’Well, you suck on TV.’ By the time the boss finished, Manafort looked like a crushed blue beer can. Even Bannon felt sorry for him.”

Perhaps the most timely section of that drama refers to an August 2016 encounter between Manafort and Bannon, when the former Breitbart chief visited him at his Trump Tower apartment to share details of a New York Times report revealing a $12.7 million payment from Ukraine.

Manafort, who had a woman lounging on his couch wearing a “white muumuu,” reportedly said the report was “’all lies.’”

The story published the following day revealed details that Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates “never disclosed their work as foreign agents as required under federal law.”

Lewandowski and Bossie recall Trump saying “’I’ve got a crook running my campaign,’” and further recall Trump requesting “Jared” [Kushner] fire him.

The book foreshadowed the current state of play for both Manafort and Gates, who were among the first charged in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign officials during the 2016 election. They have pleaded not guilty.

Lewandowski writes that the day Manafort became campaign chairman “has to be one of the worst of his life.”

“Because now the spotlight is directly on him,” Lewandowski writes. “And Paul never looked good under the lights – I think it’s all the Botox.""",politics
"Two Americans who were stabbed Friday night at a train station in Amsterdam were targeted by an Afghan citizen who had a “terrorist motive,” officials say.

City authorities said the 19-year-old suspect, identified only as Jawed S., appeared to target the American tourists in a stabbing attack at Central Station just after noon on Friday.

""Based on the suspect's first statements, he had a terrorist motive,"" the city administration said in a statement on Saturday. They did not elaborate on what the statements were or in what ways they might have shown intent.

Still, Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte doubled down on these claims after taking to Twitter to confirm that investigation was zeroing in the role played by extremist ideology.

Initial reports indicated that it did not appear to be a targeted attack, and that the victims did not appear to be chosen for a clear reason.

The victims were identified only as American citizens by the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands; police said they were recovering in a hospital with injuries that were considered serious but not life-threatening.

The suspect, who had a residency permit from Germany, was stopped by Dutch police officers when he was shot and wounded. He is scheduled to be arraigned during a closed-door hearing with an investigating judge on Monday. Officials have not disclosed the charges he could face.

"A Dallas official pleaded guilty Thursday to federal charges after prosecutors said he earned more than $450,000 in kickbacks and bribes in exchange for official actions taken to benefit local business dealings.

Democrat Dwaine Caraway, Dallas city council member and mayor pro tem, pleaded guilty in court to conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, as well as tax evasion, U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox announced in a news release.

The funds Caraway received were “in the form of a phony consulting agreement, luxury suits, fully funded trips, gambling money, repayment of personal debt, checks and cash” from Robert Leonard in return for taking action that benefited the latter’s business, the news release said, citing court documents.

Among the actions were “key votes to promote and continue” a program that put cameras on school buses -- a business to which Leonard's company had ties.

Leonard also pleaded guilty in court on Thursday to conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, the news release said.

“The pleas today represent the meticulous and tireless efforts of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the dedicated prosecutors of our office,” Cox said. “These cases demonstrate our continued resolve to uncover corruption at the highest levels--the citizens of Dallas deserve honest government.”

Caraway, the second highest-ranking elected official in Dallas, resigned from his post on the council, Cox announced.

Attorney Michael Payma, who is representing Caraway, told The Associated Press that the court documents speak for themselves. He said Caraway must still be sentenced, and he declined to comment further.

The investigation was carried out by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI).

"If current generic congressional polling numbers hold, Republicans will lose their majority in the House of Representatives in the Nov. 6 midterm elections – and a Democratic majority in the House will then likely vote to impeach President Trump. Republicans must start doing more now to prevent this nightmare scenario from becoming a reality.

Of course, impeachment by the House doesn’t mean President Trump will be moving back to Trump Tower. As one of the leaders of the House impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998, I know from personal experience that the Senate is under no obligation to convict a president after the House votes to impeach.

A two-thirds vote of the Senate – meaning 67 votes – is required to convict a president of impeachment charges and tell him, in effect: “You’re fired!”

Only 50 senators voted to convict President Clinton on one impeachment charges and 45 voted to convict him on another. Similarly, President Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House in 1868 but the Senate also failed to convict him.

But the high bar required for an impeachment conviction in the Senate shouldn’t prompt overconfidence by Republicans. It’s important for the GOP to step up the fight now to hold onto majorities in the House and Senate in November, and to prepare to fight the impeachment battle should Democrats become the majority party in the House and possibly the Senate as well.

Rather than scattering like rats leaving a sinking ship – as many Republican House members already have done by announcing they will not seek re-election – Republicans should be donning armor and girding for battle. So far, 40 GOP House members will not be seeking re-election in November, compared to only 20 Democrats

Too many Republicans appear hesitant to prepare for battle to save the Trump presidency before the dogs of war are unleashed.

Even if the midterm elections do not result in the “blue wave” for which Democrats pine, a bare majority of one Democratic House member will cost the GOP every committee chairmanship, the speakership, and control of the legislative agenda, in addition to making impeachment of President Trump more likely.

Up to now, the question of impeachment has resided on the ideological and financial fringes of the Democratic Party. The impeachment drive has been led by far-left Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters of California and billionaire Tom Steyer, who has spent millions of dollars on pro-impeachment TV ads. But so far, this effort to overturn the 2016 presidential election has not picked up strong grassroots support.

All that will change on Nov. 7 if the previous day’s voting confirms a House and possibly a Senate majority win for the Democrats. Democrats now serving as ranking members on every House committee – including Maxine Waters on Financial Services – will begin immediately to set in motion plans to give President Trump an eviction notice from the Oval Office.

Hopefully, this scenario will not come to pass. But the first midterm election results for the party occupying the White House are almost always bad.

The worst thing Republicans could do with so much at stake is to pretend the problem of losing their majority and seeing the Trump presidency end does not exist or will magically disappear.

The smarter course, which actually may improve the chances that Democrats fail in their effort to regain control of the House, is to meet the challenge of potential impeachment head-on. But that requires at the start an understanding of what impeachment is – and is not.

Even though our Founding Fathers clearly understood the need for a mechanism by which to remove a president from office before his term expires, the guidance they provided beyond the mechanics of such a move are slim.

Alexander Hamilton, one of the two principal authors of the Federalist Papers, described the impeachment process in his Essay No. 65 in broad-brush strokes as dealing with presidential “misconduct” that violated the “public trust” and was “political” nature. But he made clear that impeachment was not to be used by Congress to remove a president simply because it disagreed with the president politically.

A Democratic majority in the House would reject Hamilton’s wise counsel. Instead, Democrats would follow Steyer’s example and not bother with any historical or reasoned analysis of what constitutes a legitimate impeachment. They would concoct whatever it takes to justify President Trump’s removal.

Back in 1997, when I first called for an inquiry of impeachment regarding President Clinton, my action was based on evidence that Clinton had violated federal laws. Even though the actual articles of impeachment that passed the House in December 1998 were based on matters unknown to me in 1997, the fact remains that it was violations of federal law – perjury and obstruction of justice – and not personal behavior or political disagreements that formed the predicate for President Clinton’s impeachment.

This distinction between violations of law and differences of policy is critically important. It’s based on sound legal and historical analysis, and must be articulated repeatedly. If impeachment were a proceeding in a court of law, Democratic moves to impeach President Trump would have no legal ground to stand on, at least based on what we know so far.

But impeachment is not a neat and tidy legal proceeding governed by carefully crafted statutes and learned court opinions. A Democratic majority controlling the House would have no trouble claiming that some amorphous connection between Trump and someone with a Russian-sounding name – or a presidential tweet that criticized a Justice Department lawyer – satisfied the criteria for “high crimes and misdemeanors” justifying impeachment.

The impeachment game is already well underway, regardless of whether the Republican leadership cares to acknowledge the fact. And if the GOP refuses to suit up and take to the field now, the final score becomes distressingly predictable and unpleasant.

Perhaps the strangest aspect to this, however, is that the Republican leadership does not even seem to recognize who their opponent is. As noted by veteran conservative writer Richard Viguerie late last month in his flagship online newspaper, Conservative HQ, House GOP leaders cling to the absurd belief that it is conservatives who are causing the party’s poll numbers to dip.

If the GOP leadership really believes its chances to retain control of the House rise or fall based not on how vigorously it fights Democrats and that party’s agenda – but on whether it can rein in conservatives within the GOP – it will doom Republicans to significant losses in November and dramatically increase the chances that President Trump will be impeached.

If, on the other hand, Republicans focus on drawing clear and actual distinctions between themselves and those who seek to wrest the House majority from them, the dynamics change dramatically in their favor. Such a strategy – given the will to pursue it – is relatively simple, even in the context of an opposition party clearly intent on impeaching the Republican president.

First of all, the GOP should reject the oft-quoted but largely misunderstood notion, attributed to former Speaker Tip O’Neill, D-Mass., that “all politics is local.”

Trump’s astonishing 2016 victory had nothing to do with “local” politics. Neither did Ronald Reagan’s in 1980. The tsunami that swept four decades of Democratic control out of the House in 1994 also had little to do with “local” issues; it had everything to do with broad, national issues like gun control and tax reform. History is fairly clear on this score – the Republicans win when the elections focus on national issues.

Even if Republican leaders refuse to learn from President Trump’s 2016 winning game plan, all they have to do is consider the issues on which the grassroots supports him now. Trump’s agenda is a national agenda; it presents a clear and distinct break with that of the Democratic Party.

The president favors true immigration reform – Democrats don’t. The president supports freeing businesses from strangling regulations that hamper the market – Democrats don’t. The president supports local control of schools – Democrats don’t. And the president wants you to pay less in taxes – the Democrats want you to pay a lot more. There are plenty of other examples of differences between President Trump and Democrats.

These issues, and many others, are clear winners for Republicans in the House. They should be vocally advocated in both legislation as well as in political arenas.

Republicans need not fawn over every Trump tweet. But it would seem to be a no-brainer to support the president’s agenda openly, and to back him up in the House through legislative actions, spending bills reflective of that agenda, and strong opposition to Democratic moves trying to undo his regulatory reform.

If House Republicans do all this – while also drawing attention to the manner in which the Democrats are waving the impeachment flag wildly and in a manner clearly designed to overturn what Hillary Clinton lost for them two years ago – the Republicans may regain their fighting edge and maintain a majority that right now is slipping through their fingers.",politics
"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemingly failed to gain a single concession from North Korea after meetings Friday and Saturday in the communist nation’s capital of Pyongyang to discuss America’s demand that the North get rid its nuclear weapons.

In fact, it seems both sides can’t even agree on what was discussed or how the talks went, with the North now even threatening to walk away from its vague pledge to denuclearize.

Following Pompeo’s talks with high-ranking North Korean government official Kim Yong Chol, North Korea accused the Trump administration of making a “unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization” that was “deeply regrettable.”

In marked contrast, Pompeo called the talks “productive” and said: “These are complicated issues, but we made progress on almost all of the central issues.” However, Pompeo did not specify what progress was made.

Tellingly, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un – who rules with an iron fist and is the only one with the power to approve substantive concessions to the U.S. – did not even meet with Pompeo Friday or Saturday, although he has met with Pompeo before. That alone is evidence that Pompeo walked away from the talks largely emptyhanded.

This disappointing trip by the secretary of state can only mean one thing: The Trump administration has reached the same point that every other U.S. administration – Democrat and Republican – has reached with North Korea. When negotiations get to the point where North Korea must make concessions on its nuclear program that are substantive, officials from the North cry foul – and walk away.

Kim Jong Un seems to be carrying on a tradition in international relations begun by his grandfather and father, who ruled North Korea before him: lie, lie and lie again – and drag out talks with adversaries as long as possible without making any real concessions.

Mike Pompeo is not naive. In fact, the New York Times reported Saturday: “Privately, Mr. Pompeo has said that he doubts Mr. Kim will ever give up his nuclear weapons. And those doubts have been reinforced in recent days by intelligence showing that North Korea, far from dismantling its weapons facilities, has been expanding them and taking steps to conceal the efforts from the United States.”

North Korea is truly the land of lousy options. I fear we are headed right back to the brink with North Korea, all over again.

All this places the Trump administration in an awful bind. Clearly, we have reached a fork in the road when it comes to our dealings with Kim Jong Un that is looking more and more like a dead end.

After countless mid- and lower-level contacts between U.S. and North Korean officials, three sets of face-to-face talks between Pompeo and North Korean officials – and a historic summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore June 12 – America has received nothing but an ambiguous statement signed by Kim and President Trump in Singapore.

In that statement Kim reaffirmed his past pledge to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” without even defining what that means.

President Trump made a major concession simply by meeting with Kim, and then by halting joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea – a long-sought North Korean goal.

Once again, Pyongyang is following its tried and true diplomatic playbook of pocketing concessions and stalling for time.

This is where things get hard and the stakes jump dramatically. For there are only three possible paths for the Trump administration now, all of which are unappealing.

Option 1: A full U.S. military assault on North Korea to rid the world of Kim’s weapons of mass destruction.

Clearly, as I have laid out in these pages on several occasions, this a very risky gambit. There is virtually no way even our superpower-sized military can guarantee the destruction of as many as 65 nuclear weapons that North Korea is believed to possess.

North Korea’s nukes are scattered around the country and likely deep underground – so they can’t be destroyed in one bombing raid on a single target.

Following a U.S. attack on the North, Kim would have every incentive to counterattack with whatever nuclear weapons he has left – as well as his countless tons of chemical and as biological weapons. That would ensure that Seoul, Tokyo and maybe even Hawaii and major cities on America’s West Coast become the largest graveyards in human history.

This option if so horrific it is unlikely to be used by the U.S.

Option 2: A U.S. policy of containment of North Korea on steroids, or what the Trump administration called “maximum pressure.”

The idea of this option would be to cut North Korea off from the world diplomatically and economically.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley would call for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, demanding a full export ban on North Korea, as well as the halting of all natural resources (such as oil) going to the North.

Unfortunately, the maximum pressure campaign could be tough to put back in place, because it would be completely dependent on China, which is not exactly happy with the Trump administration these days after President Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese imports and launched a trade war Friday.

With 90 percent or more of North Korea’s exports rolling through China in one form or another, it seems highly unlikely that Beijing has any incentive to help Washington.

China will now use North Korea as a bargaining chip on trade and perhaps even other disputes it has with the U.S. and other nations – such as Chinese territorial claims to Taiwan and parts of the South China Sea and East China Sea.

And there is already evidence to suggest Beijing won’t enforce existing sanctions on North Korea for long – and might already have started to pull back.

Option 3: Accepting North Korea as a nuclear power and moving on to deal with the bigger threat of containing China.

Since America already deals with other nations that have nuclear weapons – Russia, China, Britain, France, India, Pakistan and Israel – reality may dictate that we must reluctantly accept North Korea as a member of the nuclear club.

President Trump would surely be attacked on the right for being soft and on the left for changing his position if he accepts North Korean nukes, but doing this would allow the U.S. to increase its diplomatic efforts all over Asia to push back against the growth of Chinese power.

Also, with the nuclear issue removed and Kim Jong Un feeling secure – knowing that his regime has the ultimate insurance policy in place – many of the other security challenges the North poses to the U.S. could be settled once and for all.

For example, a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War – halted by an armistice in 1953 – could be signed.

There could be major arms control agreements signed limiting the size, scope and scale of North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, with international inspectors on the ground to ensure any promises made are promises kept.

The U.S. and South Korea could even remove economic sanctions on North Korea, allowing billions of dollars of investment to flow into the North. This might allow America and its allies a greater say in Pyongyang’s affairs – and maybe even dilute Beijing’s control.

But this all comes at a price. Accepting a nuclear North Korea could set off an arms race in the region, with Japan and South Korea possibly someday opting for their own nuclear weapons arsenals and increased missile defenses platforms. This could make China nervous, ensuring Beijing builds up its atomic arsenal and missile defenses as well.

Clearly, as many Asia hands love to point out, North Korea is truly the land of lousy options. We know one thing for certain: when it comes to Kim Jong Un, nothing is certain. Even after the Trump administration made important concessions, the North does not seem any closer to giving up its nukes.

I fear we are headed right back to the brink with North Korea, all over again.",world

"For the first time in more than a year, Iran test-fired a ballistic missile in a brazen display of defiance months after President Trump pulled the United States out of a landmark nuclear deal and days before his administration slapped new sanctions on the Islamic Republic, three U.S. officials with knowledge of the launch tell Fox News.

The test of an Iranian Fateh-110 short-range ballistic missile coincided with a large-scale naval exercise by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard forces late last week involving over 50 small gunboats in the Strait of Hormuz to rehearse “swarm” tactics which could one day potentially shut down the vital waterway, through which 30 percent of the world’s oil passes each year.

While the U.S. military publicly acknowledged the naval activity, the missile test from an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps base in Bandar-e-Jask in southeastern Iran has not been previously reported. The launch was detected by U.S. spy satellites.

According to the officials, the anti-ship Fateh-110 Mod 3 flew over 100 miles on a flight path over the Strait of Hormuz to a test range in the Iranian desert. “It was shore-to-shore,” said one U.S. official describing the launch, who like the others requested anonymity to discuss sensitive information.

There were no U.S. military assets nearby or in danger when Iran conducted the test, the official added. The guided-missile destroyer USS The Sullivans has been escorting vessels through the strait in recent days.

A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment on the Iranian ballistic missile launch.

Last week’s missile launch is the first known test of the Fateh-110 in over a year since a pair were launched on consecutive days in March 2017. One of the missiles last year destroyed a floating barge roughly 155 miles away, two U.S. officials said at the time.

The top American commander for U.S. forces in the Middle East told reporters Iran’s recent naval activity was meant to “send a message” to the United States.

""I think it's pretty clear to us that they were trying to use that exercise to send a message to us that as we approach this period of the sanctions, they had some capabilities,"" Gen. Joseph Votel said at the Pentagon Wednesday.

It’s not immediately clear if the missile test occurred Thursday or Friday, but U.S. officials say it occurred as part of Iran’s annual naval exercise, moved up from its typical fall timeframe ahead of the new sanctions imposed this week. “It’s routine to see Iran doing a missile test during this annual drill,” one official said.

Earlier this week, John Bolton, President Trump’s national security adviser, said the new U.S. sanctions placed on Iran Tuesday were meant to pressure the government in Tehran over its military activity in the Middle East and its ballistic missile program.

In an interview on Fox News, Bolton said the new sanctions targeting Iran’s automotive and airline sectors were not to bring about “regime change” in Iran despite dozens of protests taking place throughout the country and its currency losing value.

U.N. resolution 2231 -- put in place days after the Iran nuclear deal was signed -- calls on the Islamic Republic not to conduct ballistic missile tests. The resolution bars Iran from conducting ballistic missile tests for eight years and went into effect July 20, 2015.

But critics say the resolution leaves wiggle room by saying Iran is “called upon” not forbidden from carrying out such tests.

Iran is ""called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology,"" according to the text of the resolution.

Despite this most recent example of Iranian saber rattling, its notable Iran has not harassed any U.S. warships or aircraft in nearly a year. The last unsafe interaction occurred nearly a year ago on Aug. 14, 2017, when an Iranian drone flew too close to an F/A-18 Hornet attempting to land aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, according to the Navy.

Last September, Iranian state television aired footage of a ballistic missile launch of what Tehran described as a new type of medium-range ballistic missile hours after displaying the missile in a parade in Tehran, but the missile launch turned out to be fake and copy of a failed launch the previous January, according to U.S. officials.

The failed late January launch was first reported by Fox News and prompted the White House to put Iran “on notice” days later.

A year earlier, Iranian forces captured the crew of two small U.S. Navy patrol boats that strayed into Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf. The 10 American sailors were released roughly a day later.",world
"The recent arrest of two Iranian agents alleged to have been running spy operations on U.S. soil is just ""the tip of the iceberg"" in terms of the Islamic Republic's efforts to conduct intelligence operations in America that could result in a terrorist attack, according to a leading lawmaker and U.S. officials who spoke to the Washington Free Beacon about the matter.

Following the arrest of two Iranian individuals charged with spying on Jewish and Israeli facilities in the California area, Rep. Peter Roskam (R., Ill.) told the Free Beacon it is likely Iran has stationed multiple regime-tied agents in the United States to conduct intelligence operations.

While the arrest of the two Iranians was met with shock in the press, Roskam said he was not surprised by the arrests, which have unearthed concrete evidence of the Islamic Republic's efforts to foment discord across the globe, including on American soil.

""This is the tip of the iceberg,"" Roskam said in an interview. ""This is not a surprise and this is a result of the Iran regime getting financial support from the Obama administration in the Iran deal.""

Iran has been emboldened by the lack of international repercussions on its malevolent behavior and may have increased its intelligence operations in America in the years since the landmark nuclear deal, he said.

Saraki, Nigeria's third most senior politician, late last month defected from the ruling All Progressives Congress party to the opposition People's Democratic Party, which he left four years ago. He met with former president and Buhari rival Goodluck Jonathan on Wednesday.

Days after Saraki's defection, Nigeria's political turmoil led to a dramatic standoff in the National Assembly early this month as agents of the Department of State Services prevented lawmakers from entering. Saraki called it ""an act of cowardice by those seeking to carry out an illegal impeachment of the leadership of the Senate.""

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, acting as president while Buhari was again in Britain, quickly fired the head of Nigeria's intelligence agency.

"Iran has signed a deal to rebuild Syria's armed forces, which have been depleted by more than seven years civil war, Iranian Defense Minister Amir Hatami said on Monday.

Hatami, on a two-day visit to Syria, told the Beirut-based al-Mayadeen TV station that the agreement also stipulates helping rebuild Syria's military industry.

The announcement comes as the U.S. under President Donald Trump shifts is toughening its stance on Iran's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad's government, which has weathered a calamitous civil war.

The White House has demanded that Iran extract itself from Syria as an essential precondition to lifting sanctions that went into effect earlier this month.

Israel has also been critical of Iran's expanding role in Syria, saying it won't tolerate a permanent Iranian military presence near its frontiers.

Iran has been an essential backer of Syria's government in the civil war now in its seventh year, providing advisers, military supplies, training and thousands of militiamen to fight alongside the Syrian army.

Hatami said Iran was in Syria at the invitation of the government.

The precise details of the agreement were not announced.

The Syrian government does not release casualty numbers, but monitoring groups say the government has lost tens of thousands of fighters since the civil war broke out in 2011.

Iran and Russia both intervened on behalf of the government as opposition forces gained ground in the early years of the war.

Assad, who has ruled with an iron fist since inheriting the presidency from his father in 2000, now looks safe in his post but he rules over a shattered country.

At least 400,000 people have been killed in the war, according to monitoring groups, and the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia estimates the economic damage to the country at over $300 bn.

The government and its international backers have described the conflict as a war against terrorism and enemies abroad, chiefly the U.S. and other western nations.

Hatami said Syria's government is now in a stronger position and warned against any ""foreign aggression"" against Syria.",world
"Michael Cohen lawyer Lanny Davis on Wednesday mistakenly promoted a nonexistent website where he said supporters could donate to his client's legal fund -- but the site didn't stay dormant for long.

It now redirects to President Trump campaign website donaldjtrump.com, which urges visitors to contribute to re-elect the president and ""Make America Great Again.""

""I know that when [Cohen] retained me, as recently as yesterday, he's committed to telling the truth, and we've actually set up a website with the name 'truth' in it, called michaelcohentruth.com,"" Davis told Fox News' ""America's Newsroom"" on Wednesday. ""And he's looking for help from people who want to give donations to help him tell the truth.""

Davis repeated the inaccurate website address later in the interview, saying that Cohen ""has gone through a lot, his family has suffered, he's in financial distress -- we've set up a Gofundme site, called michaelcohentruth.com, and we're hoping that people who want him to tell the truth about Donald Trump will contribute to that site.""

That website was inactive at the time of Davis' comment early Wednesday, but was snatched up quickly. Publicly available information about the domain name's registration hides the owner of the website through a proxy service, but reveals that the URL was purchased on Wednesday.

A Trump campaign official denied involvement in a statement to Fox News, saying anyone could have purchased the nonexistent address Davis mentioned and rerouted it to Trump's homepage for as little as $7.

LEGAL EXPERTS WEIGH IN: HOW DOES COHEN'S BOMBSHELL GUILTY PLEA AFFECT TRUMP?

Davis apparently intended to provide a slightly different website address, which as of late afternoon links to a Gofundme page that has raised more than $50,000 for Cohen out of a $500,000 goal.

""Michael decided to put his family and his country first,"" the Gofundme page says. ""Now Michael needs your financial help -- to pay his legal fees. The Michael Cohen Truth Fund is a transparent trust account, with all donations going to help Michael Cohen and his family as he goes forward on his journey to tell the truth about Donald Trump.""

Cohen becomes the latest in a string of former Trump administration insiders who have resorted to fundraising amid mounting legal troubles, including FBI Deputy Director Andy McCabe and agent Peter Strzok, who were both fired after internal reviews found that they had violated the agency's policies.

FIRED FBI AGENT PETER STRZOK SETS UP ANTI-TRUMP TWITTER ACCOUNT, GOFUNDME

News that Cohen had reached a deal with federal prosecutors in which he implicated Trump in potential campaign finance violations rocked Washington, D.C. on Tuesday. Cohen, as part of a guilty plea agreement, said that he had made illegally large hush money contributions at the direction of a candidate for federal office, raising the possibility that Trump could have conspired to break campaign finance law.

For his part, Trump has played down Cohen's plea, saying in a series of tweets that campaign finance laws are rarely prosecuted at the criminal level, and are often handled as civil matters -- unless politics gets involved.

""Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime,"" Trump wrote on Twitter Wednesday. ""President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!""

That was an apparent reference to a nearly $400,000 fine issued in 2013 by the Federal Election Commission against Obama's 2008 presidential campaign for a slew of administrative violations.

Trump also wrote: ""If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen!""

Davis, a longtime Democratic operative who had served as special counsel to former President Bill Clinton, was mum as to whether Cohen had any knowledge about alleged criminal collusion between Trump officials and the Russian government.

""I'm not going to answer questions until Mr. Mueller is finished with his investigation,"" Davis said, referring to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Davis added that there's ""no question"" that Trump had committed a federal campaign finance violation, and suggested it would be legally permissible for prosecutors to indict the president.

"A top U.N. expert is taking aim at the Trump administration’s efforts to tighten the screws on Iran’s theocratic regime, saying that U.S. sanctions are “illegitimate” and are driving Iranians into poverty.

The Trump administration has been criticized by members of both the U.N. and E.U. leaders for its decision this month to reimpose sanctions of the Islamic regime. The sanctions targeted Iran’s financial, automotive and precious metals industries and will also target its oil and banking system in November.

A senior administration official told Fox News this month that the restored sanctions are designed to constrict the revenue Iran uses to fund “terrorists, dictators, proxy militias, and the regime’s own cronies.”

TRUMP REINSTATES IRAN SANCTIONS, SLAMS 'HORRIBLE' NUCLEAR DEAL

But Idriss Jazairy a former Algerian ambassador who was appointed by the controversial U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC) as the special rapporteur “on the negative impact of the unilateral coercive measures on enjoyment of human rights,” chose to direct his criticism at the U.S.

“The reimposition of sanctions against Iran after the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, which had been unanimously adopted by the Security Council with the support of the U.S. itself, lays bare the illegitimacy of this action,” he said in the statement published Wednesday.

“International sanctions must have a lawful purpose, must be proportional, and must not harm the human rights of ordinary citizens, and none of these criteria is met in this case.”

The U.S. withdrew from the Human Rights Council this year, describing it as a “cesspool of political bias.” John Bolton said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday that the U.S. will pull funding for the Council and the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR.)

Jazairy went onto claim that sanctions are driving millions into poverty.

“These unjust and harmful sanctions are destroying the economy and currency of Iran, driving millions of people into poverty and making imported goods unaffordable,” he said.

IRAN PLOTS TERROR ON EUROPEAN SOIL AS EU TRIES TO SHIELD REGIME FROM TRUMP SANCTIONS PUSH

Jazairy’s statement infuriated Iranian dissidents, as well as some analysts, who said that he should be pointing his finger at the Iranian dictatorship rather than the U.S.

""What has broken the backbone of the Iranian economy is the consequence of the policies of the Iranian regime and institutionalized corruption, which has nothing to do with the sanctions,"" Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) told Fox News.

Iranian analyst Heshmat Alavi meanwhile raised the question of Iran's actions in Syria and said that Iran is spending ""billions"" there.

""Jazairy also won't tell you that #Iran intends to spend even more on reconstructing #Syria, not providing for ordinary Iranians back home,"" he tweeted.

Behnam Ben Taleblu a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) in Washington D.C, told Fox News that Jazairy’s views are out of touch with the Iranian people -- who are blaming their own government rather than the U.S.

“To paraphrase and borrow from the [Trump] administration, there is not a group that has suffered more at the hands of the regime in Tehran than the Iranian people. Iranian protesters, who chastise their own government and not the U.S. for their plight, rightly understand this.” He continued, “One only wishes that the U.N. system did too.”

Hillel Neuer, the executive director of the Swiss-based UN Watch -- an independent human rights monitoring group -- told Fox News that Iran was the country that sponsored the resolution on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement in 2014 that created the position that Jazairy now holds.

“That Jazairy serves as an expert of the UNHRC illustrates the moral corruption of the UNHRC, and underscores why U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley was absolutely right to call out the utter failure of the discredited council to reform itself.”

Jazairy’s comments come on the back of a statement from E.U. leaders, who said they “deeply regret” the U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions.

“The lifting of nuclear-related sanctions is an essential part of the deal,” E.U. High Representative Federica Mogherini, along with French, German and British foreign ministers, said in a joint statement, vowing to “protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran.”

In his statement, Jazairy applauded the opposition from the E.U.

“I am grateful for the efforts of the European Union in tackling this injustice, both through diplomatic efforts and through legislation to protect European companies from American sanctions. I sincerely hope that the international community can come together to see that the world does not become a battleground for generalized economic war,” he said.

But the administration has shrugged off the criticism, and is doubling down on its tough stance against the regime. Last week Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the creation of the Iran Action Group, which will direct, review and coordinate all aspects of Iran policy.

“Our hope is that one day soon we can reach a new agreement with Iran. But we must see major changes in the regime’s behavior both inside and outside of its borders,” he said in remarks at the State Department. “The Iranian people and the world are demanding that Iran finally act like a normal nation.”

"President Trump took full credit and proclaimed victory for Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson in a special U.S. House election in Ohio Tuesday, though the tight race remained too close to call. Balderson also claimed victory.

The Republican candidate led Democrat Danny O’Connor, the Franklin County recorder of deeds, by 1,754 votes, with all precincts reporting. However, nearly 8,500 provisional and absentee ballots remained to be reviewed. That won’t happen until Aug. 18. A recount would be mandatory if the winner at that point is ahead by less than one-half of 1 percent.

President Trump tweeted Tuesday night: “When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson, he was down in early voting 64 to 36. That was not good. After my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better. Now Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. He will win BIG in Nov.”

Regardless of the final outcome of the special election, Balderson and O’Connor will face each other in the Nov. 6 general election for a full two-year term in the House.

The president’s claim that he gave Balderson a boost is very plausible. But in addition, Republicans in general clearly outspent Democrats in a bid hold the district in the Columbus area that Trump carried by 11 points in the 2016 presidential election.

House Speaker Paul Ryan’s super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, spent $3 million on the congressional race, sending volunteers to knock on 600,000 doors.

Scott Ryan, a GOP state legislator who is no relation to the House speaker, said he was pleased that it looked like his party would hold the seat. But he admitted to the Columbus Dispatch that “the fact that this is close is certainly not what we were hoping for.”

Ohio native Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said the GOP’s narrow lead in the special election “is very much in line with what we’ve seen all over the country in special elections this cycle: Democrats often running well ahead of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 performance.”

The reason Republicans have to worry about the special election results of the past year or so is that they are defending 42 districts in November without the advantage of having an incumbent in the race. If Republicans win a clear majority of those open seats, they keep the House. If they don’t, there will be a Democratic speaker elected for the first time since 2009.

Tuesday’s primary results in states other than Ohio give Democrats hope they will make gains in November.

Unions in Missouri were able to put a referendum on that state’s ballot challenging a new GOP-passed law ending the requirement that union membership be compulsory. Public employee unions flexed their muscle, and the GOP “right to work” law went down to a 2 to 1 defeat.

But it was in Washington state that the clearest storm warnings were spotted in Tuesday’s primary. That state uses an unusual “jungle primary” system in which all candidates regardless of party appear on the same ballot.

Historically, the totals that each party’s candidates post in the primary come close to the partisan division in the November election. Because of the state’s open primary, it has been said that Washington’s primary often functions like a high-participation poll.

On that basis, Republicans weren’t happy with Tuesday’s results. In three key congressional races for seats currently held by Republicans, the total vote for the GOP was below 50 percent. That’s a clear sign of tough, competitive races this fall.

In Spokane, for example, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the No. 4 Republican in House leadership, only narrowly edged out Democratic opponent Lisa Brown.

“Republicans lost ground in state legislative primaries as well,” Seattle talk-show host and 2000 GOP candidate for governor John Carlson told me. “They can bounce back in November but it will be a knockdown, drag out fight.”

The reason for the GOP angst is simple. President Trump’s policies now often poll favorably with a majority or near-majority of the voters, but his personal ratings hurt his party with swing voters.

Political handicapper Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report says that this fall the GOP will pay a “Trump penalty,” which he defines as the price Trump and his party are paying for the president’s “modus operandi.”

President Trump himself has decided that if he has become the issue for many voters, then so be it. Expect to see him continue as the center of attention in this fall’s campaign. That will make the November election an up-or-down referendum on the president – and that apparently is exactly the way he likes it.",politics
"An emaciated Oklahoma teen was reportedly “within a week of death” Thursday when cops found him living in his well-fed family’s barn — where he said he’d been surviving on a diet of sticks, leaves and grass for nearly two years.

Now four members of the teen's family are behind bars, on child neglect charges, Oklahoma City's FOX 25 reported.

The 15-year-old boy weighed 80 pounds when authorities found him last Thursday in the barn along with goats, rabbits and chickens following a tip from a concerned passerby, the Oklahoman reported.

“We’re incredibly thankful that someone called. ... They literally saved this child’s life,” Adam Panter, Pottawatomie/Lincoln County first assistant district attorney, told the Shawnee News-Star. “He could have died and been buried on that property and no one would have ever known.”

“We’re incredibly thankful that someone called. ... They literally saved this child’s life. He could have died and been buried on that property and no one would have ever known.” - Adam Panter, Pottawatomie/Lincoln County first assistant district attorney

The boy’s father, stepmother and two older brothers were arrested on child neglect warrants and booked into jail the following day.

Those arrested were identified as Jimmy Jones Sr., 34; Amy Jones, 46; Johnathan Plank, 20; and Tyler Adkins, 24, FOX 25 reported.

""He was malnourished and had suffered abuse,"" Panter told the Oklahoman about the teen. ""Doctors said he was within a week of death.""

The boy told authorities that his father had shot him in a leg with a 12-gauge shotgun about a year ago, according to the paper. He also had a head injury, which become infected with maggots, he told authorities.

The boy’s father dug out the maggots and used glue to close the wound, the paper reported, citing an affidavit. The boy said he wasn’t allowed to leave the property for approximately two years.

Authorities said despite the boy being underweight, the rest of the family appeared well-fed.

One of the boy’s brothers said the 15-year-old was not allowed to sleep in the house, and could only go into the residence to use the bathroom, the paper reported, citing an affidavit.

The boy was taken to a hospital where was in fair condition, the paper reported.

The boy’s stepmother told investigators she didn’t realize the extent of her son’s malnourishment, but acknowledged he should have been given medical attention, according to the paper. Investigators also found proof of insurance, despite the woman’s claim that they didn’t have any.

A spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services declined to comment on the case to the paper.",world
"A former Trump campaign co-chairman shared details to Fox News on Tuesday night about a meeting he had with an individual who he now believes was an FBI informant.

Sam Clovis spoke out to “Tucker Carlson Tonight” amid reports the alleged FBI informant was in touch with members of the Trump campaign team during the 2016 presidential election.

Clovis told Carlson that prior to the meeting on Sept. 1, 2016, the alleged informant emailed him asking for a sit-down to discuss foreign policy and to share some writings which might help the campaign.

The meeting in Washington D.C. lasted about an hour and the pair discussed the individual’s research “and it mostly was focused on China,” Clovis said.

WEB OF INFORMANT CONTACTS WITH TRUMP CAMPAIGN EXPANDS, FUELING GOP PRESSURE ON FBI

Weeks later, Clovis told Carlson, he received an email from the alleged informant that contained “several attachments.”

“And I can be honest with you, Tucker, I haven’t even opened those attachments to this day,” Clovis said. “I have no idea what was in them but they were mostly titled, ‘papers that dealt with China.’”

Clovis said he did not know the individual before getting the initial email. He said the alleged informant claimed to know Carter Page, who also was part of Trump’s campaign team.

It wasn’t until recent reporting that Clovis said he “started to put two and two together.”

“And then it started to make sense to me,” Clovis said, that the individual may have been “probing to find a weak spot in our campaign.”

ANOTHER ‘INFORMANT’ ATTEMPTED TO INFILTRATE TRUMP CAMPAIGN UNDER OBAMA, CAMPAIGN AIDE SAYS

“Someone who might be vulnerable to connecting things back to those elusive 30,000 emails that supposedly the Russians had,” Clovis said, adding that he thought the alleged informant’s task was “to create an audit trail back to those emails from someone in the campaign or someone associated with the campaign so that they could develop a stronger case for probable cause to continue to issue warrants and to further an investigation.”

“Because I really felt after hearing all of these other things and listening to the reports that I’ve read, that this truly was an effort to build something that did not exist,” Clovis said.

When Carlson asked Clovis why he never read the email attachments, he replied that he “was busy” and because he “didn’t think that they were going to contribute anything.”

He continued, “I’ve gone back and reviewed all my emails. I didn’t report that meeting to anyone in the campaign so the meeting was of no consequence to me as far as anything I can remember. And I’ve looked through all of my personal emails and everything, and I can’t find a record of it at all.”

Fox News reported earlier Tuesday that the alleged informant spoke with Clovis, in addition to Carter Page and foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulous.

A source told Fox News' John Roberts that Clovis met with the alleged informant, whom he knew to be a professor, and had a conversation related to China. The source told Fox News that Russia did not come up.

The source told Fox News that Clovis received a follow-up email from the individual in the months before the election with research material on China, and another email on the day after the election congratulating the campaign.

"The Department of Justice filed a request Thursday to modify a 1997 order that limits the amount of time children can be detained in an attempt to end family separations at the border.

After an outpouring of criticism over the separation of children from their families who illegally enter the U.S., President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to end the controversial practice.

However, the executive action conflicts directly with a 1997 order known commonly as the Flores Agreement that states that children cannot be detained for longer than 20 days with adults.

In an attempt to avoid potential lawsuits, the DOJ filed a motion Thursday to “provide limited exemption” from the agreement, while Congress draws up a more suitable and long term solution.

“This Court should provide limited emergency relief in two respects. First, the Court should provide a limited exemption from its construction of the Flores Settlement Agreement's release provisions so that ICE may detain alien minors who have arrived with their parent or legal guardian together in ICE family residential facilities,” a press release from the DOJ read.

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO STOP FAMILY SEPERATION AT BORDER

The second modification asks the Court to exempt ICE family residential facilities from “state licensure requirements.”

While only a short term solution, the DOJ requested the changes because circumstances have changed since the original order was filed.

“These changes are justified by several material changes in circumstances--including the ongoing and worsening influx of families unlawfully entering the United States at the southwest border,” the statement said.

The Flores Agreement dates back to several lawsuits that were filed against the U.S. government over the treatment of unaccompanied minors under its care.

The final order in 1997 required that children only be released to their parents or legal guardian and that they be placed in the least restrictive conditions. These stipulations that have become a major factor in family separations at the border.

Trump has said that it is loopholes like this that make proper immigration reform impossible and the government is simply enforcing the laws as they are.

WATCH: EXECUTIVE IMMIGRATION ORDER: WHY DEMS ARE SLAMMING TRUMP

With Congress unable to come to a quick fix, the president has stepped in to resolve the family separations. In addition to Wednesday’s executive order, Trump held a Cabinet meeting at the White House to further discuss immigration reform.

Fox News also learned Thursday from two defense officials that the Pentagon will support an HHS request to find housing and supply bedding for 20,000 migrant children.

It remains unknown where the children will be based.

"President Trump on Saturday evening appeared to signal that he may be rethinking a plan he announced last week to cancel a proposed 2.1 percent pay raise for federal workers.

The president retweeted a Twitter message posted earlier Saturday by Republican U.S. Senate candidate Corey Stewart of Virginia, in which Stewart wrote that federal workers had endured ""8 years of hell under Obama, with several rounds of pay freezes and benefit cuts.""

Trump ""can fix this, and I trust that he will,"" Stewart wrote.

Just one day earlier, Stewart -- typically a staunch Trump supporter -- had emailed a statement criticizing the pay-freeze plan that Trump disclosed Thursday.

""Federal workers endured 8 years of hell under Obama, with several rounds of pay freezes and benefit cuts ... [President Trump] can fix this, and I trust that he will."" - Corey Stewart, Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Virginia

“I almost never differ with President Trump, but in this case I do,” Stewart said in the statement, according to the Washington Post.

“Federal employees in Virginia wake up early, face punishing traffic and work hard to serve their nation and support their families,” the statement continued. “These workers need and deserve a pay raise.”

Another Virginia Republican, U.S. Rep. Barbara Comstock, also spoke out against Trump's plan.

""We cannot balance the budget on the backs of our federal employees and I will work with my House and Senate colleagues to keep the pay increase in our appropriations measures that we vote on in September,” Comstock said last week, according to the Hill.

""We cannot balance the budget on the backs of our federal employees and I will work with my House and Senate colleagues to keep the pay increase in our appropriations measures that we vote on in September.” - U.S. Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va.

The Democratic National Committee also derided Trump’s proposed pay freeze as “another slap in the face to American workers.”

At a Friday appearance in North Carolina, it appeared that Trump may have given the comments some consideration.

“I’m going to be doing a little work over the [Labor Day] weekend,” Trump said, according to a White House transcript cited by the Hill. “I’m going to be studying, you know, the federal workers in Washington that you’ve been reading so much about. People don’t want to give them any increase. They haven’t had one in a long time.

“I’m going to be doing a little work over the [Labor Day] weekend. I’m going to be studying, you know, the federal workers in Washington that you’ve been reading so much about. People don’t want to give them any increase. They haven’t had one in a long time."" - President Trump

""I said, I’m going to study that over the weekend. It’s a good time to study it -- Labor Day. Let’s see how they do next week. But a lot of people were against it. I’m going to take a good hard look over the weekend.""

In a letter Thursday to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate president pro tempore Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Trump had said that current agency budgets could not sustain additional pay for federal employees.

“We must maintain efforts to put our Nation on a fiscally sustainable course,” Trump wrote, explaining his opposition to raising salaries.

“[B]oth across-the-board pay increases and locality pay increases will be set at zero,” for 2019, the president wrote. He added that “Federal employee pay must be performance-based, and aligned strategically toward recruiting, retaining, and rewarding high-performing Federal employees and those with critical skill sets.”

But by Saturday it seemed the president may soon alter the plan he proposed Thursday.

Stewart on Nov. 6 is looking to defeat incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat who was Hillary Clinton's running mate in the 2016 presidential election. But Kaine has a 23-point lead in a Virginia Commonwealth University poll, the Hill reported.

"In the once terror-teeming city of Karachi on the coast of Pakistan’s Sindh province, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a name some hold in esteem.

“We learned from New York. The zero-tolerance policy and the application of the rule of law – that nobody is above the law – was key,” Muhammad Zubair, the Governor of Sindh and former Chairman of the Pakistan Privatization Committee, recently told Fox News, referencing Giuliani’s 1990’s crime clampdown in New York. “Karachi was so bad for two decades with warlords in the streets and a mess so deep that foreigners wouldn’t even come here for a day. And our number one, proudest achievement today has been turning Karachi around.”

The violence in Karachi was in a league of its own. The megacity – stuffed with around 25 million inhabitants and infamous as the place the Taliban captured and beheaded Wall Street Journal reporter Danny Pearl in 2002 – seethed with drug smuggling, kidnapping, extortion and daily bomb blasts. Sectarian street clans waged war with hardline Islamic gangs, and it was commonplace for elected political parties to also have their own armed militia wing.

In 2013, Karachi ranked – as per the World Atlas – as the sixth most dangerous city in the world. Other rankings had it even higher. But by 2018, it was listed past 50th. So what was the magic bullet?

“In 2013, I made the economic plan and a major part of that plan was doing whatever was possible from a law and order standpoint,” Zubair explained. “The Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the Army Chief knew that a brutal operation was the only way out of this mess.”

Pakistani officials decided that instead of using military units or the then-relatively weak local police force, the roughly 30,000-strong Karachi paramilitary security apparatus known as the Rangers would lead the charge. Although they had been in effect since the 1990s, the Rangers had little legal authority to use force. But laws were quickly amended, and officials embarked on a campaign to drum up full support from the federal government to guarantee that the Rangers would be issued the necessary personnel and weaponry to “undertake whatever was needed.”

By September 2014, Operation Karachi was locked, loaded and finally ignited. Karachi was divided up into “defense phases” to carry out the meticulously planned operation, of which eight phases have since been completed with a ninth phase to be announced soon.

“Our plan was not rocket science. We did what was needed. People were being killed day after day and the perpetrators were getting away with it,” Zubair said. “On 10 minutes notice, the whole city could be shut down, with people running to their homes amid the burning and looting. This was going on year after year, dozens of times a year. But for the first time in 2016, Karachi was not shut down a single time. That trend continued in 2017.”

Today in Karachi, students huddle in coffee shops by the seaside, and sneak prohibited beer and hookah into trendy clubs and restaurants. There is a renewed vigor for everything from mass-scale cricket matches to theater performances, film festivals, traditional dancing and cultural pursuits.

“In 2010, things were really at their worst. That was the year I started the Karachi Literature Festival. We had to have so many layers of security and only around five thousand people took the risk of attending,” recalled Ameena Saiyid, Chair of Oxford University Press Pakistan. “This year, we had 225 thousand people attend. Authors came from everywhere, and we are seeing families who left finally move back. There was no choice but for the law enforcement agencies to take this hardline approach.”

ELUSIVE ISIS LEADER AL-BAGHDADI BELIEVED HIDING OUT IN SYRIAN FRONTIER

Perhaps the most remarkable transformation is in the once deadly, absolute no-go area known as Lyari – a poverty-stricken slum rife with endless gangs, underground weapons-making caches and terrorist attack plot planners. These days, traffic clogs the narrow Lyari streets and vendors line the roadside as motorbikes maneuver in every direction. There is a marked resiliency that hangs in the cardamom-filled air.

“This was a very determined intervention. Violators were targeted regardless of political affiliation, and that was the key,” explained Sen. Javed Jabbar, a political analyst and former information minister. “Previous attempts to clean it up were always partisan. But this time, people saw it as a credible operation across the board. Nobody was exempt.”

According to Zubair, the first three years of the Karachi clean-up was focused on security stability. Next up, he said they intend to promote the return of foreign businesses to the city.

DISCOVERY OF MASS GRAVES IN IRAQ A GRIM REMINDER OF ISIS SAVAGERY

But critics contend the fragile bubble of Karachi calm could burst at any moment.

Last year, the chief of the militant group Ansarul Sharia – the Pakistan offshoot of the Libyan terror group responsible for the 2012 Benghazi attack on the U.S. compound – was among eight militiamen strategically targeted and killed by law enforcement. Taliban sympathizers are still known to use Karachi as fertile ground for recruitment, and rumors have run rampant within the western intelligence community over the past year that Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri uses Pakistan’s most populated city as a hideout.

“Pakistani police and military operations in Karachi may have on the surface reduced crime in Karachi. However, the city remains a breeding ground and hub of activity for a host of jihadist groups,” noted Bill Roggio, Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) and editor of Long War Journal. “The Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan, al Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, and Sipah-e-Sahaba maintain a significant presence in Karachi.”

The U.S. Department of State has assessed Karachi as a continued CRITICAL-threat location for terrorist activity, directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests and a HIGH-threat location for crime directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests.

“I don't think Karachi was ever cleaned up properly. Some just went into hiding and can be back anytime. Life in Karachi is fast, unsafe and unpredictable,” Asad, a 34-year-old in sales manager in the seaside Karachi enclave of Clifton quipped. “Everyone roams around as if they own the place. It is still a hopeless lawless jungle.”

Others argue that progress has stalled. The Citizens Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) statistics for 2017 showed that number of violent crimes such as kidnapping for ransom remained about the same as it did for 2016, although figures were far lower than that of 2015.

The cutthroat Karachi crackdown has also generated something of a political backlash among opposition figures, angered over citizens unjustly swept up in the mayhem.

“We know people have been wrongly implicated as criminals,” Zubair acknowledged. “But these cases will go to the court system.”",world
"Republican Sen. John Cornyn suggested his Democratic colleagues' behavior at the start of Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing would render them held “in contempt of court” in a regular court proceeding.

Fireworks erupted at the hearing as soon as Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley began his opening statements. Democrats continuously interrupted and spoke over the 84-year-old Republican to ask for more time to review some 42,000 documents the committee received last minute.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., specifically moved to adjourn the hearing. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., accused the committee of “rushing through this process in a way that is unnecessary.”

But Sen. Cornyn admonished his Democratic colleagues, saying if the hearing was “handled like a court of law” – as one Democrat had suggested – then “virtually every member” of the Democratic side “would be held in contempt of court.”

KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HEARING LIKELY TO FOCUS ON ABORTION, GUN RIGHTS AND MORE

“Because this whole process is supposed to be a civil one where people get to ask questions and we get to get answers, and that’s the basis we’re to exercise our constitutional responsibilities of advice and consent so I would just suggest we got on with the hearing,” Cornyn said.

He later said Democrats were trying to run the hearing according to “mob rule” and said they were being unfair as they had “already made up their minds” prior to the hearing.

Kavanaugh has left one of the longest paper trails of any recent Supreme Court nominee, having served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office during the George W. Bush administration.

Democrats have seen thousands of those documents but have want time to review more. They have also said they’ve been denied access to certain documents they say is needed to properly vet Kavanaugh.

BRETT KAVANAUGH HEARING INTERRUPTED BY DEMOCRATIC SENATORS, PROTESTS

Aside from Senate Democrats’ interruptions, at least 22 protesters who interrupted the hearing were arrested at its opening, according to the United States Capitol Police.

"Hillary Clinton didn't win the presidency in 2016, so is there another job she would like to have? The former Democratic Party nominee considered the question Friday at Harvard University and said she would like to run Facebook.

During an event at which she received the prestigious Radcliffe Medal for “transformative impact on society,” Clinton was asked which company she would like to lead as CEO.

Without any hesitation, Clinton named Facebook, noting that the social media giant has vast power and controls the flow of information.

“It’s the biggest news platform in the world … but most people in our country get their news, true or not, from Facebook,” she said.

The response drew mixed reactions on social media, though the attempt to put her name on the table may not be so out of the ordinary. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg openly endorsed Clinton’s candidacy while a co-founder of the social media giant, Dustin Moskovitz, led a nearly $30 million effort to defeat now-President Donald Trump.

Other Facebook employees contributed more money to Clinton's campaign -- some $114,000 -- than to those of any other candidate, according to Federal Election Commission data that takes into account only donations over $200, the Hill reported.

But the former U.S. secretary of state’s openness to run Facebook came at the time when the tech company is coping with a number of scandals, including alleged misuse of user data that allowed political campaigns, including possibly Clinton’s, to target potential voters after acquiring the data of millions of people.

Just this week, Facebook was accused of deceptive tactics to pressure people to accept its privacy policy. According to a complaint filed by the European Center for Digital Rights on behalf of an anonymous individual, the platform blocked users who didn’t consent to the new privacy policies and used “tricks” – including fake message notifications – to pressure them into agreeing with the policies.

“[Facebook] used additional ‘tricks’ to pressure the users: For example, the consent page included two fake red dots … that indicated that the user has new messages and notifications, which he/she cannot access without consenting — even if the user did not have such notifications or messages in reality,” the complaint reads, according to Australia's News.co.au.

CLINTON CAMPAIGN APP MAY HAVE HARVESTED FACEBOOK DATA OF MILLIONS

But similar to Cambridge Analytica, the company that was forced to shut down amid the data misuse scandal, the Clinton campaign itself may have harvested the data of potentially millions of users to get an edge over Trump.

In the midst of the election, Clinton's campaign launched a mobile application called “Hillary 2016” that allowed every user to pair their friends list on Facebook with their phone contacts – and give the campaign permission to access that info.

People who didn’t download the application - or weren’t even Clinton supporters – weren’t given an option to prohibit their Facebook friends from pairing their phone numbers with Facebook accounts and indicate their likelihood of voting for the Democratic candidate.",politics
"For those conservatives who voted for Donald Trump because of the Supreme Court, congratulations: You've been vindicated.

Had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, she would have replaced the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia with a liberal jurist -- giving the Supreme Court a left-wing activist majority for a generation. Because Trump won, Neil M. Gorsuch was confirmed to replace Scalia, securing the court's 5-to-4 conservative majority.

This week, the dividends of that appointment for conservatives were apparent in two landmark conservative rulings. In National Institute of Family Life Advocates v. Becerra, the high court ruled that the state of California cannot force crisis pregnancy centers to advertise access to abortion to their clients, in violation of the owners' conscience. And in Janus v. AFSCME, the court ruled that public workers cannot be forced pay union dues to support public policies with which they fundamentally disagree. These were critical 5-to-4 rulings that buttressed the First Amendment freedoms of all Americans.

Trump was able to preserve the status quo before Scalia's passing. But now, with the news that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is retiring, Trump has a chance to do something much bigger: He can not only preserve but also expand the court's conservative majority.

If he replaces Kennedy -- a swing vote who often joined the court's liberal bloc on important matters -- with a reliable conservative in the mold of Scalia and Gorsuch, the president may have transformed the court for a generation.

To do this, Trump will have to break the mold of his Republican predecessors. Over the past three decades, presidents from his party have picked seven justices, and several have turned out to be disappointments to conservatives.

If Trump picks not one, but two reliable conservative justices, he will secure the best record of Supreme Court appointments by any modern Republican president.

President Ronald Reagan picked three justices (Sandra Day O'Connor, Scalia and Kennedy), but only one, Scalia, was a consistent conservative. President George H.W. Bush picked one solid conservative (Clarence Thomas) and one (David Souter) who was not.

George W. Bush did better, appointing two conservatives, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and John G. Roberts Jr. But even Roberts disappointed conservatives when he cast the deciding vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act in a stroke of judicial activism.

If Trump picks not one, but two reliable conservative justices, he will secure the best record of Supreme Court appointments by any modern Republican president.

Liberals understand exactly what is at stake. That means whomever Trump picks will face a barrage of attacks unprecedented even by the standards of past confirmation brawls. But thanks to the Democrats' imprudent decisions to break precedent and change Senate rules to confirm lifetime appointments to the federal circuit court under President Barack Obama, and then to filibuster Gorsuch, Senate Republicans need only a simple majority to confirm Trump's choice. So long as Republican senators stick together, Trump's nominee will be confirmed.

Already some Democrats are protesting that the Senate should not confirm a Supreme Court justice during a midterm election year. Sorry, the Senate confirmed Obama appointee Elena Kagan in August 2010, just before the midterm elections -- and did so with a bipartisan 63-to-37 vote.

Democrats are grasping at straws because the timing couldn't be worse for them as they seek to gain control of the Senate in November. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has announced that the confirmation vote will take place in the fall, which would put Kennedy's replacement on the bench when the court's new term begins on the first Monday in October.

Pity the Democratic senators such as Joe Manchin III, W.Va., Heidi Heitkamp, N.D., Jon Tester, Mont., Claire McCaskill, Mo., and Joe Donnelly ,Ind., who are running for reelection in states Trump won by double digits. Their political survival depends on being perceived as centrists, and they will now have to spend months campaigning while caught in the crossfire of a liberal-conservative battle royal over a Trump-nominated Supreme Court justice. Vote yes, and their liberal base will be apoplectic; vote no, and their pro-Trump constituents could revolt.

For all these reasons, Trump's appointee is likely to be confirmed. If that happens, Trump will have led one of the most consequential conservative presidencies in modern American history. Not only is Trump expanding the conservative Supreme Court majority, he is also moving at record pace to fill the federal appeals courts with young conservative judges who will preside for decades. Imagine if it were Clinton making all these appointments. The consequences for human life, religious liberty, the Second Amendment and limited government would have been disastrous.

Instead, the choice of the next Supreme Court justice is in President Trump's hands. So, to all the conservatives who cast their ballots in 2016 for just this moment -- you did the right thing.",politics

On the roster: What happened to coal - Cohen to strike plea deal with federal prosecutors - Manafort jury note signals problems reaching consensus - Will cold hard cash be enough for Friess? - Pretty authentic

WHAT HAPPENED TO COAL

The story of coal in America over the past century could be neatly summed up as: More mining, fewer miners.

Consider that U.S. coal production hit its all-time high in 2001 when American mines produced 1.1 million tons of coal.

But U.S. coal employment, at least for the era of reliable statistics, peaked in 1985 with more than 178,000 miners.

There are lots of good arguments to be made for and against coal as a fuel choice, but in the end, none of them really have much to do with employment. New mining techniques and technology have already wiped out the majority of coal jobs over the past 30 years.

That’s how in 2016, when coal employment hit its lowest level so far, 48,800 miners were able to produce more coal than in earlier years when almost four times as many miners were at work.

The industry trend toward higher production and profits with lower employment started to run into serious trouble in the 1990s with the imposition of new environmental regulations against smokestack pollution that made coal more expensive to burn.

But given America’s fundamental aversion to ultra-cheap nuclear power and the historical instability of oil and natural gas prices, there wasn’t much for electric companies to do but pay more to use coal.

What changed that more than anything else was another technological revolution: Radical advancements in finding and extracting natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing, or as we mostly know it, “fracking” has been a new industrial revolution in America. There are huge deposits of clean-burning natural gas under much of the United States, but for most of history they were not extractable. Now, there is drilling and tapping of subterranean petroleum lakes in ways they never could have dreamed before.

The discovery of these massive new proven reserves has permanently changed the national economy and the way we get our electricity. Gas was always cleaner than coal, it was just too unpredictably priced to be a mainstay for electric utilities. No longer.

A decade ago, coal made up 49 percent of the nation’s electricity supply and natural gas was just 20 percent. This year, coal and natural gas each account for a third of our electricity. As that trend continues, coal will go on to join the ranks of nuclear, wind and hydroelectric power as minor contributors.

The Obama administration sought to accelerate a demise it could otherwise claim little credit for bringing about. Once it failed to pass legislation restricting greenhouse gasses, the administration turned to regulatory means.

The Environmental Protection Agency used existing rules aimed at smog and other air quality concerns and tightened them down to the point that coal would be essentially an impossibility. The law would not allow them to regulate global warming emissions, but they found a way to bury coal anyway.

Once a driver of employment nationally and a leading indicator of national economic trends, coal is a shadow of a shadow or a sliver of itself. We live in a country where there are 30 times fewer coal miners than there are, say, mechanical engineers.

But yet, no one ever holds a political rally to exult the hard, honest work of more than a million American mechanical engineers. And politicians don’t cut ads where they put on the face masks worn by more than a half million dental assistants and dental hygienists like they would a miner’s helmet.

That’s because the dangerous, important and macho work of digging coal out of the earth holds a special place in our national imagination. Like steelmaking and auto manufacturing, coal mining is a symbol of America’s rise to dominance and of Americans’ character.

President Trump heads to West Virginia today to celebrate the next big step in his administration’s effort to roll back the Obama-era environmental rules. He will no doubt be given a hero’s welcome in a state where he may be loved better than any other.

But don’t forget that it was mechanization and technology that ended coal’s reign as a king of American industry far more than anything Barack Obama ever did. And those market forces will likely remain in place long after Trump is gone.



THE RULEBOOK: AHHH, WE GET IT

“By multiplying the means of gratification, by promoting the introduction and circulation of the precious metals, those darling objects of human avarice and enterprise, it serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of industry, and to make them flow with greater activity and copiousness.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 12



TIME OUT: SASQUATCH SHOUT OUT

Smithsonian: “Sixty years ago this fall, Bigfoot first stepped into the public consciousness. ‘Giant footprints puzzle residents,’ a headline in the Humboldt Times announced. The small Northern California newspaper reported that a road construction crew had discovered humanlike footprints that were a massive 16 inches long. The paper was the first to give the mysterious animal that made the prints its memorable moniker—‘Bigfoot’—and the creature has been stomping through the American imagination ever since. Today, the legendary beast seems to be everywhere… And the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization lists at least one report from every state, except Hawaii, over the past two decades. The most recent sighting, in June 2018, was by a woman in Florida who reported a creature that looked like ‘a large pile of soggy grass.’ Other evidence in the database includes supposed Bigfoot scat, nests and noises. If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, it may not make a sound—but it seems someone will report that a Bigfoot knocked it over. ‘Interest in the existence of the creature is at an all-time high,’ the paleontologist Darren Naish has observed, even though ‘there’s nothing even close to compelling as goes the evidence.’”

COHEN TO STRIKE PLEA DEAL WITH FEDERAL PROSECUTORS

Fox News: “Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen is striking a deal with federal prosecutors, Fox News has learned. Sources say the talks have moved swiftly. The terms of the deal are not yet clear, but Cohen is scheduled to appear at a New York federal court hearing at 4 p.m. ET. The confirmation comes after it emerged earlier Tuesday that Cohen's legal team was in talks for a possible plea deal in the financial fraud investigation against him. The Associated Press reported that Cohen could plead guilty as soon as Tuesday afternoon if a deal is struck requiring cooperation with the government.”

MANAFORT JURY NOTE SIGNALS PROBLEMS REACHING CONSENSUS

Fox News: “The jury weighing multiple fraud charges against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort passed a note to the judge on Tuesday signaling difficulty reaching consensus on at least one count, as deliberations stretched into their fourth day. The note passed to Judge T.S. Ellis III asked: ‘If we cannot come to consensus on a single count...what does that mean for the final verdict?’ Ellis responded that this would not be ‘exceptional’ and said the jury could reach a ‘partial verdict.’ The 12-member jury is considering 18 charges relating to tax and bank fraud against Manafort. Defense attorney Kevin Downing asked Ellis if he would tell the jury they have a third option – ‘hung jury’ -- on each of these counts. The prosecution objected to that plan and Ellis agreed. The jury also asked about how to fill out the sheet with their verdict. Defense attorneys generally see long deliberations as an indication that jurors disagree about their clients' guilt or have substantive concerns about complicated legal aspects of the case, which could lead to a hung jury, or that they have avoided rushing to judgment. But experts have cautioned that the case against Manafort is complex, and that jurors could simply be taking their time.”



WILL COLD HARD CASH BE ENOUGH FOR FRIESS?

Politico: “Millionaire megadonor Foster Friess has spent more money, racked up more national endorsements and blanketed the airwaves more aggressively than any other Republican in [today’s] Wyoming governor’s primary. It might not be enough to win. Friess may be a household name in conservative fundraising circles, but he started his surprise bid for governor largely unknown in Wyoming compared to the other leading candidates: state Treasurer Mark Gordon and businessman Sam Galeotos. Friess’ carpet-bomb ad campaign has helped, with the latest polling showing Friess deadlocked with Gordon and Galeotos lurking just behind. …Friess’ start-from-scratch career in state politics, after focusing on national issues as a donor, may be too big an obstacle to overcome. ‘He's got plenty of jack and he's using every cent of it. Every cent of it,’ said former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson, who is supporting Gordon. ‘We'll see whether you can really buy a governor's race.’”

Trump endorses Friess in Wyoming - Fox News: “President Trump endorsed Republican Foster Friess, a wealthy conservative businessman, in Wyoming’s gubernatorial primary on Tuesday. ‘He will be a fantastic Governor! Strong on Crime, Borders & 2nd Amendment. Loves our Military & our Vets. He has my complete and total Endorsement!’ Trump said in a tweet. Friess, 78, previously told Fox News Wyoming needs a political “outsider” – particularly a businessman – as its governor. … Friess has also been endorsed by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Donald Trump, Jr., the president’s oldest son.”

Barrassso looks to fend off deep-pocketed challenger - FiveThirtyEight: “Flying under the radar is the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, where U.S. Sen. John Barrasso is facing the first significant challenge of his career. Businessman Dave Dodson has invested $1 million of his own money in his campaign; Barrasso has reacted to the challenge by launching ads touting records that show Dodson is a former Democratic donor. Trump endorsed Barrasso in a July 31 tweet, which should give the incumbent a significant boost but could also be a sign that he’s facing a real race. No matter what, the GOP will be heavily favored to hold both seats in a state that’s 48 points more Republican-leaning than the country at large.”

Alaska GOP looks for path back to governor’s mansion - Anchorage Daily News: “Voters in Alaska [today] will select a Republican to move on to what's expected to be a closely watched governor's race this fall and choose the latest contender to try to unseat the longest-serving member of the U.S. House. … Former state Sen. Mike Dunleavy and former Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell are the highest-profile candidates seeking the Republican nomination for governor. The winner advances to the November general election. Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, is skipping Tuesday's primaries, while former U.S. Sen. Mark Begich is unopposed in the Democratic primary. Libertarian William ‘Billy’ Toien also is running. In Alaska's other big race, independent Alyse Galvin and Democrat Dimitri Shein are among the candidates vying for a shot to take on Republican U.S. Rep. Don Young. The 85-year-old Young has served in the House since 1973.”

SWING STATE GOP GOVS. DISTANT FROM PARTY’S NOMINEES

WaPo: “Four term-limited Republican governors in swing states have kept a surprising distance between themselves and the nominees picked by their party to replace them, an unusual dissonance that could have long-lasting effects on their states. In Nevada, Gov. Brian Sandoval, who broke with much of his party to oppose the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, has said he will stay neutral in the November election between Republican Adam Laxalt and Democrat Steve Sisolak. In Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder has declined to endorse Bill Schuette, who defeated Snyder’s lieutenant governor to win the GOP nomination. … Two other Republicans have hinted that their support for the party’s gubernatorial nominees will be limited. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, who, like Sandoval, opposed the repeal of the ACA, said that Republican nominee Stevan Pearce was ‘the best candidate’ in the race but demurred on whether she’d campaign for him. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has defended the state’s Medicaid expansion from some Republican criticism, has endorsed GOP nominee Mike DeWine, but did so only after DeWine clarified that he would not undo the policy.”

Kansas Dems to legally challenge independent gubernatorial candidate - AP: “Kansas Democrats launched a legal challenge Monday in hopes of removing Kansas City-area businessman Greg Orman from the November ballot as an independent candidate for Kansas governor after Orman stoked fears that his bid would imperil Democrats’ chances of winning. Attorney Will Lawrence filed a formal objection to Orman’s candidacy Monday with the Kansas secretary of state’s office. Lawrence is lawyer and chief of staff for Kansas Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, of Topeka, but has hired a prominent Topeka lawyer to pursue the challenge. Many Democrats fear that Orman could siphon votes from their nominee, state Sen. Laura Kelly, of Topeka, helping the Republican, conservative Secretary of State Kris Kobach. The objection will be considered by a state board made up of Kobach’s top deputy, Attorney General Derek Schmidt and Lt. Gov. Tracey Mann, all Republicans.”

De Leon challenges Feinstein to debate him at home in California - Politico: “Underfinanced and trailing in the polls, state Sen. Kevin de Leon ratcheted up the pressure Monday on Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, demanding that she ‘come home to California’ and participate in a debate for the first time in nearly two decades. ‘The voters of this great state may know Sen. Feinstein by name, but we don’t know where she stands on many issues,’ said de Leon, repeatedly casting California’s ‘senior senator’ as an elected official who has over the years lost touch with constituents — and with progressive and younger Democrats on issues of concern to them in her solidly blue state. The 51-year-old De Leon challenged Feinstein, 85, to three debates, saying: ‘The seat in the U.S. Senate is not entitled ... Here in California, we hold elections — not coronations.’”

Adelson gives millions to help Senate GOP - WaPo: “Billionaires Sheldon and Miriam Adelson shelled out $25 million in July to the main super PAC supporting Senate Republicans, bringing their support for holding the GOP majority in both chambers of Congress to at least $55 million and securing their status as the biggest donors to super PACs so far this cycle. The $25 million from the casino magnate and his wife, a physician, marked their first donations this cycle to the Senate Leadership Fund, the super PAC aligned with Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that is working to maintain the GOP majority in the Senate this fall, according to Federal Election Commission records filed Monday evening.”

Giffords endorses two NJ Republicans - NYT: “The political action committee co-founded by Gabrielle Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman from Arizona who was shot and seriously wounded in 2011, has made 144 state and federal endorsements in the 2018 election cycle, backing candidates it believes will push for more gun control. Three of those endorsements went to Republican candidates, two of whom are from New Jersey. On Friday, the group, Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence, endorsed Representatives Leonard Lance and Chris Smith, a move that surprised Democrats and gave a boost to Mr. Lance, who is locked in a tight battle for his seat despite being from a district that has not elected a Democrat since 1978. (The third Republican endorsed by the group is Representative Brian Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania.) The nonpartisan Cook Political Report has rated Mr. Lance’s seat as a tossup. Mr. Smith’s seat is the only Republican seat in New Jersey considered safe, according to the Cook Political Report.”

FBI begins investigation into Calif. House campaign computer hacks - AP: “The FBI launched investigations after two Southern California Democratic U.S. House candidates were targeted by computer hackers, though it’s unclear whether politics had anything to do with the attacks. A law enforcement official told The Associated Press the FBI looked into hacks involving David Min in the 45th Congressional District and Hans Keirstead in the adjacent 48th District. Both districts are in Orange County and are seen as potential pickups as the Democratic Party seeks to win control of the Congress in November. A person with knowledge of the Min investigation told the AP on Monday that two laptops used by senior staffers for the candidate were found infected with malware in March. It’s not clear what, if any, data was stolen, and there is no evidence the breach influenced the contest.”

“Chris, John McCain has not been in DC for almost 9 months… why hasn’t he resigned and allow a Republican governor to replace him? With the votes in the Senate so tight is this his way at getting back at Trump?” – Bob Hoffman, Montgomery, Ala.

[Ed. note: I can see why you might think that, Mr. Hoffman. But the way it works in the Senate is that you have to have a majority of the votes present, not the majority of the seats. With McCain out of commission, a majority in the Senate needs only 50 of 99 votes. The balance of power is essentially unchanged by his absence. Where McCain might make the difference, however, is on a measure where he would be likely to vote with GOP leadership while one or two other Republicans dissent. If McCain were a more reliable partisan this would be a more pressing concern for the GOP. But since he prides himself on being a maverick, he’s never been one that Republican leaders could count on having in the bag.]

PRETTY AUTHENTIC

WHNT: “A man visiting a Portuguese art museum was injured Monday after he fell down an installation consisting of a hole that has been made to look like a black circle painted on the ground. The museum visitor, in his 60s, was treated at the hospital and released, according to Portuguese newspaper Público. The accident happened at the Serralves Museum in Porto where ‘Descent Into Limbo’ by Anish Kapoor is on exhibit. The installation consists of a hole in the ground that descends roughly eight feet. Almost reminiscent of the portable hole gag in Wile E. Coyote cartoons, Kapoor painted the sides black, making the pit appear two-dimensional. The exhibit reportedly had multiple warning signs and at least one employee tasked with keeping visitors safe inside the room. ‘An accident happened,’ Fernando Rodrigues Pereira, Serralves’ press officer, told Artnet News in an email. ‘Now this installation is temporarily closed.’ Pereira told Artnet News that the man is out of the hospital and ‘recovering well.’”

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“Ronald Reagan, I was once told, said he liked The Natural except that he didn’t understand why the Dark Lady shoots Roy Hobbs. Reagan, the preternatural optimist, may have had difficulty fathoming tragedy, but no one knows why Hobbs is shot. It is fate, destiny, nemesis. Perhaps the dawning of knowledge, the coming of sin. Or more prosaically, the catastrophe that awaits everyone from a single false move, wrong turn, fatal encounter. Every life has such a moment. What distinguishes us is whether — and how — we ever come back.” – Charles Krauthammer writing in the National Review, August 17, 2007.

On the roster: Trump folds on flag - Trump makes big push for DeSantis on primary eve - Key defection rattles Kansas governor race - 525 days and counting: Iowa Democrats set caucus date - Sir, the expression is ‘when life gives you lemons…’

TRUMP FOLDS ON FLAG

USA Today: ‘The U.S. flag flying over the White House was brought back down to half-staff Monday afternoon after an outcry over the decision to raise it just two days after the death of Arizona Sen. John McCain In his first formal statement on McCain’s death, President Donald Trump said he respected McCain's service and ordered the flags back down. … Amid an outpouring of praise for McCain – a former prisoner of war, a longtime lawmaker and two-time GOP presidential candidate – Trump made only a brief statement about the senator's death, offering condolences to his family on Twitter but no words of praise for McCain himself. The two had a long history of mutual disdain. Monday, veterans groups criticized the decision to lower the flag for only two days.”

Trump refused to praise McCain - WaPo: “President Trump nixed issuing a statement that praised the heroism and life of Sen. John McCain, telling senior aides he preferred to issue a tweet before posting one Saturday night that did not include any kind words for the late Arizona Republican. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and other White House aides advocated for an official statement that gave the decorated Vietnam War POW plaudits for his military and Senate service and called him a ‘hero,’ according to current and former White House aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations. The original statement was drafted before McCain died Saturday, and Sanders and others edited a final version this weekend that was ready for the president, the aides said. But Trump told aides he wanted to post a brief tweet instead, and the statement praising McCain’s life was not released.”



Memorial arrangements set - AP: “Sen. John McCain’s service to his country began more than six decades ago at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis and will end there in a cemetery overlooking Maryland’s Severn River. ... Plans taking shape called for McCain to lie in state Wednesday in the Arizona State Capitol on what would have been his 82nd birthday. A funeral will be conducted Thursday at North Phoenix Baptist Church with former Vice President Joe Biden speaking. In Washington, McCain will lie in state Friday in the Capitol Rotunda with a formal ceremony and time for the public to pay respects. On Saturday, a procession will pass the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and arrive for a funeral at Washington National Cathedral. Former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama are expected to speak at the service. A private funeral is planned for Sunday afternoon at the Naval Academy Chapel followed by a private burial at the academy cemetery.”

Ariz. governor will announce McCain’s successor after burial - WaPo: “Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey will not announce a replacement for the late senator John McCain until he is laid to rest, a spokesman for the governor said Sunday. … ‘Out of respect for the life and legacy of Senator John McCain and his family, Governor Ducey will not be making any announcements about an appointment until after the senator is laid to rest,’ said Daniel Ruiz, a spokesman for Ducey. ‘Now is a time for remembering and honoring a consequential life well lived.’ … State law requires Ducey to appoint someone from McCain’s party to fill the seat. The governor, a Republican who is running for reelection this year, has ruled out naming himself. But he has otherwise remained silent on the decision. Arizona Republicans have mentioned a lengthy roster of potential successors — a list that includes McCain’s widow, Cindy; Ducey’s chief of staff, Kirk Adams; State Treasurer Eileen Klein; former congressman John Shadegg; and former U.S. senator Jon Kyl, who has been helping Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh navigate the Senate confirmation process.”

Dems remember McCain - Fox News: “In his more than three decades of service on Capitol Hill, Sen. John McCain was known for many things: his dedication to the United States, his passion and his temper, his strong convictions, and, maybe most notably, his ability to work across the aisle to get results. That dedication to bipartisanship was on full display in the hours following McCain’s death… ‘Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did,’ Former President Barack Obama said in a statement.”

TIME OUT: AN UPGRADE FOR TEACHERS’ DESKS

USA Today: “At their core, Americans have changed – at least when it comes to their apple preferences. The Red Delicious apple is likely to lose its title as the most popular apple this year, a perch it held for more than half a century. The U.S. Apple Association is projecting that the Gala apple will usurp the Red Delicious for the top spot. The group, which advocates on behalf of 7,500 apple growers and 400 companies in the apple business, predicted that the U.S. would grow 52.4 million Gala apples in 2018, up 5.9 percent from a year earlier. Red Delicious apple production is expected to tumble 10.7 percent to 51.7 million. Consumers apparently like the Gala's ‘taste, texture and sweetness,’ the U.S. Apple Association said in a statement. ‘The rise in production of newer varieties of apples aimed at the fresh consumption domestic market has caused demand for Red Delicious to decline,’ said Mark Seetin, the association's director of regulatory and industry affairs.”

TRUMP MAKES BIG PUSH FOR DESANTIS ON PRIMARY EVE

Orlando Sentinel: “President Donald Trump is hoping to deliver victory to U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis in Tuesday’s Republican gubernatorial primary. He recorded a phone message sent to GOP voters Monday, a day before they head to the polls. ‘I love Florida,’ Trump says in the message paid for by Ron DeSantis for Governor. ‘I fully endorse Ron in tomorrow’s election. Ron is a strong, solid conservative. He stood with me to build the wall, which is under construction right now, fight crime and cut taxes.’ … ‘Congressman Ron DeSantis is a special person who has done an incredible job,’ the president wrote. … DeSantis’ opponent, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, has said he supports Trump’s agenda, while trying to portray DeSantis as being out of touch with Florida-specific issues.”

Race looks tight - LAT: “With only days to go to the Tuesday primary, a Florida Atlantic University poll of likely Republican voters released last week has the race’s two leading candidates almost neck and neck, with DeSantis at 32% and Putnam at 31%. About 22% were undecided. Putnam is just the latest well-connected establishment Republican to struggle after Trump backed a rival in a state primary race. Already, Trump’s Twitter posts have helped push longshot GOP candidates to victory in a string of Southern and Midwestern states.”

Dems duke it out for governor nod - Fox News: “As the campaign speeches and bus tours draw to an end, all five of the Democratic candidates vying for Florida GOP Gov. Rick Scott’s seat are scrambling for every last vote ahead of Tuesday's primary. …. But Fox News rates the race for the open seat a ‘toss up’ in November, as Democrats eye a potential pickup. … On the Democratic side, former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham has held a steady lead over former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, Palm Beach billionaire Jeff Greene, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum and Orlando businessman Chris King.”

Ahead in the polls, McSally looks past Tuesday - Politico: “Republicans hope to put a year of intra-party warfare behind them in Tuesday’s Arizona’s Senate primary, as they defend a vital battleground state that has fueled Democratic hopes of winning the Senate majority. Rep. Martha McSally is expected to capture the GOP nomination after leading every public poll of a long and unpredictable primary. … McSally became the preferred candidate of most Republicans in Washington, but she has been dogged all year by two hardline challengers: former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. [In] a show of confidence last week, McSally turned her attention to Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who faced only nominal primary opposition and spent the year positioning herself as a bipartisan dealmaker in preparation for the general election.”

KEY DEFECTION RATTLES KANSAS GOVERNOR RACE

Topeka Capital Journal: “Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer's former campaign chairman and one of the state's prominent agriculture leaders Monday agreed to serve as co-chair of candidate Greg Orman's independent bid for governor in Kansas. Steve Baccus, longtime president of the Kansas Farm Bureau, passed over Republican gubernatorial nominee Kris Kobach to endorse and agree to work for election of Orman, a Johnson County businessman. Baccus' opportunity to affiliate with Kobach, Orman or three others campaigning for governor followed Colyer's razor-thin loss in the Aug. 7 primary. ‘I made it clear when I joined Governor Colyer's campaign that I believed Kansas needed a leader who was committed to the state,’ Baccus said. ‘While my candidate in the primary election did not succeed, I remain committed to ensuring that Kansas has the best leaders possible.’”

Will Nelson choke? - Politico: “[Sen. Bill Nelson] slightly trails Gov. Rick Scott, even though President Donald Trump barely carried Florida, while Manchin is leading in a state Trump won by 42 points. Privately, a number of Democratic senators have offered their unsolicited view that Nelson is in for a reckoning on Election Day, which would cost Democrats any hope of winning back the Senate. Nelson is a classic old-school senator who keeps his head down and does his work, which is effective in the Capitol but less so in a Trump-era campaign in the most expensive battleground state. He’s being vastly outspent, and there’s concern in Florida the national party might cut him loose if a loss looks certain in the expensive Sunshine State. And Florida Democrats fret that the low-key third-term senator has not been visible enough while Scott is seemingly everywhere.”

525 DAYS AND COUNTING: IOWA DEMOCRATS SET CAUCUS DATE

Des Moines Register: “Iowa is set once again to lead off the Democratic Party's presidential nominating process with its first-in-the-nation caucuses: The Democratic National Committee on Saturday scheduled that party's caucuses for Feb. 3, 2020. The DNC also approved new recommendations from a panel known as the Unity Reform Commission that are designed to increase voter participation and bring transparency to the caucus process. ‘We feel very good about the rules that were passed today and the goals that the DNC has laid out to implement some changes to the caucuses,’ said Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price. Price said the goal is for the Democrats and Republicans each to hold their caucuses on the same night in 2020, as they have done for decades. He said he hopes to have more conversations with his Republican counterparts in the coming weeks.”

"The Latest on the Syria conflict (all times local):

7:30 p.m.

Syrian state media and an independent monitoring group are reporting an Israeli air raid targeting government-held areas in the center and west of the country.

Syria's SANA news agency says Israeli jets flying at high altitude above Lebanon fired several missiles on the area of Wadi Ayoun in Syria's Hama province, killing at least one person, and the town of Baniyas in the coastal Latakia province. The attack was launched on Tuesday around dusk.

It says the country's air defenses shot down five of the missiles.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported several explosions in the two areas. It says Israeli jets struck military installations belonging to Iran, a key ally of the Syrian government.

Israel is believed to be behind a string of strikes targeting government and allied military installations. The Syrian government accused Israel of striking a weapons research facility near Wadi Ayoun in July.

___

3:15 p.m.

The Kremlin has criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's warnings against a possible Syrian government attack on a rebel-held enclave.

Trump on Monday sent a tweet warning the Syrian government and its allies against a ""reckless attack"" on rebel-held Idlib province. Russia has been a key backer of President Bashar Assad and has complained about militants in Idlib targeting its own facilities and posing a terrorist threat on the whole.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday reiterated Russia's stance and called Idlib ""a hornets' nest of terrorists.""

Asked about Trump's tweet, Peskov said such warnings do not take into account ""the dangerous and negative potential"" of the rebel-held enclave and show that the White House does not have a ""comprehensive approach"" to solving the Syria crisis.",world
"President Trump ripped Joe Biden in newly aired interview comments, saying running against the ex-vice president in 2020 would be a “dream” and claiming former President Barack Obama “took him out of the garbage heap” in 2008.

“Well, I dream, I dream about Biden. That's a dream,” Trump said in an interview with CBS News, when asked about a Biden bid. “Look, Joe Biden ran three times. He never got more than one percent and President Obama took him out of the garbage heap, and everybody was shocked that he did. I'd love to have it be Biden.”

'President Obama took him out of the garbage heap, and everybody was shocked that he did. I'd love to have it be Biden.' - President Trump

Obama picked the veteran senator as his running mate in 2008. After serving two terms as VP, Biden was widely floated as a possible Democratic 2016 presidential candidate before he eventually ruled it out.

Biden, 75, has since said he is considering a possible run for the 2020 nomination. On Tuesday, he said at a forum in Bogota, Colombia that he had set himself a deadline of January to make a decision.



""I know I have to make up my mind and I have to do it by January,"" Biden said, according to USA Today.



Biden would likely face a packed field that could include candidates such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; Kamala Harris, D-Calif. and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.



Trump, 72, in the interview clip that aired Thursday, said he’d be happy to run against any of the rumored candidates, but he seemed to particularly relish running against Biden.



“I'd like to run against any one of them, but Biden ... by himself could never do anything,” he said. “President Obama took him, made him vice president and he was fine. But you go back and look at how he succeeded in running, when he ran two or three times, I don't think he ever broke one [percent].“

The remarks are part of a bigger war of words between the two. In March, Biden boasted how he would ""beat the hell"" out of Trump ""behind the gym,"" with Trump responding that if the two fought, Biden ""would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.""

LATEST EXCHANGE BETWEEN TRUMP, BIDEN PART OF A LONG PATTERN OF SCHOOLBOY-STYLE THREATS



In the interview with CBS this week, Trump also addressed the furor over his summit with Vladimir Putin. Trump said he holds the Russian president responsible for Kremlin efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. The remarks come after bipartisan outrage over comments Trump made in Helsinki on Monday in which he indicated he did not agree with the conclusion of intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in 2016.



Trump said he holds Putin responsible ""because he's in charge of the country, just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country.

""So, certainly as the leader of a country, you would have to hold him responsible, yes.""

"CNN’s April Ryan said Omarosa Manigault Newman stabbed her in the back and attempted to end her career when their once-friendly relationship soured.

“It was really ugly. It was so ugly,” Ryan said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Karen Hunter Show” on Tuesday.

Manigault Newman has been on a media blitz in support of her new book, “Unhinged,” and she has played various secret recordings of Trump and his staffers that she said were collected during her time working in the White House.

Ryan was on “The Karen Hunter Show” to promote her own book when she was asked if there was a section on Manigault Newman -- whom she considered a friend before the former Trump aide turned on her.

""I talk about her taping me. I warned everybody. I talk about her taping me. We had that fight between the Oval Office and the press office,” Ryan said. “It probably stemmed from the fact that she was very upset with me because I ...wouldn't be in her wedding and people were telling me she was very upset that I chose not to be in her wedding.”

The CNN contributor said that in addition to the wedding party beef, Manigault Newman turned on her in order to help Trump go after the media.

“She stabbed in the back, the neck, the eyeballs and in the front. She tried to cut my head off and put it on a platter and serve it up to Donald Trump,” Ryan told Hunter.

The feud between Ryan and Manigault Newman goes back to at least February of last year, when The Washington Post published a story headlined, “‘This is . . . Nixonian’: Reporter was taped by White House in heated exchange”. The Post’s Paul Farhi wrote that Ryan then claimed Manigault Newman said the CNN political analyst “was among a handful of journalists on whom the White House was keeping ‘dossiers’ of negative information.”

At the time, Manigault Newman called Ryan a “liar” and admitted to having a tape, while Ryan said she was considering legal action regarding the recording.

Ryan -- she's White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, in addition to her gig at CNN -- then told the SiriusXM host that Manigault Newman attempted to spread lies about her relationship to Hillary Clinton.

“I was very upset about that and we'll take care of what she said and the lies that she was spreading that is career-ending and I was doing this for about 20 years, when she did this,” Ryan said. “She said I was taking money from Hillary Clinton. I said, ‘Are you kidding me?’”

The Post also reported that Manigault Newman sent Ryan a note citing an unnamed story that tied her to Clinton.

“This story suggests that as a reporter, you are (or were) a paid Clinton surrogate. I pray this is not true! This could be hurtful to your legacy and the integrity of your work,” Manigault Newman reportedly wrote to Ryan at the time.

Ryan told the radio host that Manigault Newman wanted to “kill” her career, and that the truth could be easily proven.

“Now, here I am, a divorced single mother of two girls who works hard, and it's not just about taking food off my table. You are hurting my children. I'm a fierce mama bear. She lied on me,” Ryan said.

Ryan also claimed that Manigault Newman urged Trump's former press secretary, Sean Spicer, not to call on her during White House briefings.

Manigault Newman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",politics
"It's a match made in Hell.

Usama bin Laden’s son, Hamza bin Laden, reportedly married the daughter of the lead hijacker of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.

The late Al Qaeda leader’s half-brothers told The Guardian that Hamza, who has said he wants to avenge his dead terrorist dad, married the daughter of Mohammed Atta, an Egyptian national who hijacked and flew the first plane that crashed into the World Trade Center in 2001, the first blow in the 9/11 assault.

“We have heard he has married the daughter of Mohammed Atta,” Ahmad al-Attas, Hamza bin Laden’s half-brother, told the Guardian. “We’re not sure where he is, but it could be Afghanistan.”

The half-brother did not offer more details about the reported marriage or where he received the information about the nuptials. Atta’s personal life has remained mostly shrouded in mystery. The hijacker was reportedly never married and there were no past mentions of his children.

USAMA BIN LADEN'S BROTHER PLEADS WITH TERRORIST MASTERMIND'S SON NOT TO FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS

Hamza bin Laden, officially designated a terrorist by the U.S., surprised his family by going to Afghanistan where he has become an Al Qaeda leader under Usama’s former deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, The Guardian reported Friday.

Usama’s half-brothers, Ahmad and Hassan, reportedly shook their heads when asked about their nephew.

“We thought everyone was over this,” Hassan told the Guardian. “Then the next thing I knew, Hamza was saying, ‘I am going to avenge my father.’ I don’t want to go through that again.”

Hamza has previously made public statements urging followers to wage war on western cities including Washington and Paris.

"Robert Boyd Rhoades kidnapped eight-year-old Michael Lyons while he was walking home from school in 1996, stabbed him up to 80 times with a fishing knife and kept him alive for nearly 10 agonizing hours before dumping his body in the Feather River, just up the street from the child’s home.

The ‘Grim Sleeper’ killed nine women and a teenage girl over the course of 22 years, targeting drug addicts and hookers and tossing their naked bodies along roads or in the trash.

And the ‘Trailside Killer’ preyed on hikers along trails in state parks near San Francisco, telling cops that he reveled in making his victims beg in vain for their lives, before shooting them in the head, execution-style.

These are just some of the 744 inmates currently on California’s Death Row.

CALIFORNIA INMATE RELEASED AFTER 25 YEARS ON DEATH ROW

But as Jerry Brown’s tenure as governor of California draws to a close in January, capital punishment supporters have raised the specter that he could commute many, if not all, of the sentences.

On March 28, California’s Supreme Court issued an administrative order making it possible for Brown to commute the sentences or grant clemency.

Michele Hanisee, president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys in Los Angeles County, told the Orange County Register earlier this week that this removes any impediment Brown may have faced. Before that, a governor had to get the approval of the majority of the state Supreme Court in the case of an inmate with two or more felony convictions.

“They basically have green-lighted the governor to grant clemency to anyone…and said they won’t interfere,” she said.

California has the largest death row population in the country, but only 13 have been executed since capital punishment was reintroduced to the state in 1978, with the last one occurring in 2006. Appeals that drag out for many years are common. Last year, there were 400 death penalty appeals pending.

CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT BACKS PLAN TO SPEED DEATH PENALTY CASES

Despite its liberal reputation, more than half of California’s residents have expressed support for the death penalty, striking down referenda calling for it to end.

Brown, a former Jesuit seminarian who as a young man demonstrated against capital punishment, made his opposition to it clear during his political campaigns, but also said he’d respect the law regarding it while serving as attorney general and governor.

Asked if the governor was considering commuting death sentences, a spokesperson for Brown told Fox News: “A request for commutation is a serious matter, and every applicant is carefully and diligently vetted. The Governor issued commutations earlier this month… California inmates can petition to have their sentence reduced or eliminated by applying for a commutation of sentence.

“To be clear, no individuals on death row have received commutations.”

INSIDE SCOTT PETERSON'S LIFE ON CALIFORNIA'S DEATH ROW

Many families of victims of California’s death row inmates have been outspoken about capital punishment, with some supporting it and others opposing.

Beth Webb, whose sister and some friends died in a 2011 shooting at a hair salon, said at a 2016 press conference: “Neither me nor my mom will find closure in the death of another human being.”

Michael Lyons' mother, Sandra Friend, told the Los Angeles Times in 2016: “From the first inflicted wound to Michael, it was 10 hours to the last one.

“For a grown man to inflict that kind of painful torture on a child – he got the right sentence. He got the only sentence that would bring any justice.”

Kent Scheidegger, an attorney who argued for Proposition 66 – a measure to speed up executions – said that anything is possible as far as Brown and California politics, but he believed the governor would not commute death sentences.

“Despite his personal opinion, he said he’d enforce the death penalty,” said Scheidegger, who is legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in California.

Scheidegger expressed concern about the state high court’s order appearing to give Brown more sway over commuting death sentences, telling Fox News: “That’s worrisome.”

Since executions rarely have been carried out in California and elsewhere, some have called the death penalty symbolic, and pointless.

Scheidegger said he disagrees.

“It’s important because there are some crimes for which anything less is simply not justice.”

Some of California’s more notorious death row inmates are:

--Scott Peterson, who murdered his pregnant wife, Laci. Prosecutors said Peterson began plotting his wife's murder after he began an affair with a woman named Amber Frey, who testified against him.

--Robert Boyd Rhoades, who kidnapped eight-year-old Michael Lyons while he walked home from school. Lyons’ body was found the day after in a river near where he lived. Rhoades was on parole, and had been convicted on child molestation charges, when he kidnapped Lyons.

--Charles Ng, who along with an accomplice carried out a string of murders in 1984 and 1985, including torture and grisly killings of six men, three women and two babies. They killed the man for their cars and to steal from them. They turned the women into sex slaves and videotaped some of their crimes.

--Lonnie “Grim Sleeper” Franklin was convicted of killing nine women and a teenage girl from 1985 to 2007. Detectives believed he may have killed up to 25 people. He targeted women who were young and vulnerable. They were drug addicts or prostitutes. He dumped their naked bodies along roads or in the trash.

--David “Trailside Killer” Carpenter, who preyed on hikers. He killed seven people, raping some. Detectives said that he engaged in “putting the victims at some point in a position of pleading for their lives.”

--Run P. Chhoun, the suspected leader of the San Bernardino-based Tiny Rascals gang, was found guilty of murdering Nghiep Thich Le, 48, and his father, Hung Dieu Le, 73, during a home invasion robbery in Sacramento; and Miguel Vargas Avina, of Pomona. Authorities said Avina was killed because Chhoun and his accomplice Sam Pan mistakenly thought he was a rival gang member.

-- Richard Farley, a former employee of ESL Incorporated in Sunnyvale, stalked co-worker Laura Black for four years starting in 1984, sending her around 200 letters over the period. Black obtained a temporary restraining order against him on February 2, 1988, with a court date for February 17, 1988, to make it permanent. On February 16, he shot and killed seven people at ESL, and injured four more including Black.

--Randy Kraft, known as the ‘Scorecard Killer’, murdered at the very least 16 young men over a period of 11 years beginning in 1972. He is also believed to have committed the rape and murder of up to 51 other boys and young men. Many victims had been enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. He would typically ply them with alcohol and tranquilizers, before torturing, binding and sexually abusing them, before killing them usually by strangulation, asphyxiation or bludgeoning. He obtained his nickname after investigators discovered a coded list of 61 printed terms and phrases believed to refer to each of his victims.

--Ramon Salcido murdered seven people, including his wife and two of his daughters, aged four and 22-months in 1989 after a night of drinking and taking cocaine. His three-year-old daughter, Carmina, survived, even though she was slashed across the throat, and was left lying in a field beside the bodies of her sisters.

--Marcus Wesson, the patriarch of a cult-like clan, was sentenced to death 2005 for killing nine of his children, many of whom were born of incest and sexual abuse. He was also found guilty of sexually abusing the daughters and nieces who grew up in his house.

"Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson on Monday said anyone who disrespects the legacy of late Sen. John McCain “deserves a whippin’.”

“John was better than me and I know it” Isakson said on the U.S. Senate floor. “Anybody who in any way tarnishes the reputation of John McCain deserves a whipping, because most of the ones who would do the wrong thing about John McCain didn’t have the guts to do the right thing when it was their turn.”

""Anybody who in any way tarnishes the reputation of John McCain deserves a whipping, because most of the ones who would do the wrong thing about John McCain didn’t have the guts to do the right thing when it was their turn."" - Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson

Isakson’s comments were an apparent swipe at President Trump, who was criticized after the White House briefly broke the tradition and returned the flags to full height on Monday after flying them half-staff on Sunday, the day after the Arizona Republican succumbed to brain cancer at the age of 81.

“I would say to the president or to anybody in the world, it’s time to pause and say, ‘This was a great man who gave everything for us. We owe him nothing less than our respect that he earned.'”

Multiple veteran groups expressed dissatisfaction with the White House’s decision, issuing statements urging to reverse the action.

CHAD PERGRAM: AN EMPTY US CAPITOL AFTER McCAIN’S DEATH IS SOBERING REMINDER THAT THE CLOCK IS TICKING

In a statement directed to Trump, American Legion National Commander Denise Rohan wrote: ""On the behalf of The American Legion's two million wartime veterans, I strongly urge you to make an appropriate presidential proclamation noting Senator McCain's death and legacy of service to our nation, and that our nation's flag be half-staffed through his interment.""

VFW spokesman Joe Davis said in a statement the organization had ""asked the White House if the honor of lowering the flag to half-staff could be extended through Senator McCain's interment.""

Following the criticism from veteran groups, Trump ordered on Monday to fly the American flag at half-staff through this coming Sunday to honor McCain.

“Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain’s service to our country and, in his honor, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment,"" said Trump, who added that Vice President Mike Pence will make remarks at Friday's ceremony honoring McCain at the U.S. Capitol.

"Attorney General Jeff Sessions doubled down on his “zero-tolerance” policy on Tuesday when he told a crowd of law enforcement officers near the border that the Department of Justice would be stepping up its efforts to “achieve zero-tolerance, zero releases and 100 percent prosecution.”

Speaking at the Texas Border Sheriff’s Coalition Annual Spring Meeting with the Southwestern Border Sheriffs' Coalition, Sessions addressed 31 departments from Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, all of which are responsible for patrolling areas within 25 miles of the U.S.–Mexico border.

“Officers on the border are facing ... the most significant challenges still,"" he said. ""You have limited resources, you have manpower needs, bed space needs, equipment needs and you face a particularly violent threat every day. We have a crisis here. We know it, the president knows it and we’re determined to do something about it.”

Sessions' visit comes after the Justice Department announced it would be implementing a “zero-tolerance” policy on illegal border crossings.

Sessions slammed Congress on Friday for failing to pass “effective legislation that serves the national interest,” emphasizing such things as a lack of proper funding to build the wall along the southern border.

He said that ""the failure of Congress to move on the wall and other necessary steps is sending a message I am afraid that we are not resolute and it encourages more people to make the trip.""

Sessions added, “We’re going to step up our efforts to achieve zero-tolerance, zero releases and 100 percent prosecution.”

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCES ‘ZERO-TOLERANCE’ POLICY ON ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS

Illegal border crossing in March increased by 37 percent, resulting in more than 50,000 immigrants to the United States, which was triple the number of reported illegal border crossings in the same period last year.

Sessions spoke of a four-part plan to “take criminals off the street” by restoring the “rule of law” which he says will ultimately help to fix the immigration system.

The first measure includes the president’s order to send the National Guard to the border. President Donald Trump signed a proclamation last week asking the National Guard to send 2,000-4,000 troops to the border.

The second measure will include processing a backlog of cases in the immigration courts, a take Sessions calls “a challenge.”

“We are bringing in as much as 100 immigration judges to the border areas so that we can process these cases more effectively,” the attorney general said. This includes judges who can use video conferencing to hear more cases. He is asking that judges complete at least 700 cases a year.

TRUMP’S NATIONAL GUARD REQUEST FOR US-MEXICO BORDER DRAWS RESPONSE FROM SURROUNDING STATES

The third policy will involve a “border security coordinator in each U.S. attorney’s office,” whose job will be to restore law in the immigration system in every state.

The final measure looks to completely end the “catch and release” policy.

“We are strong, prosperous and an orderly nation, and such a nation must have a lawful system of immigration,” Sessions said.

Sessions also took a shot at so-called sanctuary cities, saying that their “extreme open borders policy” is “blocking us from the ability to identify” those who enter their communities with drugs or the intent to commit other crimes.

“City-states and counties that knowingly, willfully and purposefully release criminal aliens back into their communities are sacrificing the lives and safety of American citizens, law enforcement officers in pursuit of an extreme open borders policy,” he said.

"More Iranians are paying big money to buy passports in neighboring countries through bribery or fraudulent information, in a bid to evade U.S. sanctions and the Trump administration's travel ban on Iran and six other nations, multiple sources have told Fox News.

The Iranians are getting passports from a number of nations, sources said. But Iran's influence with some elements of the Iraqi goverment is now so prominent the issuing of passports through payoffs and corruption there has become a growing concern, Iraqi and other sources told Fox News.

“It means that Iranians aren’t then flagged as being from a country barred by the United States,” one Iraqi insider told Fox News. ""Mostly, it has been used by business people and merchants wanting to get around the economic sanctions and continue doing business with the West.”

One longtime Iraq-based, Western security expert stressed the Iranian influence inside Iraq has become “significantly heightened” since the ISIS onslaught, along with the establishment of a “Shia corridor” that enables unprecedented access – from Tehran through Baghdad, onto Damascus and then Beirut, posing a direct threat to Israel’s security.

Several counter-terrorism specialists in the U.S. also affirmed that security concerns over the passport issue have been heightened in recent months.

“It is going on, and it is not difficult to do – especially if you have a friendly government helping you out,” noted a former intelligence official currently working as a counter-terrorism consultant in the Middle East. “Iran has many allies in high-level positions in Baghdad.”

Sources also believe the passport issue may be a factor in the assassination of three Iraqi officials in just the last three months. The director of a provincial Iraqi Citizenship Department, Col. Amer Qasem Mohammed, and his aide, Lt. Col. Shaker Mahmoud were killed on Wednesday afternoon by gunmen on the road between Diyalah, near the Iranian border, and Baghdad.

And in late June, Col. Safa Hassan al-Dulaimi – the head of the directorate of passports in the southern Iraqi province of Babil – was assassinated in broad daylight on his way home. Several Iraq sources claimed the motive behind the assassination stemmed from his refusal to issue forged Iraqi passports to the powers behind the Iranian-backed militias.

Long-running international sanctions against Iran were lifted following the 2015 signing of the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). But President Trump in May pulled the United States out of the controversial agreement, prompting the U.S. Treasury to institute new sanctions against money transfer services, some state-operated airlines, as well as individuals aligned with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and missile program.

A full slate of U.S sanctions will be reimposed by November.

The Iranian government does not officially permit its country’s citizens to hold a second passport. But intelligence bureaucrats are known to allow select business figures to carry other passports for ease of travel, and doing business abroad.

Several Iraqi officials denied the notion of a fraudulent passport operation.

“Iraqi passports are issued with a high security standard and it is impossible to make forged passports through the institutes or through the officers who issue them. We get the eye cornea prints and fingerprints, we guarantee high security,” General Saad Maan Al Mousawi, a spokesperson for Iraq’s Ministry of the Interior, told Fox News. “But I say it is possible to fake the passports after they have been issued, if someone lost their passport or it was stolen, it could be forged. But not through legal ways.”

US WITHDRAWAL FROM IRAN DEAL HELPING WIND DOWN YEMEN WAR, OFFICIALS SAY

EXILED AFGHAN LEADER, AND ONE-TIME U.S. ALLY, WARNS AGAINST ""PEACE"" WITH TALIBAN FROM POSITION OF WEAKNESS

Another high-ranking ministry official, who requested not to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media, also insisted Iraq has not issued fraudulently passports for Iranian nationals. He said that if Iranians who could legitimately claim Iraqi citizenships want a passport, they must first obtain Iraqi national documents “which is not easy, is a long procedure, and requires the father to be Iraqi.”

But Iraq isn't the only neighboring country doling out passports to Iranians.

According to one Afghan government official, the problem is most evident in the border province of Herat, where national identification cards can be easily purchased on the black market, or through unscrupulous channels, thus making it significantly easier to obtain a passport under false pretenses.

One Kabul authority said Iranians have been known to pay between $5,000 and $10,000 to acquire all the needed documents – beginning with a national identification card – which then allows them to apply for a second passport.

While both the Iraqi and Afghanistan passports have little value on the internationally recognized Henley index of travel freedom, both ranking close to the bottom, their holders are not on the U.S. travel ban list. Moreover, in the latest available Corruptions Perceptions Index, unveiled in February, Iraq ranked as the 169th most corrupt country out of 180, while Afghanistan fell almost at the bottom, standing at 177.

Representatives for Iranian and Afghanistan governments did not respond to a request for comment.

“The proliferation of forged documents enables a host of illegal activities, like the travel of sanctioned or wanted individuals and other forms of illegal immigration. It is also a deliberate attack on the authority to secure its borders,” said David Ibsen, Executive Director of the not-for-profit, non-partisan policy organization Counter Extremism Project (CEP). “This is not surprising, as Iran will do what it can to circumvent sanctions.”

And the problem isn't contained in neighboring countries like Iraq and Afghanistan.

A Reuters investigation published in June revealed the Comoros Islands, a small nation off the east coast of Africa, suddenly had to cancel the passports “purchased” by more than 100 Iranians –including those of senior executives in industries all targeted by international sanctions.

The legitimate purchase of a passport in some countries is legal, and traditionally tied to individuals agreeing to invest a certain amount of money to boost small economies. This so-called “citizenship by investment” has been used by Iranians in a number of countries.

“Diplomats and security sources in the Comoros and the West are concerned that some Iranians acquired the passports to protect their interests as sanctions crimped Iran’s ability to conduct international business,” the Reuters report stated. “While none of the people or companies involved faced sanctions, the restrictions on Iran could still make a second passport helpful. Comoros passports offer visa-free travel in parts of the Middle and Far East and could be used by Iranians to open accounts in foreign banks and register companies abroad.”

Iranians are also among the largest national groups to be buying up passports as part of the Citizenship by Investment program for the Commonwealth of Dominica, as well as the island of Grenada. Passports from those countries allow visa-free travel to more than 100 countries.

This is not a new problem, some experts told Fox News.

A July 2013 congressional hearing on homeland security documented “the acquisition by hundreds and perhaps thousands of Iranian nationals of legitimate, original passports, codulas, and other national identity documents from Ecuador, Panama, Venezuela and Bolivia” had been granted largely to operatives in the Quds Force, Ministry of Intelligence and other intelligence services in Iran who can then “move across the region relatively undetected because they are no longer identifiable as Iranians.”

Recommendations at the time were made to “focus on the thousands of passports” that had been issued by these countries to Iranians, given the “vast bulk of people receiving these passports by complicit governments” were not tourists but agents “whose primary objective is to find vulnerabilities and points of entry into the United States, identify vulnerable targets in the region and prepare a military response if Iran’s nuclear program were to be attacked.”

The small Caribbean island of St. Kitts and Nevis drew the indignation of the U.S. Treasury Department in late 2014 after three suspected Iranian operatives were seized using St. Kitts passports to launder money at the behest of banks in Tehran, in violation of U.S. sanctions.

Furthermore, more than 5,000 passports then had to be annulled as they did not have listed a birthplace or were awarded to individuals who had changed their names.

The island did make a formal announcement in 2011 that going forward, Iranian investors would be suspended from participation in the citizenship by investment program, citing the “unfolding events coming from the international community” and re-asserting its own position as a “country friendly to all, and an enemy to none.”

But Iranians living abroad were, according to National Interest, were still applying for the citizenship in droves.

In August this year, Citizenship by Investment Unit (CIU) of Saint Lucia suddenly announced Iranians were no longer eligible for the program, saying they were “unable to undertake due diligence checks on site in Iran and validate documents issued from Iran.” No mention was made of second citizenships already issued.

“We know that much of the international Islamist terrorism is being directed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (ICRG). If entrants can acquire a passport from an ESTA eligible country, then they could more easily gain entry to the U.S,"" noted Tom Wilson, Research Fellow in the Center on Radicalization and Terrorism at the Henry Jackson Society, referring to the “Electronic System for Travel Authorization,” which facilitates visa waivers to the U.S.

“Iranians who hold second passports may well be able to buy property in the U.S, or do business with ordinary Americans,"" Wilson said. ""In particular is the concern that key Iranian figures will use these passports to try and avoid the full effects of sanctions.”

One British-based lawyer – a leader in facilitating legitimate pathways for people to procure second nationalities through investment – told Fox News that since Trump took office, and made clear the Iran nuke deal was in jeopardy, there has been a sharp pullback in taking on Iranian cases.

“It’s not worth the hassle,” the lawyer said.

A spokesperson for the U.S State Department insisted national security remains the top priority when adjudicating visa applications.

“Every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes extensive security screening. Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats,” the representative insisted.

“We are constantly working to find mechanisms to improve our screening process, allow travel and immigration to the United States while protecting U.S citizens and excluding individuals who might pose a threat.”

But security experts emphasized that while U.S technology and screening is top-notch, it is not unassailable.

“As long as the demand is there, criminals will find a way,” said Larry Johnson, former Secret Service agent and now CEO of CyberSponse. “In the meantime, the United States Government has to remain vigilant.”",world

Rescuers used helicopters and boats on Friday to evacuate thousands of people stranded on their rooftops following unprecedented flooding in the southern Indian state of Kerala that left more than 160 dead.

With heavy rains stopping after a week, rescuers moved quickly to shift those marooned by floods to 1,200 state-run camps where more than 150,000 people already have taken shelter.

Heavy rains over the past eight days triggered flooding, landslides and home and bridge collapses, severely disrupting air and train services in Kerala state, a popular tourist destination with scenic landscapes, waterfalls and beautiful beaches.

State officials have put the death toll at 164 since Aug. 8.

Monsoon rains kill hundreds of people every year in India. The season runs from June to September.

The monsoon flooding has severely hit 12 of Kerala's 14 districts, affecting the lives of more than 200,000 people with hundreds of homes damaged since June. Crops over 32,500 hectares (80,300 acres) of land have also been damaged, the Home Ministry said.

The international airport at Kochi, a major port city, has suspended flight operations until Saturday after the runway was flooded. Authorities also asked tourists to stay away from the popular hill station of Munnar in Idukki district because of flooding.

India's National Emergency Response Center said more than 800 people have lost their lives in seven states since the start of the monsoon season in June. A total of 247 people have died in Kerala, 190 in Uttar Pradesh, 183 people in West Bengal, 139 in Maharashtra, 52 in Gujarat, 45 in Assam and 11 in Nagaland state, the Press Trust of India reported.",world
"The co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the unverified Trump dossier, met with a Russian lawyer before and after a key meeting she had last year with Trump’s son, Fox News has learned. The contacts shed new light on how closely tied the firm was to Russian interests, at a time when it was financing research to discredit then-candidate Donald Trump.

Continue Reading Below

The opposition research firm has faced renewed scrutiny after litigation revealed that the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign paid for that research. Congressional Republicans have since questioned whether that politically financed research contributed to the FBI’s investigation of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign – making Fusion’s 2016 contacts with Russian interests all the more relevant.

The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred during a critical period. At that time, Fox News has learned that bank records show Fusion GPS was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a Kremlin-linked oligarch while paying former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump through his Russian contacts.

But hours before the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Fusion co-founder and ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson was with Veselnitskaya in a Manhattan federal courtroom, a confidential source told Fox News. Court records reviewed by Fox News, email correspondence and published reports corroborate the pair’s presence together. The source told Fox News they also were together after the Trump Tower meeting.

""What we are finding out is that there is a lot of Russian influence in Washington, and a lot of money flowing in to influence our political process in Washington."" - Marc Thiessen, former Bush Administration official

Simpson’s presence with Veselnitskaya during this critical week in June -- together with revelations about Fusion’s simultaneous financial ties to the DNC, Clinton campaign and Russian interests -- raise new questions about the company’s role in the 2016 election.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the Trump Tower meeting as part of his probe of Russian interference in last year’s election.

Continue Reading Below

Simpson and Fusion GPS were hired by BakerHostetler, which represented Russian firm Prevezon through Veselnitskaya.

Veselnitskaya has said she sought the Trump Tower meeting in order to lobby the candidate’s team against Russian sanctions, but the initial approach included an offer of compromising information on candidate Clinton.

Lawyers representing Fusion and Veselnitskaya did not respond to requests for comment lodged on Friday.

Senate Judiciary Committee investigators interviewed Simpson for more than 10 hours on Aug. 22. A spokesman for the committee had no comment on whether Simpson confirmed his contact with Veselnitskaya during the closed-door session.

The DNC and Clinton campaign hired Fusion in April 2016 through lawyer Marc Elias, who was general counsel for the Clinton campaign. Fusion, in turn, paid Steele $168,000 for the dossier, memos from which were shared with the FBI in the summer of 2016.

Fusion officials said last week Steele's money came from $1.02 million it received in fees and expenses from Elias' law firm Perkins Coie. Prior to contracting with the DNC, Fusion had been conducting research into Trump and other Republican candidates on behalf of the conservative website The Washington Free Beacon.

NBC News first reported that Veselnitskaya and Simpson were both at a hearing centered around another Fusion client, Russian oligarch Denis Katsyv. His company, Prevezon Holdings, was sanctioned against doing business in the U.S. for its alleged role in laundering more than $230 million. Fox News obtained audio records from that hearing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

The wrongdoing had been uncovered by Russian lawyer and whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, who was beaten to death in a Russian prison in 2009 after being arrested for probing Prevezon and other companies with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In December 2012, the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act was passed into U.S. law, freezing Russian assets and banning visas for sanctioned individuals. Fusion’s Simpson is believed to have been working with Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet counter-intelligence officer turned Russian-American lobbyist, to overturn the sanctions.

Akhmetshin also attended the June 9 Trump Tower meeting, along with about a half-dozen others including Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, publicist Rob Goldstone, Natalia's Russian translator Anatoli Samochornov and Ike Kaveladze from a Russian-American real estate agency.

Mueller’s interest in Fusion is unclear, but the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting one of several related congressional probes, recently struck a deal to gain access to Fusion’s bank records after initially issuing a subpoena. The records show that the DNC funded Fusion’s dossier effort.

Over the weekend, Fusion GPS sought a new restraining order after the House panel requested additional records that could reveal if Fusion was paying media companies or reporters for planting stories.

""What we are finding out is that there is a lot of Russian influence in Washington, and a lot of money flowing in to influence our political process in Washington,"" Marc Thiessen, a Washington Post columnist and former Bush administration official, said. ""It's going into Hillary Clinton. It's going to Fusion GPS. It's going into a lobbying campaign up on Capitol Hill against Magnitsky.""

Meanwhile, a request from Veselnitskaya and Katsyv for a new ""temporary immigration parole"" to return to the U.S. for a Nov. 9 Prevezon hearing in New York was denied, according to court documents reviewed by Fox News.

A Senate Judiciary Committee spokesman told Fox News they are ""encouraged"" that Veselnitskaya has ""signaled a willingness to cooperate"" with the committee.",politics
"President Trump’s favored candidate, GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis, defeated state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam in Florida’s Republican gubernatorial primary on Tuesday after riding the wave of the president's enthusiastic endorsement to victory.

Meanwhile, the Bernie Sanders-backed Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum pulled off a major upset in defeating a half a dozen rivals, including former Rep. Gwen Graham, in the Democratic primary.

DeSantis and Gillum will face each other in November's general election. If he triumphs, Gillum would be the state's first black governor.

During a celebration event in Orlando, DeSantis thanked the president for ""viewing me as somebody who could be a great leader for Florida.""

""Our victory is a good victory, anyways,"" DeSantis said, complimenting Putnam on a hard-fought race. ""But man, to beat someone of his caliber is a big, big deal.""

The president repeatedly had implored voters to support DeSantis over Putnam. Trump offered his congratulations on Twitter.

""Such a fantastic win for Ron DeSantis and the people of the Great State of Florida,"" Trump tweeted. ""Ron will be a fantastic Governor. On to November!""

Appearing on the ""Ingraham Angle"" later, DeSantis downplayed the notion that his win was due to the president's backing, and touted his record on combatting environmental problems, illegal immigration, and education reform.

""We've been talking about these key issues time and time again and we're going to continue to do that and spread the message far and wide,"" he said.

Gillum, Tallahassee’s progressive mayor backed by the Democratic-socialist Sanders, shocked observers with his win, as Graham, the daughter of former Florida Governor and Sen. Bob Graham, led in pre-election polls.

""I'm truly honored to represent people across the state as the Democratic nominee -- and I promise to stand up for everyday Floridians and the issues that matter most,"" Gillum tweeted after his win.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic socialist star running for New York's 14th district, praised Gillum for staking out liberal positions by supporting Medicare for all, legalizing marijuana and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“The progressive movement is transforming the country - and he proved that again tonight,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.

In the state's closely-watched Senate contest, Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott on Tuesday easily won the GOP nomination. He faced a challenge from perennial candidate Roque De La Fuente.

""Congratulations to Governor Rick Scott of Florida on his conclusive Republican Primary Win,"" Trump, who encouraged Scott to run, tweeted. ""He will be a great Senator!""

Scott, who is term-limited as governor, is set to face incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in what surely will be one of the most closely watched Senate races in November. Nelson ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.

But much of the attention in the run-up to Tuesday's vote had been on the contentious Republican gubernatorial primary between DeSantis and Putnam.

During a Fox News-sponsored debate in June, DeSantis played up Trump’s backing of his campaign, expressing doubt that Putnam adequately supported Trump. “I am proud to have the endorsement of President Trump in this race,” DeSantis said.

DeSantis, 39, is an Iraq War veteran and decorated military lawyer who has served in the U.S. House since 2013. He is a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School.

Putnam, 44, also played up his support for Trump, but emphasized, “I am focused on Florida.”

As for the Senate race, Republicans are hoping Scott could flip the seat in a battle with Nelson, one of the Democratic Party’s most vulnerable incumbents.

Trump narrowly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in Florida in the 2016 presidential race by less than 2 percentage points.

It was a good night for incumbents in House races in Florida, as Republican Carlos Curbelo and Democrat Stephanie Murphy were among those who beat back primary challengers.

National Democrats have eyed Curbelo's 26th congressional district as a potential pickup target, in large part because it voted heavily for Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. But with almost all precincts reporting, approximately 2,500 more people had turned out to vote in the GOP primary than in the Democratic primary.

Curbelo garnered 84 percent of the vote against primary opponent Souraya Faas, who described Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad as ""heroes"" and claimed chemical attacks in Syria's civil war were ""staged.""

In November, Curbelo will face Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a former associate dean at the Florida International University Medical School and Democratic candidate for state Senate.

Murphy, who unseated GOP incumbent John Mica in 2016, easily defeated a primary challenge in the 7th District from Chardo Richardson, who was backed by Ocasio-Cortez. She will face Florida state Rep. Mike Miller in November's general election.

"In an NBC “Today” interview this week, former President Bill Clinton had his arrogant and misogynistic behavior on full display when asked about the Monica Lewinsky scandal during his presidency. He demonstrated that nothing has changed since he left office.

Two decades later, we’re living in the era of #MeToo, and the man we almost sent back to the Oval Office – this time as a presidential spouse – thinks it’s about #HimToo.

In his interview with Craig Melvin, Clinton said: ""Nobody believes that I got out of that for free. I left the White House $16 million in debt.” #victimhood

Cue the violin.

Monica Lewinsky was a 24-year-old intern. Old enough to know better than to get involved in an obviously wrong relationship with the president of the United States, absolutely.

However, there is no comparison. Clinton was 51-year-old, a married man and a father of a young daughter, and he was the president. The burden of keeping it zipped fell on him.

If you’re tempted to feel bad about his $16 million debt – don’t. Clinton is in no danger of turning to a food bank or winding up in a homeless shelter for lack of funds.

Since leaving office in 2001, Bill and Hillary Clinton have managed to pull in more than $240 million. So $16 million in legal bills did not throw the Clintons into poverty.

If anyone didn’t get out of the scandalous relationship between the president and the White House intern without paying a price it was Monica Lewinsky. The shame and embarrassment of her bad choices have been life-altering and have followed her to this day.

Lewinsky has struggled to find work, even after earning a master’s degree, and at one point she even moved out of the country to gain some degree of anonymity. One organization even told her it would need a letter of indemnification from the Clintons before it could hire her.

During his NBC interview, President Clinton said he apologized to everybody and it was public, but when he was asked pointedly if he felt he owed a personal apology to Lewinsky he said, “No, I do not.”

Clinton attempted a mea culpa Monday night, likely to beat back the bad press he received from the NBC interview and put the focus on his new book that he’s promoting. However, he didn’t help his cause and just managed to come out sounding defensive again.

The Clintons are famous for placing blame anywhere but where it belongs – on themselves. While he admitted to getting “hot under the collar” during his NBC interview, Bill Clinton said it was because of the way the questions were asked. So now it’s NBC’s fault, apparently.

The former president went on to say: “The suggestion was that I never apologized for what caused all the trouble for me 20 years ago.” Did you catch that clever wording? “For what caused all the trouble for me.”

What caused all the trouble? It was you, Bill. Just look in the mirror and you’ll find the person responsible. You are what “caused all the trouble” for you.

More than 18 months after Donald Trump defeated her in the presidential election, Hillary Clinton still won’t admit she’s the reason she lost in 2016. Two decades later, Bill still won’t admit he is what has “caused all the trouble” for him.

He took another crack at a mea culpa Tuesday night when he went on the “The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert on CBS. Clinton admitted the NBC interview wasn’t his “finest hour,” when Colbert pressed him about being perceived as “tone deaf.”

Colbert said: ""Examples of men who were not held accountable for their behavior, especially men in power with younger women or people who worked for them, is worthy of being readjudicated or adjudicated for the first time, no matter how long ago it happened.”

Clinton said: “People need to know I apologized. I meant it then. I mean it now. ... And I still support Me Too. And I think we all need to keep trying to be doing better. And I would never dispute that.”

Then came the qualifier. The former president said it was very painful and he had to ""live with the consequences every day since.”

Again, go talk to Monica about consequences. Just last month Town & Country magazine disinvited her to the magazine’s Philanthropy Summit after Bill Clinton decided to attend. Bill Clinton has 240 million reasons not to worry about consequences.

In the era of #MeToo, even some Democrats have distanced themselves from President Clinton on the campaign trail, including Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, who was elected last year. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., also came out and said Clinton should have resigned from the presidency following the Lewinsky affair.

Bill Clinton reportedly is trying to rehab his image, with some in the media attempting to revive his old nickname, the “comeback kid.” As a likely part of his new image makeover, the Kennedys invited him to speak at the 50th anniversary commemoration of Robert F. Kennedy’s death at Arlington National Cemetery.

This attempt to raise the former president’s profile is not sitting well with women from his past who have accused him of sexual misconduct and feel he’s getting a pass.

Juanita Broaddrick, who has famously leveled accusations of rape at Clinton said: “I would like to know why? Why can you elevate Bill Clinton again to this level when he has done so many atrocious acts? …What on Earth could be the answer? Other than they believe Bill Clinton and they do not believe all the victims.”

Leslie Millwee, who accused Clinton of assault while she was an Arkansas TV reporter said: “People still laud him. When is that going to change? When is this man going to be held accountable for his behavior over the years?”

Broaddrick also took to Twitter to express her outrage at NBC and Craig Melvin for not bringing up her rape allegation against Clinton in the interview, tweeting: “This is so disgusting. Is there ANY reporter willing to ask Bill Clinton about RAPING me?”

It’s been 20 years since the Monica Lewinsky scandal shocked our nation and we found ourselves in the middle of ridiculous debates over the definition of the word “is,” while we famously saw Bill Clinton’s finger wagging at us on TV, saying he’s going back to doing the business of the American people.

What worked in the 90s to defend such behavior isn’t going to work in the age of #MeToo. You can’t play defense. You can’t dodge and distract. Excuses are exhausted, overused and thoroughly refuted.

In the age of #MeToo, your only recourse is to own it. Women are speaking out, and men are being held accountable. If Bill Clinton wants to fully rehab his image he needs to stop defending the indefensible and start admitting that he was part of the problem.

#YouToo Bill – you’re part of the problem, you’re not the victim.",politics
"New York Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez portrays herself as ""a normal, working person,"" but one of her positions may have helped 150 people lose their jobs.

After enduring mockery for declaring Sunday that a walk in a national park was an example of democratic socialism, Ocasio-Cortez lamented Monday the shutting down of an iconic New York coffee shop that closed mostly due to a higher minimum wage – which Ocasio-Cortez supported.

“The restaurant I used to work at is closing its doors. I swung by today to say hi one last time, and kid around with friends like old times,” the congressional candidate reminisced on Twitter. “I’m a normal, working person who chose to run for office, because I believe we can have a better future.”

The Coffee Shop in Union Square, which became especially famous after regularly appearing on HBO’s “Sex and the City,” will close down this fall after nearly 28 years in business. Co-owner and President Charles Milite announced the decision to shut the doors to its 150 employees last month.

But unlike what Ocasio-Cortez wants you to believe about the closing down, it wasn’t the result of greedy capitalists trying to squeeze the workers, but rather government regulations that forced the company to go bust.

“The times have changed in our industry,” Milite told the New York Post last month. “The rents are very high and now the minimum wage is going up and we have a huge number of employees.”

SOCIALIST CANDIDATE OCASIO-CORTEZ ONCE SAW HERSELF AS SMITHIAN CAPITALIST, VIEWEED FAMINISM AS ‘RELIC’

Ocasio-Cortez, who rose to prominence after defeating top Democrat Joe Crowley in the party’s primary election in June, has campaigned on the issue of minimum wage, arguing for a $15 federal minimum wage, up from $7.25, insisting that it won’t have any negative consequences for businesses.

During her appearance on “The Daily Show” with Trevor Noah, Ocasio-Cortez was pressed whether her suggestion of $15 minimum wage wouldn’t tank the economy. She cited the example of Seattle, which voted four years ago to gradually increase the hourly minimum to $15 over several years.

Yet Seattle is a troubling case, as research from the University of Washington's School of Public Policy and Governance found that the higher minimum wage led to significant job declines and actually left the poorest worst off in the city, the Washington Post reported.

The study estimated that low-wage jobs in the city dropped by 9 percent since 2016 and “hourly wages in such jobs increased by around 3 percent.” As a result, the study said, the city’s average worker lost $125 a month thanks to the minimum wage hike.",politics
"A slew of FBI and DOJ officials could face a reckoning when Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Thursday releases a long-awaited report detailing his review of the Hillary Clinton investigation during the 2016 presidential race.

“I think it's going to put a lot of the missing pieces in this giant puzzle together,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., predicted Wednesday on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”

For more than a year, Horowitz has been reviewing the FBI and DOJ’s actions related to its investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.

The report is not expected to address the DOJ and FBI’s actions taken in the Trump-Russia investigation, or relitigate the Clinton case itself. But it will mark the most definitive accounting of the email probe to date, looking at -- among other things -- whether “certain underlying investigative decisions were based on improper considerations.”

DOJ TO RELEASE LONG-AWAITED REVIEW OF CLINTON PROBE ON THURSDAY

Among the top Justice Department and FBI officials expected to face scrutiny in Horowitz’s report: former FBI Director James Comey, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and FBI official Peter Strzok.

James Comey

Horowitz’s investigation has looked at whether it was improper for Comey to make a public announcement about not recommending prosecution over the Clinton email arrangement. He memorably faulted Clinton and her associates for being “extremely careless” with classified information.

A draft version of the report called Comey ""insubordinate,"" calling him out for making that statement as well as notifying Congress the probe was being reopened days before the election, according to ABC News.

Comey, in his newly released memoir, also admitted drafting a statement exonerating Clinton months before federal investigators interviewed the former secretary of state as part of the email probe.

Comey has used his book to defend the move, describing it as a routine step that any competent investigator might take. “Any investigator or prosecutor who doesn’t have a sense, after nearly a year of investigation, where their case is likely headed, is incompetent,” Comey wrote in his book.

Republicans have raised questions about the draft statement essentially clearing Clinton in the email case. It was written before investigators interviewed Clinton and other key figures. It's unclear whether Horowitz's report will take issue with that statement.

Comey has also faced questions about why the FBI waited weeks to act after the 2016 discovery of thousands of emails on ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner's laptop that potentially were relevant to the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The Weiner emails jolted the 2016 presidential race after Comey told Congress just days before the election that FBI agents had found more of Clinton’s messages. The IG review reportedly will hit FBI leaders for moving too slowly after the messages were found.

Loretta Lynch

Horowitz is likely to scrutinize then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s infamous meeting on an Arizona tarmac with former President Bill Clinton just days before the FBI decided it would not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton.

Lynch has claimed she and Clinton spoke of only “innocuous things” during their controversial meeting on a tarmac in Arizona, calling it a “chance encounter.”

But the tarmac meeting fueled Republican complaints that Lynch had met with the husband of an investigation subject improperly, just days before the probe into her personal email server was completed with no charges filed.

Comey has publicly taken issue with the meeting, saying the tarmac meeting was a “deciding factor” in his decision to act alone to update the public on the status of the Clinton probe.

Andrew McCabe

Horowitz’s review has already put McCabe in legal jeopardy. The Justice Department’s internal watchdog sent a criminal referral for McCabe in April to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington after Horowitz’s finding that McCabe leaked a self-serving story to the press and later lied about it to Comey and federal investigators. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired him in March.

A portion of that report on McCabe was previously released to Congress, but more information involving the former deputy director is likely in Horowitz’s report.

Horowitz also is reviewing whether McCabe should have recused himself from the probe early because of his family’s ties to the Democratic Party. (He did not do so until a week before the election.) And he could face scrutiny over the delay in reviewing messages on Weiner's laptop. McCabe knew as early as September 2016 of the emails, but the bureau did not obtain a warrant to review them until the following month.

This week, lawyers representing McCabe filed a suit against the Justice Department and FBI on Tuesday, alleging that they wouldn't give up files connected to his ouster.

Peter Strzok

The inspector general’s review months ago uncovered a trove of anti-Trump texts from FBI official Peter Strzok, who famously called Trump an “idiot” and texted about an “insurance policy” against a Trump presidency.

Strzok was reassigned to the FBI's human resources division following revelations that he was romantically involved with FBI employee Lisa Page and exchanged the politically charged texts. Page has since left the bureau.

Strzok, a former deputy to the assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, also was involved in changing Comey’s early draft language about Clinton’s actions regarding her private email server from “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless.”

Republicans are expected to seize on the report’s findings and argue the existence of an anti-Trump bias.

“I think it's most important that the American people see this report because I think it's going to shed light on how the Federal Bureau of Investigation mishandled this whole investigation with regard to former secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton,” Goodlatte said.

But Democrats are already pushing back.

“I’m calling it now: no matter what the DOJ IG report actually says, President Trump’s sycophantic supporters will try to claim that somehow he is the victim of FBI wrongdoing & bias,” Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal tweeted Wednesday. “Talk about fake news.”

"A Democratic Socialist candidate for New York Senate faces questions after reports emerged that she falsified her biography, including claims about being an immigrant and Jewish, while her previous work shows she was a Christian conservative advocate.

Julia Salazar, a progressive Democrat affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America, has been touted as the next Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a young and hip socialist who would move the party further to the left. She also received an endorsement from the New York governor candidate Cynthia Nixon.

But Salazar came under fire last week after an expose in Tablet magazine, which examined Salazar’s claims about her biography.

The candidate for state office previously told multiple outlets that she’s an immigrant from Colombia and noted that her family immigrated to the U.S. when she was young. Her father, she said, was Jewish but the family had little contact with the American Jewish community after they arrived to the country.

“I immigrated to this country with my family when I was very little. In Colombia, my mom raised me as a single mother,” she also said during one of her events on the campaign trail.

“As a proud immigrant myself, I know how important it is to protect the rights of immigrants and ensure that everyone can fully participate in the life of New York State,” Salazar’s campaign website read just last month, before it was recently changed to “as a proud daughter of an immigrant father myself.”

According to Tablet, the candidate is not an immigrant. She was born in Miami and her mother had U.S. citizenship. Her brother, Alex Salazar, confirmed to the magazine that both he and his sister were born in the U.S.

Salazar, despite being caught on camera saying she’s an immigrant, pushed back against the expose, saying she “made it crystal clear that I had been born in Miami.” She blamed a campaign staffer for the error on her website.

Her claims about being Jewish also came under scrutiny. She claimed Jewish blood through her father, saying his Jewish ancestors were expelled to Latin America from medieval Spain. But her father’s 2009 funeral service notes that the service was held in a Catholic Church in Florida, Tablet reported.

“There was nobody in our immediate family who was Jewish … my father was not Jewish, we were not raised Jewish,” the brother said. He added that one of their father’s brothers was a Jesuit priest.

'There was nobody in our immediate family who was Jewish … my father was not Jewish, we were not raised Jewish.' - Alex Salazar

The magazine also obtained messages from her university years that show Salazar claiming her mother’s family was from Israel and describing herself as a descendant of Christian Israelis. The New York Senate candidate also once wrote that her grandfather moved from Mandatory Palestine to Colombia 10 years before the state of Israel was founded.

The Tablet reports that some of her acquaintances said that Salazar had undergone conversion to conservative Judaism in just two months, though such a process could take much longer.

Salazar called the questioning of her religion “a long history of bigoted policing of the identity of Jewish people of color, particularly people with patrilineal Jewish heritage or Jews who converted. I’m sad to see that brought into my campaign.”

The candidate’s progressive credentials were also called into question after revelations that she was actually a conservative Christian activist on campus who worked on pro-Israel and pro-life initiatives.

In 2012, Salazar appeared on Glenn Beck’s show, claiming “there are probably several” professors at the Columbia University who are using “using the classroom as their podium to spread lies about the State of Israel, to delegitimize the State of Israel, and to spread propaganda to Columbia students.”

The candidate has since come out against the Jewish state and supported organizations that campaign for boycott, disinvestment, and sanctions against Israel.

In 2012 and 2013, she was the president of Columbia Right to Life, the campus' top anti-abortion group. Her now-deleted social media posts often alluded to her Christian faith.

Salazar didn’t address her change in political views.",politics
"President Trump’s supporters say they have no regrets, one year after putting the billionaire businessman into the White House.

A POLITICO/Morning Consult poll reports that 82 percent of Trump voters surveyed would vote for him again if they could. The numbers reflect a base that continues to stand by the bomb-throwing commander-in-chief, as his supporters did through multiple controversies during the 2016 campaign.

The president has struggled to notch any major legislative achievements during his first year in office and has been bogged down at times by the Russia meddling probe – but he’s vowing to get a major tax reform package passed soon, and touting economic gains so far under his administration.

12 MONTHS OF TRUMP

The POLITICO poll shows a slightly smaller percentage of Hillary Clinton voters – 78 percent – who say they would back the Democratic nominee again.

However, the poll leaves unclear whether the Trump voters will remain so loyal in 2020. The percentage who say they would back Trump in three years dips slightly, to 76 percent, in the survey.

The poll of 1,900 registered voters was conducted Oct. 26-30. The poll has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.",politics
"President Trump blasted the conservative mega-donor Koch brothers on Tuesday as a “total joke” and promised supporters he would be “a puppet for no one,” amid rising tensions over trade and other administration policies.

“The globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade. I never sought their support because I don’t need their money or bad ideas. They love my Tax & Regulation Cuts, Judicial picks & more,” Trump tweeted.

“I made them richer. Their network is highly overrated, I have beaten them at every turn. They want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from being taxed, I’m for America First & American Worker -- a puppet for no one. Two nice guys with bad ideas. Make America Great Again!”

The president’s tweets come after the advocacy network created by billionaires Charles and David Koch announced they would not support Republican Senate candidate for North Dakota, Kevin Cramer. The Koch brothers also did not endorse Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

A spokesman for the Koch Network responded to the president's criticisms later Monday morning.

""We support policies that help all people improve their lives,"" spokesman for the Koch Network James Davis said in a statement to Fox News. ""We look forward to working with anyone to do so.""

The Washington Post reported that at a reception held by the Koch network over the weekend, officials revealed a new approach —distancing themselves from the GOP and becoming less focused on partisan politics.

Charles Koch said he “regrets” support for some Republican lawmakers in recent years.

“We’re going to be more strict on holding someone accountable if they say they’re going to be for the principles that we espouse, and then they aren’t,” Charles Koch said, according to the Washington Post. “Our organization is happy to support anybody. We’d love for there to be more Democrats to support these ideas and these issues.”

The Koch brothers have been highly critical of Republicans in recent months, slamming the GOP for not doing enough to curb government spending in their $1.3 trillion spending bill adopted in March. They have specifically criticized the White House over Trump’s “protectionist” trade policies, which they fear could trigger a U.S. recession in addition to a looming international trade war.

Trump’s policies also have not always been in line with the Kochs' political group — Americans for Prosperity. But the group says it still plans to focus resources and funds to help Republican Senate candidates in Tennessee, Florida and Wisconsin.

According to Forbes, each Koch brother is worth approximately $60 billion, tying for 8th richest person in the world.

"As soon as President Trump concluded his successful summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Finland on Monday, the Washington swamp and liberal media launched a concerted effort to falsely portray our president’s positive foreign policy achievement in the most negative light possible.

The rabidly anti-Trump reporters covering the summit were single-mindedly obsessed by the collusion myth – determined to prove that the Trump presidential campaign colluded with Russia to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential race, despite no real evidence to support this cockamamie theory.

Sadly, the media had little interest in delving into important issues that Presidents Trump and Putin discussed, including nuclear nonproliferation, destroying ISIS, ending the civil war in Syria, preventing Iran from building atomic bombs, and the security of Israel. Reporters could barely acknowledge the positive sight of former Cold War adversaries talking about peace and areas of agreement.

Instead, like hunters searching for the Holy Grail, the Abominable Snowman, Bigfoot or a herd of unicorns, reporters at the summit were determined to prove the existence of something that doesn’t exist – a grand conspiracy orchestrated by the Kremlin that put Donald Trump in the Oval Office.

President Trump’s political opponents are behaving like a rudderless mob, void of policy ideas, and hell-bent on provoking a confrontation.

To help quell the hysteria over one word he said at his summit press conference, President Trump clarified Tuesday that he misspoke when he appeared to indicate he was uncertain about whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election campaign.

The president explained that while he said the day before that “I don’t see any reason why it would be Russia” that meddled, he actually meant to say “wouldn’t” – giving his comment the opposite meaning. It was a small verbal slip like all of us have made at one time or another, yet the media and anti-Trump politicians fell over themselves to denounce the president as if he was a modern-day Benedict Arnold.

President Trump set the record straight Tuesday. “I accept our intelligence conclusion that Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election took place,” the president said, making a definitive statement that should put to rest any doubt about his confidence in the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion.

The president then added, as he said many times, that “there was no collusion at all” between his campaign and Russia to influence the outcome of the election.

President Trump’s political opponents are behaving like a rudderless mob, void of policy ideas, and hell-bent on provoking a confrontation. President Trump, on the other hand, tried to lower the temperature and manage expectations heading into the summit and following the meeting.

Trump – the businessman, negotiator, and change agent – labeled Putin a “competitor” and stated quite reasonably that he’s a believer in diplomacy and meeting with world leaders. That’s a positive shift from some of the icy foreign policy positions taken by the United States in the recent past that prevented a dialogue between the two nations with the most nuclear weapons.

Unfortunately, it’s all too clear that the left has no interest in seeing America succeed under President Trump. Hillary Clinton – still not over losing the supposedly “unlosable” election to Trump in 2016 – even attacked the president in a tweet before the summit by questioning his loyalty to the nation he is so proud to lead.

Not long ago this type of vicious partisan assault on the eve of an important international meeting would have been unimaginable. Someone should ask Clinton whose side she’s on – but don’t hold your breath.

The media won’t ask tough questions of Clinton any sooner than they’ll ask President Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, or former CIA Director John Brennan about why they sat back and did nothing about the Russian meddling that happened on their watch.

Those questions would elicit answers that don’t fit into the left’s narrative about Russia. The media steer clear of sore subjects like Hillary Clinton’s failed “reset” in relations with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in 2009; Obama’s enhanced “flexibility” hot-mic overture to then-Russian President Sergei Medvedev in 2012; and the Uranium One controversy involving Clinton.

All these issues would inevitably raise questions about the anti-Trump tall tale of collusion with Russia. So they are swept under the rug. The intellectual dishonesty coming from the left and its allies in the media is simply jaw-dropping.

The spectacle of Joe Biden – who accused GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney of being “stuck in a Cold War mentality” in 2012 – now attacking President Trump and labeling Russia “our number one adversary” is the height of hypocrisy.

Everyone knows that the Obama administration was “all in” for a new Democrat-led alliance with Russia until it was politically expedient not to be. That’s the harsh reality that the liberal media isn’t honest enough to report.

On the heels of Friday’s indictments in the Russia probe being conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the anticipation surrounding the Trump-Putin summit reached a fever pitch. Right on cue, unhinged Democrats called on President Trump to cancel the summit, an absurd demand he rightly brushed aside.

If the president had decided to cancel the meeting on account of the charges of Russian meddling, he would have been criticized by the same politicians for showing weakness toward Putin.

Instead, in the face of unrelenting criticism, President Trump soldiered on and did what he thought was right. Few will admit it, but this is what leadership looks like; nothing fazes this president – and that’s one of the reasons he was elected.

Before the Trump-Putin meeting, the media focused on Russian meddling in our election like a heroin addict in need of a fix. Would Trump ask about it? What would Putin say? Would it be covered in the meeting or at the press conference?

As it turns out, President Trump did the right thing. He confronted the Russian president about the recent indictments and what Russia did in 2016. Putin, like a true former KGB agent, denied everything. The media and the left, of course, were not satisfied. They’ll never be satisfied as long as Donald Trump is in the White House.

The truth is that all the left really cares about is delegitimizing President Trump, so that’s what the media focus on, ad nauseam. Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election is an issue that the left cannot and will not let go of, and there’s nothing that President Trump can say or do that will ever satisfy these opponents.

President Trump states regularly that he has full confidence in our intelligence agencies, but the media choose to ignore this – prompting his statement Tuesday reiterating his position.

The media also ignore that fact that President Trump has ordered tough sanctions on Russia and has expelled 60 Russians from the United States in response to the poisoning in England attributed to the Russians.

Going forward, President Trump must continue to separate the two issues everyone in Washington is focused on. Yes, Russia meddled in the election and President Obama failed to stop it. But no, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, and Russian meddling didn’t affect the outcome of the election.

Now it’s time for the hyperventilating to stop and for cooler heads to prevail. As a nation, we must acknowledge this necessity, take meaningful steps to stop any future outside election meddling, and move on.

It’s in our national interest to let President Trump focus on his agenda to Make America Great Again, and not tie him up in endless investigations responding to baseless accusations. The torrent of angry rhetoric, absurd charges and hatred directed at this president has reached a dangerous level that is harming our nation.",politics

India's top court on Thursday struck down a colonial-era law that made homosexual acts punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a landmark victory for gay rights in the world's largest democracy.

In a unanimous decision, five Supreme Court justices ruled that the law was a weapon used to harass members of India's gay community and resulted in discrimination. After the ruling, opponents of the law danced and waved flags outside the court.

""We feel as equal citizens now,"" activist Shashi Bhushan said. ""What happens in our bedroom is left to us.""

The law — known as Section 377 — held that intercourse between members of the same sex was against the order of nature. The five petitioners who challenged the law said it was discriminatory and led to gays living in fear of being harassed and prosecuted by police.

Arvind Datar, the attorney for the petitioners, argued in the court that the penal provision was unconstitutional because it provides for the prosecution and sentencing of consenting adults.

A New Delhi High Court in 2009 declared Section 377 unconstitutional, but that decision was overturned in a ruling by three Supreme Court justices in 2013 on the grounds that amending or repealing the law should be left to Parliament. But lawmakers failed to take action and in July the government told the Supreme Court to give a ruling in the case.

Over the past decade, gays have gained a degree of acceptance in parts of deeply conservative India, especially in big cities. Some high-profile Bollywood films have dealt with gay issues. Still, being gay is seen as shameful in much of the country.

Karan Johar, a Bollywood producer and director, said Thursday's verdict was history in the making.

""So proud today! Decriminalizing homosexuality and abolishing section 377 is a huge thumb up for humanity and equal rights! The country gets its oxygen back!"" he wrote on Twitter.",world

In a corner of northwestern Syria packed with nearly 3 million people, the government and its opponents are preparing for a final, bloody showdown.

The campaign for Idlib, the opposition's only remaining stronghold in the country and now a refuge for over a million displaced Syrians, is likely to be the last major theater of battle after seven years of brutal civil war.

It is also potentially the most dangerous.

The U.N. and aid workers are bracing for disaster, warning that up to 800,000 people are in danger of renewed displacement if a government offensive gets underway. A massive military buildup in nearby areas suggests an assault — at least to regain parts of the province — may be imminent.

Turkey, which backs the rebels in Idlib, has warned against a military solution and is reportedly negotiating with Russia in an effort to avoid a full-scale offensive.

Concern is mounting meanwhile over the potential use of chemical weapons, and the Russian navy is building up its presence in the Mediterranean Sea.

Here's a look at what lies ahead for Idlib:

THE OPPOSITION'S LAST REFUGE

After seven years of war, President Bashar Assad has largely quashed the popular revolt that erupted against his family's decades-long rule in 2011, which was inspired by the Arab Spring protests that swept the region that year.

Idlib now amounts to the last refuge for the opposition, as well as the al-Qaida-linked insurgents that have fought alongside it.

President Bashar Assad is determined to retake Idlib, and has vowed to eventually bring all of Syria back under his government's control.

At one point, the opposition controlled parts of Syria's largest cities and most of the territory around Damascus, the capital. But Russia launched an air campaign in support of Assad in 2015, and Iran has sent thousands of military advisers and allied militiamen to aid his forces. In the last year alone, the government has forced its opponents out of Damascus, Homs, Daraa, and Quneitra, four provinces and cities that were longtime opposition strongholds.

As government forces advanced, they offered residents and one-time opponents the choice either to reconcile with Assad's rule or board buses for Idlib, where al-Qaida-linked groups have eclipsed the moderate opposition.

Tens of thousands of people chose to leave to Idlib, fearing they could be face imprisonment, forced conscription, or worse at the hands of government forces.

Now they have nowhere left to turn, after other opposition pockets have collapsed, and Turkey has largely sealed its borders to new refugees.

___

THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS FACTOR

The U.S. State Department has said it will hold Moscow, an ally of Damascus, responsible if government forces use chemical weapons in the battle for Idlib.

U.N. investigators have already attributed several chemical attacks in Syria to government forces, including one attack using the nerve agent Sarin gas against the Idlib town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017.

That attack prompted the U.S. to carry out a rare strike against a Syrian military installation. In April, the U.S., France and Britain launched punitive strikes after a chlorine gas attack on a suburb of Damascus then held by the opposition. The U.S. also holds the government responsible for a Sarin gas attack that may have killed over 1,000 people in August 2013 in the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus.

Syria's government denies ever using chemical weapons and says it disposed of its stockpiles under an agreement brokered by the U.S. and Russia after the 2013 Ghouta attack.

Chemical attacks have only accounted for a small fraction of the estimated 400,000 people killed in the civil war.

Now, Moscow and Damascus say the U.S. is planning to fabricate a chemical attack or encourage rebels to execute one, as a pretext to launch renewed strikes against Assad's forces. But there is scant evidence that rebels have used chemical weapons in the past, and the U.S. has shown little appetite for taking forceful military action against the government.

On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said Washington was in ""active"" communication with Russia about preventing another chemical attack.

A CATASTROPHE IN THE MAKING

The U.N. says a battle for Idlib would cause a humanitarian catastrophe. With Turkey closing its borders to new refugees, it is unclear where civilians might go. Many are already living in camps in Idlib amid dire conditions, with 2 million in need of humanitarian aid.

The leaders of Russia, Iran, and Turkey are slated to meet next week in the northern Iranian city of Tabriz, where many are hoping for a deal to avert a calamitous battle over Idlib.

In the meantime, the government is amassing its forces around the province, and Russia has positioned at least 10 warships and two submarines off the coast, according to Russian media reports.

If a campaign does proceed against Idlib, it is likely to follow the formula set in previous battles. Russian and Syrian warplanes would launch wave after wave of devastating airstrikes, before government forces besiege towns and cities, forcing residents to surrender or starve.",world
"The Catholic Church is reeling after a grand jury report in Pennsylvania found that possibly more than 1,000 children in six dioceses had been sexually abused by about 300 priests or higher ranking officials.

On top of that, the report said that bishops and other top church officials had tried to contain the public outcry and liability by covering up the crimes, which Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro claimed “went all the way to the Vatican.”

But the report, and the Vatican’s subsequent tepid response, has exposed a split within the Holy See which threatens to bring down Pope Francis just five years after he replaced Pope Benedict XVI.

ITALY JOURNALIST SAYS HE HELPED PEN BOMBSHELL AGAINST POPE

Several days after the news broke and dominated U.S. headlines, the Vatican released a statement. Using uncharacteristically strong language for the Vatican, even on such serious issues as child abuse, the Holy See spokesman said to victims that “the pope is on their side.”

Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said the incidents of abuse graphically documented in the grand jury report were “betrayals of trust that robbed survivors of their dignity and their faith.”

“The church must learn hard lessons from its past, and there should be accountability for both abusers and those who permitted abuse to occur,” he said.

POPE'S ALLEGED COVER-UP PIVOTS ON WHEN, IF SANCTIONS IMPOSED

But for many Catholics and long-time Vatican observers, the acknowledgment of the criminal behavior was too little, too late.

The Freedom From Religion Foundation, a group that describes itself as agnostics and atheists (including former Catholics) are running a full-page ad later this week in The New York Times urging people to leave the Church.

“Priests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing; they hid it all,” the ad says. “Six dioceses, three hundred predatory priests, a staggering 1,000-plus victims. No bishops indicted. The pope’s response? All words, no action — except, insultingly, to call on the faithful to ‘pray and fast.’”

The advert in the Times comes after Francis was taken to task on Sunday by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the former Vatican ambassador to the U.S.

POPE REFUSES TO COMMENT ON CLAIMS HE IGNORED MCCARRICK ABUSE ACCUSATIONS

In a damning 11-page letter released to ultra-conservative media in Europe, during the pope’s trip to Ireland over the weekend, Vigano accused the pontiff of being among Church hierarchy who knew – and did little or nothing towards disciplining – about rumored sexual indiscretions by ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick.

In fact, Vigano asserted, McCarrick was rehabilitated from sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI, promoted and made part of high-profile Vatican events even as rumors about him swirled.

The timing of Vigano’s accusations have been seen by the progressive pope’s supporters as a deliberate attempt by more conservative factions to undermine his tenure, which has seen him reach out to homosexuals and divorced parishioners.

FORMER VATICAN DIPLOMAT CALLS FOR POPE FRANCIS TO RESIGN, CLAIMS HE IGNORED SEX ABUSE ALLEGATIONS

Compounding matters, Francis told reporters on Sunday that he ""won't say a word"" about Vigano's memo, saying it ""speaks for itself"".

Francis burst onto the global stage as a papal rock star of sorts in 2013, with people dubbing him a breath of fresh air. The first South American-born pope routinely went to prisons and washed inmates’ feet, spoke to the homeless, and expressed respect and fondness for those cast aside by society.

David Gibson, a former veteran religion writer and now director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University, says the backlash against Francis for the slower than preferred response to the abuse allegations is “unfair.”

Gibson said that Francis, admittedly, has been on a learning curve as far as dealing with a decades-old crisis of sex abuse by priests and high-ranking church officials.

“He seems to be too much a creature of the Old Church,” Gibson said. “But he’s been better than his predecessors. He believed in churchman before victims. He moved very carefully, giving deference to the church. That was evident in Chile, and the sex abuse allegations there.”

Francis defended a bishop in his home country who was accused by victims of knowing about and ignoring abuse they suffered.

Then, he did an about-face, practically forcing Chilean bishops to resign for their “grave defects” in handling the abuse reports.

Furthermore, Francis accused them of destroying evidence, obstructing justice and putting children in harm’s way around pedophiles.

The move was noted as the first such time the Vatican initiated a bold action to hold bishops accountable for covering up sex abuse, and it did it very publicly.

“Pope Francis wrote a very heartfelt apology, he said ‘I was wrong and I must change,’” Gibson said. “No pope ever had fired a bishop.”

The scandals increasingly coming to the surface are “a legacy he inherited from the last 60 years.”

However, that does not excuse Pope Francis from slow responses now, Gibson said.

“He is the pope, so it’s his responsibility to fix it.”

Victims and their advocates for decades have lamented that top Catholic churchmen repeatedly put the reputation of the church ahead of obligations to protect children from harm from pedophile priests.

Groups of Catholic abuse survivors say swift and public actions are needed immediately to change the culture in dioceses and parishes that allow such abuses to still occur.

“As he arrived in Ireland Pope Francis has once again missed another opportunity to seriously and concretely tell the world what he is going to do about the child sexual abuse and cover up crisis,” said Peter Isely, founding member of Ending Clergy Abuse (ECA), a worldwide organization of abuse survivors and human rights activists who calling on Roman Catholic Church to end clergy abuse. “This crisis is a global crisis. It not only effects Ireland, where there has been so much suffering, but in every corner of the globe where the Catholic Church is present.”

“What is most important about the Pope’s speech is what he did not say. He did not say that he will change church law so that any priest who has sexually abused a child will be permanently removed from ministry,” Isely said. “He did not say that any bishop who has been proven to have covered up sex crimes will be removed from office. Until he at least says and does that, nothing else he says and does will be effective in ending the crisis.”",world
"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is reportedly considering allowing states to use federal funds to buy firearms for educators.

The New York Times, citing multiple people with knowledge of the plan, reported Wednesday evening that the department is focusing on a federal education law that does not explicitly prohibit the purchase of firearms through federal funds called the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants.

It would be up to DeVos to approve of any such measure, The Times reported.

The Department of Education did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News.

A spokeswoman for the education department told the paper that the agency is “constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety,” but did not specifically address whether the department is considering granting states the option to use federal funds for weapons purchases.

“The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios,” the spokeswoman said.

Former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -- who was injured during a 2011 shooting at a meet-and-greet event in Tuscon, Az. – said arming teachers puts “children in even more danger.”

“Arming teachers is not a solution. It recklessly puts American children in even more danger,” Giffords tweeted late Wednesday evening. “We can forge a better path. It’s time for Americans to find the courage to fight for our own safety.”

Stricter gun control laws have been at the forefront of hotly debated topics in Washington since a gunman opened fire at a high school in Parkland, Florida, and killed 17 students and faculty members.

President Trump in February expressed his support for arming “gun adept teachers with military or special training experience,” as a way to prevent another “savage sicko” from causing mass causalities.

He also advocated for gun control measures, such as raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21.

Rockets slammed into the heart of the capital of Kabul on Tuesday as President Ashraf Ghani delivered a speech marking a Muslim holiday, the latest in a series of brazen attacks that highlighted Afghanistan's deteriorating security.

No injuries were reported from the mortar rounds that hit in the diplomatic quarter; one struck near the presidential palace, another near a NATO compound and the U.S. Embassy, according to police official Jan Agha.

In response, Afghan helicopter gunships bombed the house from which the rockets were believed to have been launched. Hours later, at least two militants were reported killed.

The booms of the mortar rounds echoed during the live broadcast of Ghani's speech commemorating the Eid al-Adha holiday, and the president interrupted his remarks to say: ""If they are thinking the rocket attack will keep Afghans down, they are wrong.""

The attack came amid an unrelenting wave of deadly violence across the country in recent weeks and dealt another blow to Ghani's efforts to revive peace talks to end the 17-year war. On Sunday, he had offered a holiday cease-fire, saying it would only take effect if the Taliban reciprocated.

An affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility, saying its fighters had fired the shells that struck the heavily fortified Kabul neighborhood. There was no immediate comment from the Taliban.

The Interior Ministry launched an investigation into the security breach.

Former Interior Minister Noorul Haq Olomi blamed political squabbling inside Ghani's government for distracting the president's attention from security matters, allowing the near-daily violence by insurgents to continue.

""The deaths every day of our security forces is a big calamity for our country,"" said Olomi, now a defense analyst.

He also blamed neighboring Pakistan, saying that the international community has done too little to force Islamabad to shut down safe havens for terrorist groups inside its territory. The U.S. and Afghanistan also have routinely alleged that Pakistan harbors Taliban insurgents,

Pakistan denies the allegation and says some of the deadliest terrorist attacks on its territory have been plotted by the Islamic State affiliate based in Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan.

Afghan security forces, aided by U.S. air support, have repeatedly struck IS redoubts in Nangarhar in recent months with some success, although the group still has been able to carry out attacks. Last week, it claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed 34 high school graduates, most of them Shiites, who were taking university entrance exams in Kabul. The IS affiliate is known as the Islamic State in Khorasan Province, the ancient name of an area that once spanned parts of Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia.

In Islamabad, new Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the rocket attack.

""We are with the Afghan people and government to fully defeat this cowardly thinking,"" Khan said in an Urdu language statement.

The Kabul neighborhood where the mortar rounds hit is one of the most secure in the capital, where embassies and government buildings are surrounded by concrete blast walls and coils of razor wire. Many streets near the U.S. Embassy are closed off, along with those near sensitive government and military installations.

""It is clear that those that carried out the attack are enemies of Afghanistan, enemies of Islam and enemies of peace,"" said Lt. Col. Martin O'Donnell, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

Police had noticed a suspicious vehicle and followed it to a mud-brick house near the sprawling Eid Gah mosque, where hundreds were praying during the Eid al-Adha holiday, said police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai. He told The Associated Press that the militants were believed to have fired the rockets from the house.

A helicopter gunship bombed the location, destroying the house and the vehicle.

After the explosions, witnesses reported sporadic shooting could be heard from the area, though it wasn't clear who was firing. The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety.

O'Donnell said four attackers were killed and five surrendered. But Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said two attackers were killed.

Danish initially said that two Afghan security forces were wounded in a subsequent firefight, but later revised the number to six, including some civilians. The gunbattle also ignited a fire that burned down a nearby market, he said.

The U.N. special representative to Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, pleaded for peace on the Muslim holiday.

""To allow all Afghans to commemorate this auspicious celebration, I strongly urge the parties to the conflict to demonstrate good will, to respect this time of joy and tolerance and to refrain from resorting to violence,"" he said.

On Monday, the Taliban ambushed a convoy of buses and abducted scores of people, including women and children. Afghan forces rescued nearly 150 of them.

Earlier this month, the insurgents launched a coordinated assault on Ghazni, a strategic provincial capital only 120 kilometers (75 miles) from Kabul. It took Afghan forces, aided by U.S. airstrikes and advisers, more than five days to drive them out in a battle that killed at least 100 security forces and 35 civilians, while about 200 militants were killed.

Both the Taliban and the Islamic State group are fighting to overthrow the U.S.-backed government and impose a strict form of Islamic rule. But they are fiercely divided on leadership, tactics and ideology, and routinely clash with one another.

The U.S. and NATO officially ended their combat mission at the end of 2014 but have repeatedly come to the aid of Afghan forces in recent years to prevent the Taliban from advancing into major cities. The U.S. has long insisted on an ""Afghan-led"" peace process between the government and the Taliban but recently has indicated it would be open to direct talks with the insurgents.

The Taliban have sent delegations to Uzbekistan and Indonesia in recent weeks. On Tuesday, Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said the Taliban have accepted an invitation to attend talks on Afghanistan in Moscow on Sept. 4.

All this has raised the Taliban's diplomatic profile while carrying out the deadly attacks. The Taliban say they met with a U.S. diplomat in Qatar this month for what the group described as ""preliminary"" talks, and said it expected further negotiations.

"A Washington state lawmaker was fired from his job as a university professor last week amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior directed at female students.

State Rep. Matt Manweller, a Republican, was terminated from his position as a political science professor at Central Washington University on August 14.

A report from an investigator hired by the public university said it found a “preponderance of the evidence supported a finding that Manweller engaged in a pattern of unprofessional and inappropriate behavior with gender-based and sexual overtones with female students and former students from 2004 to 2017.” The report was published by The Seattle Times.

Manweller is accused in the report of asking inappropriate and personal questions, physical touching, communicating with students with “sexual or romantic overtones” and “offering an educational benefit in exchange for sex.”

The report includes concerns raised by 15 current or former female students as well as witnesses.

Manweller has denied any wrongdoing. In a video posted to his YouTube channel, he called the allegations “trivial” and “blown way out of proportion.” He also said the investigation “sensationalized … everyday events,” such as offering someone a glass of wine or standing near a person.

One former student, in particular, alleged that when she was 19 years old, she was struggling to pass Manweller’s class because her 3-year-old son needed to be hospitalized. She said she was in his office one evening when he sat close to her and placed his hand on her knee.

ARIZONA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE REBUFFS CALLS TO DROP OUT OF RACE OVER DECADE-OLD RAPE ALLEGATION

“There’s always a way for you to get an A in this class,” Manweller allegedly told her.

The student said it “was clear to her that he was offering her other ways to earn an A that did not involve course work, and understood this to mean a sexual favor for an easy A,” the report said. The young woman ultimately withdrew from the class.

Manweller denied touching his student inappropriately and said if he had offered assistance in his class he would have been referring to something like extra credit work.

“He said it was not quid pro quo, and he was very sorry if [the student] took it that way,” the report said.

The report also includes multiple other female students who said they received “unwanted attention” from Manweller. In particular, some accused him of looking at their bodies in ways that made them feel uncomfortable.

SOME LEGISLATURES LACK SEXUAL MISCONDUCT POLICIES, TRAINING

Another student – who never took one of his classes – said she became a babysitter for Manweller’s family. She said he would often comment on her appearance and want to talk to her for long periods of time when he arrived home, making her uncomfortable. There were times, she said, when she would leave without getting a check because she wanted to go.

Manweller often offered her alcohol when he got home, she claimed, and one night she accepted a glass of wine. She said they talked about school and work, but “he kept inching closer to her, and eventually his hand was touching the side of her knee.” She said she left and cried on the way home.

Manweller said he never discussed her appearance but did talk to her upon arriving home in order to “debrief” how his children were while he was gone since they have food issues and separation anxiety. He said he and his wife would sometimes offer her a glass of wine, but denied ever inappropriately touching her.

RAPE KIT ACCESS WOULD EXPAND UNDER BIPARTISAN BILL, AS VICTIMS SEEK 'CARE AND JUSTICE'

Other female students said Manweller would ask them personal questions.

This is the third time the Central Washington University has investigated Manweller for misconduct, he said in the video, accusing the school of only investigating him during years when he’s up for re-election.

“I’ll tell you this. There is nothing in that report I have to apologize for. The things that are true, are not inappropriate. And the things that are inappropriate, are not true,” Manweller said.

According to a Seattle Times report in December, one former student told investigators Manweller invited her to a bar in 2006. She said she went with another female friend because she would eventually need a letter of recommendation from him. At the bar, she said he asked her inappropriate questions, including asking the two to have a threesome.

Manweller denied the allegations, saying he’s “never propositioned a student.”

After reports of inappropriate behavior began to surface, some students came to his defense, including a former babysitter, the Columbia Basin Herald reported earlier this month.

In a statement announcing Manweller’s termination, Central Washington University criticized Manweller for having “chosen to make public statements minimizing, trivializing, even ridiculing, the female students who have come forward with legitimate concerns.”

Manweller is up for re-election this year. He has said he plans to sue the university and investigator.",politics
"An Argentine police officer received a promotion Friday after a photo showing her breastfeeding a malnourished baby at a hospital went viral.

Celeste Ayala, a mother of three, was on duty at the Sor Maria Ludovica Children’s Hospital in Buenos Aires last week when she heard the baby’s cries, according to The Guardian. Marcos Heredia, one of Ayala’s colleagues, captured the moment and posted a photo to Facebook.

“I want to make public this great gesture of love that you made today with that baby, who you did not know, but for who you did not hesitate to act like a mother,” Heredia wrote on Facebook. “Things like that are not seen every day.”

The baby seen with Ayala was one of six siblings who were malnourished, local media reported. Ayala said she noticed the baby was hungry before asking to breastfeed him.

“It was a sad moment, it broke my soul seeing him like this. Society should be sensitive to the issues affecting children; it cannot keep happening,” she told Cronica.

Ayala was promoted from officer to sergeant, Cristian Ritondo, Buenos Aires provincial security minister, announced on Twitter.

“We wanted to thank you in person for that gesture of spontaneous love that managed to calm the baby’s cry. That’s the type of police we’re proud of, the police we want,” he said.",world
"Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime personal attorney, admitted Tuesday to violating federal campaign finance laws by arranging hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal “at the direction” of then-candidate Trump.

In entering the plea, Cohen did not specifically name the two women or even Trump, recounting instead that he worked with an “unnamed candidate.” But the amounts and the dates all lined up with the payments made to Daniels and McDougal.

In total, Cohen pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion, one count of making false statements to a financial institution, one count of willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count of making an excessive campaign contribution.

Cohen could have received up to 65 years in prison if convicted of all charges. However, as part of his plea deal, Cohen agreed not to challenge any sentence between 46 and 63 months. The deal does not involve a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors.

Cohen is set to be sentenced Dec. 12.

In a statement, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said: “There is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the President in the government’s charges against Mr. Cohen. It is clear that, as the prosecutor noted, Mr. Cohen’s actions reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time.”

Cohen attorney Lanny Davis said his client had pleaded guilty “so that his family can move on to the next chapter.

""This is Michael fulfilling his promise made on July 2nd to put his family and country first and tell the truth about Donald Trump,"" Davis added. ""Today he stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election. If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn’t they be a crime for Donald Trump?""

Separately, Davis told Fox News that Cohen’s involvement in the Trump-Russia investigation does not end with the plea deal, but in fact ""it is only the beginning.""

Davis added that Cohen will speak with whoever is investigating the president to make sure the truth about Trump gets out.

Cohen’s home, office and hotel room were raided in April by federal investigators looking into his financial dealings, including his alleged practice of paying women to stay silent about claims they had affairs with now-President Trump. Daniels and McDougal have both claimed they had sex with Trump while he was married, which the president denies.

Cohen was behind the $130,000 payment to Daniels, and recently released a tape of a conversation from September 2016 of him and Trump discussing the possible payment to McDougal.

Trump denied to reporters in April that he knew anything about Cohen’s payments to Daniels, though the explanation from the president and Giuliani have shifted multiples times since.

In May, Giuliani initially told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Trump had reimbursed Cohen for the payment to Daniels. Giuliani later claimed that the president was unaware the money would be going to Daniels and said Trump repaid Cohen for unspecified “expenses.”

Deputy U.S. Attorney Robert Khuzami told reporters that in January 2017, Cohen had begun seeking reimbursement for the payments to both women by “submitting invoices to the candidate’s company” — believed to be the Trump Organization — that falsely indicated that Cohen had provided legal services in the year 2017.

“In fact ... [Cohen] provided no legal services for the year 2017, and it was simply a means to obtain reimbursement for the unlawful campaign contribution,” Khuzami said.

According to prosecutors, Cohen sent reimbursement invoices to “one or more” members of the Trump Organization requesting $35,000 per month.

The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2016 that McDougal was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc. -- the parent company to the National Enquirer — for the rights to the story, but it never ran.

According to court documents, Cohen reached an agreement with “Chairman-1” — believed to be American Media Chairman and CEO David Pecker — to pay $125,000 for “the rights to the non-disclosure portion” of McDougal’s agreement with American Media. Prosecutors say Cohen created a shell entity, “Resolution Consultants LLC” to execute the transaction.

An agreement was signed, but according to prosecutors, “Chairman-1” contacted Cohen in early October 2016 before any money could be exchanged and told him ""that the deal was off and that Cohen should tear up the assignment agreement."" The documents say that Cohen did not do so and the agreement was found during the April search of his office.

Cohen also admitted Tuesday to underreporting his income by $4.1 million on his tax returns for the years between 2012 and 2016. Of that amount, $2.5 million was interest payments from a personal loan; $1.3 million was income from his taxi medallion business; $100,000 was income from brokerage commissions; and $200,000 was from “consulting fees.”

The investigation into Cohen was handled by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York after it was referred to them by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office.

Trump has repeatedly blasted developments in the Cohen investigation. In April, after Cohen’s offices were raided, he declared “attorney-client privilege is dead.” Last month, he slammed both the FBI raid and Cohen’s taping of discussions about paying McDougal as “inconceivable.”

“Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of,” he tweeted. “Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal.”

But, possibly in reference to questions about whether he had violated any campaign finance laws, Trump added that “your favorite President did nothing wrong!”

Before the election, Cohen had been a trusted member of the Trump organization, working out of an office in Trump Tower next to one used by his boss.

He raised millions for Trump’s campaign and, after being interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee last year, told Vanity Fair that Trump had no part in the suspected Russian conspiracy to tamper with the election.

However, Cohen appeared to distance himself from Trump last month. In an interview with ABC News, which was referenced by Davis Tuesday, Cohen said that “my wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will. I put family and country first.”

"The State Department announced Friday that the U.S. will end all aid to UNWRA (the United Nations Relief and Works Agency), the U.N. body dedicated to serving Palestinian Arabs it designates as refugees. The action is a victory for justice, eventual peace and a wise use of U.S. taxpayer dollars.

While the U.S. has spent billions of dollars over the past 70 years to support generation after generation of Palestinian Arabs, the Trump administration will eliminate its annual contribution of $360 million, marking a new, vital approach in U.S. foreign policy. American aid covered almost a third of UNWRA’s $1.1 billion annual budget last year.

After Arab nations rejected the 1948 United Nations partition plan for British-ruled Palestine, which divided the land between Arabs and Jews, Israel’s Arab neighbors mobilized their armies and invaded the new Jewish state of Israel in an effort to wipe it off the map. Miraculously, Israel won the war.

According to UNWRA, an estimated 750,000 Arabs fled their homes, many to neighboring countries. Using conventional wisdom, that number should now stand in the tens of thousands still alive some 70 years later.

However, UNWRA claims that today 5.3 million Arabs are eligible for its services, owing to an inconceivable definition exclusive to Palestinian Arabs, whereby refugee status extends to the descendants – the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren – of the original refugees.

The U.S. decision recognizes only those Palestinians who left Israel 70 years ago as refugees.

If managed carefully, this policy and its follow-up provisions would constitute the only real opportunity to ensure prosperity for Palestinian Arabs, safety for Israel’s citizens and stability for the United States and its regional allies.

The new U.S. policy exposes the absurdity of the perpetual, uninterrupted refugee population increases claimed by UNWRA. It will pour cold water on the idea of a “right of return,” the Palestinian Arab demand that any final status agreement afford 5.3 million Arabs the ability to flood Israel – a country of 8.8 million people, including an existing population of 1.8 million Arabs.

A sudden Arab population explosion in Israel is unacceptable, as it would end Israel’s status as the only Jewish state on the planet.

The U.S. decision could also spell the end for UNWRA, an agency responsible for implementing a lethal and violent educational curriculum that teaches hatred of Israel and urges children to become terrorists. UNWRA has been instrumental in radicalizing Palestinian Arab youth, selecting teachers that moonlight as Hamas terrorists and utilizing textbooks that call for the mass murder of Jews.

Shuttering UNWRA would provide the international community with an opportunity to create a peaceful curriculum for UNWRA’s 500,000 existing students, who could be instructed to pursue professions that would enable them to support their families and help create more prosperous economies.

The U.S. decision will also put significant pressure on Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, which collectively house 60 percent of the so-called UNWRA refugees. For 70 years, Palestinian Arabs and their descendants in these countries have been denied citizenship and equal employment opportunities as a ploy to control their influence in society, limit their social contributions and maintain an excuse to continue hostilities against Israel.

The U.S. policy shift and its potential successes will not come without major resistance and inevitable violence. But the move by the Trump administration will establish the framework for a long and difficult process for Palestinian Arabs, who must be willing to form new lives for themselves, similar to those created by the more than 850,000 Jewish refugees who fled or were expelled from Muslim-majority countries between 1948 and the mid 1970’s.

Ultimately, the U.S. could not continue to support a Palestinian Arab population that will eventually surge into the tens of millions and will not accept attempts by Israel’s neighbors to perpetuate a crisis that should have never reached this point.",world
"Philadelphia has announced it will end a major information-sharing contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), bowing to intense pressure from activist groups and drawing immediate condemnation from federal officials.

The move means that the city will not renew a decade-long arrangement to share real-time arrest information with ICE when it expires at the end of August.

The information, contained in Philadelphia’s Preliminary Arraignment Reporting System (PARS), alerts authorities when new arrests are made, and includes arrestee's full names, countries of origin, and Social Security numbers. While PARS does not indicate immigration status, Democrats charged that ICE nevertheless abused the database to investigate potential immigration violations.

Anyone who interacts with law enforcement is entered into the database, including those who are arrested, victims and witnesses, with some limits on what ICE officers can view.

“I cannot in good conscience allow the agreement to continue,” Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney told the Philadelphia Inquirer about Friday's announcement. ""We're not going to provide them with information so they can go out and round people up.""

He added: ""If I could abolish ICE, I would. But we can abolish this contract, and we are.""

The city's decision comes after ""Occupy ICE"" protesters established a tent-filled encampment outside city hall and staged weeks of raucous demonstrations.

PORTLAND VOWS TO CLEAN UP 'DISGUSTING' OCCUPY ICE CAMP, CALLING IT A BIOHAZARD

On Wednesday, more than a dozen activists stormed city hall and blockaded an internal stairwell for more than an hour after police rebuffed their attempt to rally directly outside the mayor's office.

U.S. Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman called the decision irresponsible and said the city will end up ""harboring criminal aliens.""

""Sanctuary-city policies make American communities like Philadelphia less safe by putting the rights of criminal aliens over the safety and security of American citizens,"" Waldman said. ""Despite the misguided action taken by Philadelphia today, DHS will continue to work to remove illegal aliens and uphold public safety.""

""Sanctuary-city policies make American communities like Philadelphia less safe."" - DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman

Kenney claimed immigration officers are wrongly using the database to go to homes and workplaces of people who list foreign countries of origin and arresting other people who are in the country illegally but are otherwise not accused of any other crimes.

But in a statement to Fox News, ICE officials reiterated that the agency had not breached its agreement with Philadelphia in any way, including by engaging in racial profiling or accessing information without the city's approval. They added that they were ""deeply disappointed"" in the city's decision, saying the city had not pointed to any specific instances of alleged misconduct by ICE.

Two of three stakeholders in the contract — the city, the district attorney and the city courts — had to vote to end it. District Attorney Larry Krasner had said this month he would oppose the contract's renewal, saying it promotes oppressive practices.

Kenney said the federal agency's actions have created fear and distrust in the city's immigrant community.

FEDERAL JUDGE DEALS SETBACK TO TRUMP'S CRACKDOWN ON SANCTUARY CITIES

The Trump administration has long railed against sanctuary cities like Philadelphia, but its efforts to put words into practice have run into legal trouble.

On Friday, a federal district court judge ruled that the administration cannot withhold public safety grants from Chicago to pressure the city to stop providing sanctuary to immigrants, saying the policy amounted to unconstitutional coercion by the federal government. And last year, a federal judge issued an injunction against Trump's executive order denying federal funding to sanctuary cities on Tenth Amendment grounds.

In Philadelphia, Kenney was videotaped last month dancing and singing, ""We're a sanctuary city!"" after a similar court win there.

ICE has previously said it would focus on immediate deportation for people in the country illegally who had felony convictions or who were suspected of felonies.

Calls to abolish the agency -- including some from top Democrats and presidential hopefuls Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- grew into a frenzy after the Trump administration's ""zero-tolerance"" illegal immigration policy resulted in more separations of adults from accompanying minors at the border. Though Trump signed an executive order to end the separations, reuniting some families remains a work in progress.

Still, efforts to get rid of ICE have fizzled since earlier this month, when the GOP-controlled House called a vote on a resolution expressing support for the agency.

The vote effectively dared Democrats to go on the record with opposition to the agency. The measure passed, with a total of 133 Democratic representatives voting ""present"" -- amounting to a procedural refusal to take a position despite weeks of heated anti-ICE rhetoric from party leaders.

WATCH: PHILLY MAYOR DANCES, CELEBRATES CITY'S SANCTUARY CITY STATUS

As a sanctuary city, Philadelphia had already limited cooperation with immigration enforcement. It won't release inmates to ICE without a judicial warrant.

Philadelphia entered into the contract in 2008, city solicitor Marcel Pratt said, and revised it in 2009 to shield witness and victim information from the agency, as well as to eliminate immigration status.

In a termination letter sent to ICE on Thursday, Pratt said the contract ""has created the false perception that the city is willing to be an extension of ICE.""

Several colleges with ties to ICE are also being pressured to split with the agency. Earlier this month, students and community activists marched at Northeastern University in Boston, demanding the school cancel a multimillion-dollar research contract with ICE. The school was hired by ICE to research U.S. technology exports.

"An Alabama state senator has invited the California-based In-N-Out hamburger chain to his state after some California Democrats called for a boycott of the chain over donations made to the state's GOP.

State Sen. Phil Williams, a Republican from Rainbow City, Ala., tweeted his invitation Thursday night.

""Hey #InNOutBurger c'mon to Alabama! We love burgers, and we love #Republicans! #alpolitics,"" Williams tweeted.

In-N-Out reportedly donated $25,000 to the California Republican Party earlier this week, and the revelation has caused many who identify as Democrats — or just not Republican — to demand a boycott of the chain.

""Tens of thousands of dollars donated to the California Republican Party ... it's time to #BoycottInNOut - let Trump and his cronies support these creeps... perhaps animal style!"" Eric Bauman, chairman of the California Democratic Party, tweeted Thursday.

This is not the first time In-N-Out has donated to the GOP. In 2016 and 2017, the company donated $30,000 to the Republican Party for general expenses, Los Angeles magazine reported.

But the fast-food restaurant has also given thousands of dollars to support the Democratic PAC ""Californians for Jobs and a Strong Economy,"" a pro-business group created by Democrat David Townsend in 2009.

In-N-Out was founded in Baldwin Park, Calif., in 1948. Its headquarters is currently in Irvine, Calif. It operates restaurants in six states: California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Texas and Utah.

"The Trump administration said Thursday that more than 700 children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border remained apart, hours before a court-imposed deadline to reunify them.

In a court filing, the Justice Department said 1,820 children ages 5 and up had been discharged from the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Of those, 1,442 were reunited with their parents in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), while another 378 were released ""in other appropriate circumstances.""

A federal judge had given the administration until the end of Thursday to reunite more than 2,500 separated children with their parents, guardians or other sponsor. The separations took place under President Trump's so-called ""zero tolerance"" border policy, which called for criminal prosecution of anyone caught crossing the U.S. border illegally.

The administration said that 711 separated children had parents or guardians who are ""either not eligible for reunification or not available for discharge at this time."" Of those children, 431 are listed as having parents ""outside the United States."" Another 120 had parents who waived reunification, while an additional 173 had parents who were released to the interior or whose location was ""under case file review.""

A Justice Department spokesperson told Fox News that the government would meet the court deadline, saying, ""The expected total number of eligible potential class members in ICE custody [seeking to be reunited], who will not have been reunited [by the end of the day]: 0.""

Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who represents the separated families, said the government should not be congratulating itself for meeting its ""self-defined"" deadline.

""These parents and children have lost valuable time together that can never be replaced,"" he said. ""We're thrilled for the families who are finally reunited, but many more remain separated. The Trump administration is trying to sweep them under the rug by unilaterally picking and choosing who is eligible for reunification.

""We will continue to hold the government accountable and get these families back together.""

On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News' ""Special Report"" that the Trump administration was ""on track"" to meet the reunification deadline. At a hearing that same day, U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw praised the administration's efforts at completing the reunifications.

""When we meet on Friday, reunification will have been completed,"" he said. ""This work has to be highlighted and commended.""

However, Sabraw also criticized the government for a lack of information about the parents' whereabouts, calling it the effect of ""a policy that was in place that resulted in large numbers of families being separated without forethought as to reunification and keeping track of people.""

Meanwhile, Homeland Security's internal watchdog said it would review the separation of families, along with the conditions at Border Protection facilities where migrant children are held, in response to scores of congressional requests to do so.

For the last two weeks, children have been arriving steadily at ICE locations in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico to be reunited with parents. Faith-based and other groups have provided meals, clothing, legal advice and plane and bus tickets. The families are generally released, and parents are typically given ankle-monitoring bracelets and court dates to appear before an immigration judge.

Both sides were due in court Friday, when the judge was going to decide whether to ban deportations of families for seven days after they are reunified so that parents have time to discuss their options.

Late last month, Sabraw ordered a nationwide halt to family separations, which Trump effectively did on June 20 following an international outcry. Sabraw issued a 14-day deadline to reunite children under 5 with their parents -- 30 days for older children.

On Friday, family attorneys are to begin turning their attention to those who weren't reunited — parents who had a criminal record, parents who were no longer in the U.S. and children who were handed over to other sponsors, Gelernt said.

"A former beauty queen accused of hiring a hit man to kill her wealthy husband is set to go on trial in Puerto Rico on Tuesday.

After a lengthy international manhunt, Áurea Vázquez Rijos, dubbed “The Black Widow” by local media, is finally set to appear in federal court, where jurors will decide if she had a part in Adam Anhang’s slaying, the BBC reported.

The jury selection began Tuesday, and a clerk with the federal court told CBC it could last until Friday.

Vázquez is a former Miss Puerto Rico Petite winner, according to a Global News profile about the battle to bring her back to Puerto Rico.

Anhang, 32, a Winnipeg native who made his money in real estate and gaming software, was found beaten and stabbed to death in San Juan in September 2005.

On the night he was killed, Anhang and Vázquez, met to discuss their pending divorce after six months of marriage.

Anhang’s death at first appeared to be the result of a robbery gone wrong.

But prosecutors say Vazquez tricked her husband into meeting up, and had him killed, the BBC reported. Vázquez had signed a prenuptial agreement with Anhang that would have cost her millions if the two divorced.

Anhang’s net worth was estimated to be $24 million.

MOLLIE TIBBETTS, MISSING IOWA STUDENT, FOUND DEAD, SOURCES SAY

A kitchen worker, Jonathan Román Rivera, initially was found guilty of murdering Anhang, but Rivera’s conviction was overturned after a witness to the killing came forward, the BBC reported.

Another man, Alex “El Loco” Pabón Colón, eventually was indicted for the murder, and pleaded guilty after cooperating with investigators. Colón said Vázquez offered him $3 million to kill Anhang.

A U.S. grand jury charged Vázquez in June 2008 with ordering the hit on Anhang. She refused to cooperate with police, and filed a civil lawsuit against Anhang’s family shortly after his death, seeking $1 million in damages and millions more from his estate. A judge dismissed the suit.

Vázquez vanished from Puerto Rico, but she turned up a few years later in Spain, and was arrested in June 2013. Vázquez, who fought extradition, said she hadn’t known U.S. authorities were looking for her.

While in prison awaiting extradition, she became pregnant and then married the baby’s father. But Vázquez was sent to Puerto Rico in 2015 to stand trial.

Prosecutors have said they will not seek the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole if convicted.

"Donald Trump charged President Barack Obama on Wednesday with being the founder of the Islamic State during a campaign rally in Florida.

""In many respects, you know, they honor President Obama,"" Trump said during a campaign stop in Fort Lauderdale. ""He is the founder of ISIS.""

Last week, his campaign tried to draw financial links between the Clinton Foundation and the terror group. Wednesday, he called Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton the group's “co-founder.”

Trump has long accused Obama and Clinton for pursuing Middle East policies that created a power vacuum in Iraq that was exploited by Islamic State. He had criticized Obama for announcing he would yank U.S. troops out of Iraq, which Obama critics believe created the instability in which extremist groups thrive.

The White House had yet to comment on Trump’s remarks.

The Islamic State group began as Iraq's local affiliate of Al Qaeda, the group that attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. The group carried out massive attacks against Iraq's Shiite Muslim majority, fueling tensions with Al Qaeda’s central leadership. The local group's then-leader, Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed in 2006 in a U.S. airstrike but is still seen as the Islamic State group's founder.

The Trump campaign alleged in a statement last week that the Clinton Foundation ties to a corporation “funding” ISIS.

The campaign detailed financial contributions the Clinton Foundation received from a cement-making company called Lafarge. The same statement cited reporting in French media outlets that the company had entered deals with the Islamic State and other armed groups in Syria to protect its interests there.

“More than any major presidential nominee in modern history, Hillary Clinton is tied to brutal theocratic and Islamist regimes. Now we learn she has accepted money from a company linked to ISIS,” Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said in a statement.

Trump brought up the accusation during his rally in Florida to a raucous crowd.

He railed against the fact that the Orlando shooter's father, Seddique Mateen, was spotted in the crowd behind Clinton during a Monday rally in Florida, adding, ""Of course he likes Hillary Clinton.""

"The first two weeks of the trial of former Donald Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort on 18 counts of tax evasion and bank fraud charges have failed to implicate Trump or his campaign in any alleged criminal conduct.

Prosecutors working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller – who is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election – are expected to call their final witness Monday at Manafort’s trial in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia. If convicted on all counts, Manafort could face a maximum sentence of 305 years in prison.

So far we’ve learned that the prosecution’s star witness, former Manafort employee Rick Gates, is a liar, a serial adulterer and a thief who embezzled funds from Manafort.

And we’ve learned that Manafort is alleged to have evaded paying taxes on income that he and Gates earned through secret offshore bank accounts, shell companies and fraudulent bank loans.

But when it comes to the mandate given to Mueller on May 17, 2017, we’ve learned absolutely nothing. Mueller was charged with investigating “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.”

But neither Gates nor any other witness at the Manafort trial has testified about the Russian election interference or any alleged collusion between the Trump campaign – or Trump himself – with the Russians.

Manafort was with the Trump presidential campaign for just under five months. That’s a tiny sliver of the long career of the 68-year-old.

All of the testimony at the Manafort trial has addressed events that occurred long before Manafort went to work for 2016 Trump campaign. The testimony has focused on Manafort’s and Gates’s activities as alleged “unregistered agents” representing the Ukrainian government starting in 2006.

It would be absurd to argue that Manafort’s other clients in the 12 years since then are somehow to blame for any criminal activity he may have engaged in – and prosecutors aren’t even trying to point the finger at President Trump for these activities.

Manafort’s lawyers claim that Gates was the actual wrongdoer, and they subjected him to a punishing cross-examination.

Under questioning, Gates was forced to admit that he lied to the investigators from the special counsel’s office; embezzled huge amounts of money from Manafort and prior employers; and used the stolen funds in part to pay for extramarital affairs and a “secret life” that included an apartment and a girlfriend in London.

Through their cross-examination, Manafort’s lawyers pushed the idea to the jury that Gates got accountants to falsify Manafort’s tax returns in order to cover up the embezzling. Gates’ fraud apparently included submitting fraudulent personal expenses to the Trump inauguration committee.

Prosecutors tried to counter this with testimony by an FBI forensic accountant, an Internal Revenue Service agent, and Manafort’s own accountant. The accountant testified under a grant of immunity that although she worked with Gates a lot, she believed Manafort “knew what was going on.”

At a prior hearing in this case, the presiding federal judge – the very colorful T.S. Ellis III – said that Mueller is prosecuting Manafort in part because he wants Manafort to “sing” – in other words, testify against President Trump on other unrelated matters.

Ellis said at the earlier hearing that Mueller set out to “turn the screws and get the information you really want” from Manafort. And that information, according to the judge, is what “Manafort can give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump and lead to his prosecution or impeachment.”

It is certainly possible that Gates has some kind of evidence relevant to the Russian collusion allegation that Mueller has not yet made public. And perhaps Manafort also has similar evidence.

But so far at least, Manafort has chosen not to cooperate with Mueller. There was a hint of this in the trial with regard to Gates after the judge issued an order on Thursday at the request of the government. The order sealed portions of a “sidebar” conference the lawyers had with the judge to avoid “revealing substantive evidence pertaining to an ongoing government investigation.”

If Gates is the one with this “secret” evidence against the Trump campaign, the government will face a severe witness-credibility problem, given his embarrassing admissions on the stand in the Manafort trial.

Moreover, Gates admitted that he was threatened with 290 years in prison by Mueller’s team –but was promised he could get off with just probation if he agreed to testify against Manafort. That certainly gives Gates an enormous incentive to allege criminal conduct by Manafort. It’s hard to believe that prosecutors would offer Gates a “get out of jail free card” if he testified that Manafort did nothing wrong.

If Manafort is found guilty of tax evasion and bank fraud, some will try to use his very brief association with the Trump campaign to tar the president. But such criticism would ignore two crucial facts.

First, presidential campaigns are not law enforcement agencies. They have neither the capacity nor the resources to do detailed background investigations on the thousands of individuals who volunteer to work with a campaign.

Second, Manafort appeared to be a successful, ethical businessman. Even the government – including the IRS, the FBI and our intelligence agencies – had no idea that he was allegedly engaging in any wrongdoing for a foreign government through an elaborate scheme of offshore bank accounts and shell companies, until Mueller’s office started investigating him.

In an odd point in the trial, Gates testified that he and Manafort actually told the FBI about their offshore bank accounts in Cypress back in 2014. At the time, the FBI was investigating the former Ukrainian president. Gates and Manafort disclosed the accounts to the agent, because that is how the Ukrainian government paid them.

Yet the FBI apparently did nothing about this and did not notify the IRS. There has been no explanation from the government as to why it took no action at that time.

And surely the Trump campaign cannot be legitimately criticized for not knowing, as the federal government did not know, what Manafort and Gates were supposedly doing vis a vis their personal finances and income tax liability.

The bottom line is this: The Manafort trial is about alleged criminal activity by Manafort and Gates. If Manafort had not spent less than five months working as a volunteer on the Trump presidential campaign he might never have even been charged with a crime.

However, Manafort’s short time in a high-visibility role with the campaign placed all his past activities – having nothing to do with Donald Trump – under the microscope.

In the unlikely event Manafort had been charged with the same crimes but had never joined the Trump campaign his trial would no doubt have attracted only a small amount of media attention. Only his association with Trump has turned his trial into a major news story.

The Manafort trial is complicated. It is receiving enormous news coverage. Most Americans don’t have the time or interest to follow every detail on a daily basis. So it’s understandable that many people assume the trial has something or other to do with President Trump and his campaign.

But that assumption is a mistake. Whether you support President Trump or oppose him, the simple and indisputable fact is that nothing in the Manafort trial so far has revealed any evidence of collusion with Russia or any other misconduct by President Trump or his campaign.

This trial is about Paul Manafort and Rick Gates – not Donald Trump.",politics
"President Trump on Tuesday asked whether Bob Woodward could be “a Dem operative” after an early copy of the veteran reporter’s soon-to-be-released book portrayed a chaotic White House plagued by infighting and bad-mouthing against the president.

Labeling details of the book “a con on the public” with “made up” quotes, the president also seemingly questioned the “timing” of the book reveal.

“The Woodward book has already been refuted and discredited by General (Secretary of Defense) James Mattis and General (Chief of Staff) John Kelly,” Trump tweeted. “Their quotes were made up frauds, a con on the public. Likewise other stories and quotes. Woodward is a Dem operative? Notice timing?”

An early copy of The Washington Post associate editor’s book was obtained by The Washington Post. According to the Post, it portrays a Trump White House that’s filled with second-guessing by members of Trump’s staff, who repeatedly bad-mouth him behind closed doors.

The book is to be released on Sept. 11.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shaj was asked about the book during an interview on Fox News’ “The Story with Martha MacCallum” Tuesday night and said that although he has yet to read it due to his focus on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, “what’s been reported about it is not the White House that I’ve seen.”

He also said that some people referenced in the details “have raised questions about the veracity of things that are being reported in that book.”

WHITE HOUSE FIRES BACK AT WOODWARD BOOK DETAILING INFIGHTING, INSULTS, ‘ADMINISTRATIVE COUP D’ETAT’

A number of other officials from the president’s staff – including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, both of whom were specifically referenced in the book – have come out against it.

The book claims that Mattis told associates of the president that he had the understanding of “a fifth- or sixth-grader,” according to The Washington Post. After Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a chemical attack on Syrians in April 2017, Trump is said to have demanded Mattis launch an assassination attempt.

“Let’s f---ing kill him! Let’s go in. Let’s kill the f---ing lot of them,” Trump reportedly said. But Mattis reportedly told an aide: “We’re not going to do any of that. We’re going to be much more measured.”

In a statement released Tuesday, Mattis said, in part, that “the contemptuous words about the President attributed to me in Woodward’s book were never uttered by me or in my presence.”

Separately in the book, Kelly is reported to have frequently lost his temper, and described Trump as “an idiot.”

“It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in Crazytown,” Kelly said, according to Woodward. “I don’t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I’ve ever had.”

But Kelly also came out against the book, asserting that the comments attributed to him were “not true.”

“The idea I ever called the President an idiot is not true,"" he said in a statement. ""As I stated back in May and still firmly stand behind: 'I spend more time with the President than anyone else, and we have an incredibly candid and strong relationship. He always knows where I stand, and he and I both know this story is total BS. I'm committed to the President, his agenda, and our country. This is another pathetic attempt to smear people close to President Trump and distract from the administration’s many successes.'""

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order to allow children to stay with parents caught crossing the border illegally -- moving to stop the family separations that have triggered a national outcry and political crisis for Republicans.

The measure would allow children to stay in detention with parents for an extended period of time. This comes as congressional Republicans scramble to draft legislation to address the same issue, but face challenges mustering the votes.

In signing the measure, Trump said he wants to keep families together while also enforcing border security. He vowed his administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy for illegal immigration would continue.

Trump, previewing the measure earlier in the day during a meeting with lawmakers, said the move would ""be matched by legislation."" He also said he's canceling the upcoming congressional picnic, adding: ""It didn't feel exactly right to me.""

The separations stem from the administration's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy, which aims to prosecute all illegal border crossers. But because of a 1997 order and related decisions, children cannot be detained for longer than 20 days with the adults.

Sources told Fox News that the executive action by Trump could be seen to run afoul of the 1997 order and would likely draw a lawsuit. But the White House wants to try to take steps to uphold the enforcement of the law, while at the same time lessening the trauma of children being separated from their parents.

In another possible approach, Fox News is told Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will recommend to Trump that he throw his support behind developing House legislation or, if that doesn't pass, a standalone bill to close the “loopholes” regarding family detention. During the order-signing, Nielsen again called on Congress to act.

These measures are being pursued following days of escalating calls from both sides of the political divide for Trump, or Congress, to end the controversial family separation policy.

Rep. Peter King of New York became the latest Republican to join the chorus on Wednesday when he called on Trump to suspend the family separation policy if House immigration legislation does not pass.

Speaking on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom,” King said that while he agrees with the president’s goals in regards to immigration, the current policy of separating migrant children from parents charged with entering the country illegally is “really terrible for families.”

Republicans in both the House and Senate are struggling to shield the party's lawmakers from the public outcry over images of children taken from migrant parents and held in cages at the border. But they are running up against Trump's shifting views on specifics and his determination, according to advisers, not to look soft on his signature immigration issue, the border wall.

“The Democrats do not have a strong policy,” King said on Fox News. “But at the same time we are playing into their hands by allowing this to happen.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said that the House will vote Thursday on legislation to allow families to remain together in Homeland Security custody throughout their legal proceedings.

“We do not want children taken away from their parents,” Ryan said. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart.”

That followed a closed-door meeting in Washington on Tuesday evening, where Trump told House Republicans he is ""1,000 percent"" behind their rival immigration bills. But it's unclear whether any bill has enough support to pass.

Under the administration's current policy, all unlawful crossings are referred for prosecution — a process that moves adults to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and sends many children to facilities run by the Department of Health and Human Services. Under the Obama administration, such families were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings, not requiring separation.

More than 2,300 minors were separated from their families at the border from May 5 through June 9, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

In the House, GOP leaders scrambled Tuesday to produce a revised version of the broader immigration bill that would keep children in detention longer than now permitted — but with their parents.

The major change unveiled Tuesday would loosen rules that now limit the amount of time minors can be held to 20 days, according to a GOP source familiar with the measure. Instead, the children could be detained indefinitely with their parents.

The revision would also give the Department of Homeland Security the authority to use $7 billion in border technology funding to pay for family detention centers, said the person, who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and commented only on condition of anonymity.

In a statement late Wednesday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it has taken ""immediate steps"" to implement the president's executive order.

""As specified in the order, families will not be detained together when doing so would pose a risk to the child’s welfare,"" the statement read in part. ""Additionally, as was the case prior to implementation of the zero tolerance policy on May 5, family units may be separated due to humanitarian, health and safety, or criminal history in addition to illegally crossing the border.”

Even if Republicans manage to pass an immigration bill through the House, which is a tall order, the fight is all but certain to fizzle in the Senate.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York, is adamant that Trump can end the family separations on his own and that legislation is not needed.

Without Democratic support, Republicans cannot muster the 60 votes needed to move forward on legislation.

Democratic reticence and their opposition to a border wall have come under intense scrutiny from Trump, who has blamed the party for the failure of Congress to pass immigration reform.

“It’s the Democrats fault, they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation,” Trump tweeted on Wednesday. “They want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something - it never ends!”

On the Senate side, Republicans are rallying behind a different approach. Theirs is narrow legislation proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that would allow detained families to stay together in custody while expediting their hearings and possible deportation proceedings.

Cruz's bill would double the number of federal immigration judges, authorize new temporary shelters to house migrant families and limit the processing of asylum cases to no more than 14 days — a goal immigrant advocates say would be difficult to meet.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters he's reaching out to Democrats for bipartisan backing.

The discord over the family separation spilled into the streets as protesters clashed with law enforcement in Philadelphia and other cities on Tuesday -- and Democratic lawmakers accosted senior administration officials and even the president himself over the policy.

As Trump walked out of the session in the Capitol basement, he was confronted by about a half-dozen House Democrats, who yelled, ""Stop separating our families!""

Later in the day, protesters heckled Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen as she ate dinner at a Mexican restaurant in Washington, chanting ""Shame!"" and ""End family separation!""

A department spokesman tweeted that during a work dinner, the secretary and her staff heard from a small group of protesters who ""share her concern with our current immigration laws.""

"Saudi women are officially in the driver's seat for the first time ever.

The world's last remaining ban on women driving was lifted just after midnight on Sunday and the mood was upbeat as women would no longer have to rely on their husbands, fathers, brothers and drivers to run errands, go to work and see friends.

""I'm speechless. I'm so excited it's actually happening,"" said Hessah al-Ajaji, who drove her family's Lexus down the capital's busy Tahlia Street after midnight.

Al-Ajaji had a U.S. driver's license before obtaining a Saudi one and appeared comfortable at the wheel as she pulled up and parked. As for the male drivers on the road, ""they were really supportive and cheering and smiling,"" she said.

""I feel free like a bird,"" talk show host and writer Samar Almogren told AFP as she cruised across the capital.

For nearly three decades, outspoken Saudi women and the men who supported them had called for women to have the right to drive. They faced arrest for defying the ban as women in other Muslim countries drove freely.

In 1990, during the first driving campaign by activists, women who got behind the wheels of their cars in the capital, Riyadh, lost their jobs, faced severe stigmatization and were barred from travel abroad for a year.

Ultraconservatives in Saudi Arabia had long warned that allowing women to drive would lead to sin and expose women to harassment. Ahead of allowing women to drive, the kingdom passed a law against sexual harassment with up to five years prison for the most severe cases.

Criticism against women driving has largely been muted since King Salman announced last year that they would be allowed to drive.

Simultaneously, however, at least 10 of the most outspoken supporters of women's rights were arrested just weeks before the ban was lifted, signaling that only the king and his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, will decide the pace of change.

SYRIA ARMY WIDENS OFFENSIVE ON REBEL-HELD AREAS

With state-backed support for the move, many Saudis now say they support the decision allowing women to drive and see it as long overdue.

""This is a great achievement,"" billionaire Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal said as his daughter Reem drove a family SUV, with his granddaughters applauding from the backseat, reports AFP.

""Now women have their freedom,"" he added in a video posted on Twitter.

Not all women are driving at once, though. The overwhelming majority of women in Saudi Arabia still don't have licenses. Many haven't had a chance to take the gender-segregated driving courses that were first offered to women only three months ago. There's also a waiting list of several months for the classes on offer in major cities. And the classes can be costly, running several hundred dollars.

Other women already own cars driven by chauffeurs and are in no rush to drive themselves.

""I will get my driver's license, but I won't drive because I have a driver. I am going to leave it for an emergency. It is one of my rights and I will keep it in my purse,"" said 60 year-old Lulwa al-Fireiji.

While some still quietly oppose the change, there are men openly embracing it.

""I see that this decision will make women equal to men and this will show us that women are capable of doing anything a man can do,"" said Fawaz al-Harbi. ""I am very supportive and, in fact, I have been waiting for this decision so that my mother, my sisters will drive.""

"Editor's note: This column was first published in the Washington Post.

All of Washington is waiting with bated breath to find out whether the Mueller investigation will provide evidence proving that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.

So far, ""Exhibit A"" against President Trump is the meeting Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort had with a group of Russians claiming to have dirt on Hillary Clinton. That meeting should never have happened. When you get an email offering to provide ""very high level and sensitive information"" from the ""Crown prosecutor of Russia"" that could ""incriminate Hillary"" Clinton and is part of ""Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump"" you don't reply by saying ""I love it."" You call the FBI.

The president claims he did not know about the meeting. His former lawyer, Michael Cohen, says he did. Whether he knew is beside the point. Senior officials of his campaign were willing to accept help from Vladimir Putin; they were saved only because the meeting was a bust. The Russians didn't end up providing any dirt.

But as bad as the Trump Tower meeting was, it took place at the request of the Russians. They were the ones who approached the Trump campaign, not the other way around.

By contrast, the Clinton campaign proactively sought dirt on Trump from Russian government sources. They did it through cutouts. In April 2016, Clinton campaign lawyer Marc Elias retained opposition research firm Fusion GPS to compile incriminating information on Trump.

Fusion GPS in turn hired Christopher Steele, a former British MI6 operative with sources among Russian government officials. The result was the salacious dossier, whose sources included ""a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure"" and ""a former top level intelligence officer still active in the Kremlin.""

Steele's work was paid for by Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. That means a paid agent of the Clinton campaign approached Russian officials for damaging material on Trump.

Clinton claims she did not know about Steele's work. It doesn't matter. Imagine if Michael Cohen, or another lawyer paid by the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee, had hired a former British spy with campaign money to collect dirt on Clinton from Russian intelligence and foreign ministry officials. Do you think that everyone in Washington would be saying: ""There's no evidence Trump knew, so no big deal -- nothing to see here?"" Of course not.

Moreover, Clinton officials have defended Steele's actions. Brian Fallon, Clinton's campaign spokesman, has said he ""would have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help"" Steele and would happily have spread dirt obtained from the Russians. ""Opposition research happens on every campaign,"" he told The Post. He also said: ""I am damn glad [Elias] pursued this on behalf of our campaign and only regret more of this material was not verified in time for the voters to learn it before the election.""

In other words, ""I love it.""

We also know that the Democrats covered up their involvement. The dossier was published by BuzzFeed in January, but it was not until Oct. 24, 2017 -- more than nine months later -- that Americans learned it was the DNC and the Clinton campaign that paid for it. If it did nothing wrong, why did Team Clinton leave Americans in the dark about its involvement for so long?

Let's be clear: None of this excuses the Trump campaign's reprehensible behavior in accepting a meeting with Russians claiming to be government agents offering dirt on Clinton. Mueller's investigation is not a witch hunt. If Mueller finds that anyone on the Trump campaign entered into a criminal conspiracy with Russia, they should go to jail.

Furthermore, none of this calls into question the intelligence community's assessment that the Russians wanted Trump to win -- something Putin publicly confirmed in his Helsinki news conference with Trump. But the intelligence community assessment also found that the Kremlin expected Clinton to win. The Russians are not stupid. They were preparing for the prospect of a Clinton presidency, and they played both sides. That's why millions of dollars in Russian cash were sloshing around Clinton World -- including $500,000 Bill Clinton received for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin.

Russia continues to pose a threat. Their goal, according to our intelligence community, was not just to help Trump but also to ""undermine public faith in the US democratic process."" They are playing a long game. If we are to counter the Russian threat, we need to understand its complexities -- and that mean we have to look beyond Trump.",politics
"Tuesday’s Republican primaries brought good news for President Trump and consolidated his hold over the Republican Party. The stunning upset victory of Jeff Johnson over former Gov. Tim Pawlenty in the Minnesota Republican gubernatorial primary drives that point home better than almost anything else.

Pawlenty outspent Hennepin County Commissioner Johnson by better than three-to-one and was heavily favored to win the primary to run for his old job again.

But Johnson was more conservative and was the stronger supporter of President Trump – and that apparently was important to Republican primary voters. Johnson captured 53 percent of the vote to 44 percent for Pawlenty in the gubernatorial primary, with a minor candidate picking up the rest.

When Trump was running in 2016 Pawlenty called him “unhinged and unfit” to be president, after the “Access Hollywood” tape showed Trump bragging about grabbing women. Pawlenty later said he had voted for Trump in the 2016 election and supported most of his policies, but was never seen as a strong backer of the president.

“The Republican Party has shifted,” Pawlenty said Tuesday night. “It is the era of Trump, and I’m just not a Trump-like politician.”

Pawlenty was also vulnerable because after his failed bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination he became a Washington lobbyist for one of the nation’s largest banks – not exactly a popular profession at a time when Trump and his supporters have adopted the slogan “drain the swamp.”

President Trump congratulated Johnson in a tweet Wednesday, writing: “Jeff Johnson of Minnesota had a big night in winning the Republican nomination for Governor against a very strong and well known opponent! Thanks for all of the support you showed me. You have my complete and total Endorsement. You will win in November!”

More evidence of President Trump’s dominance over his party came in the resolution of an election from last week where Trump-backed Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach was finally certified as the Republican nominee for governor Tuesday.

Kobah won the nomination over Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer after provisional ballots were counted.

If nothing else, primary results this year show that the Trump wing of the Republican Party is indeed triumphant. The establishment wing has taken defeat after defeat.

What’s unknown is what impact support from the president will have for GOP candidates in the November election, at a time when he is deeply unpopular with Democratic voters and many independents are cool to him.

On the Democratic side, Tuesday’s primaries tell a more mixed story. If nothing else, Democratic voters chose a diverse group of candidates who will try to showcase broad general-election appeal.

As has been widely reported, the Democrats have nominated the first transgender candidate to ever run for governor in the U.S. – Christine Hallquist in Vermont. They also nominated Ilhan Omar in Minnesota for a U.S. House seat that she is favored to win, which would make her the first Somali-American elected to Congress.

U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, the prominent Muslim and deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was also nominated for Minnesota attorney general, despite a recent allegation of domestic abuse by his ex-girlfriend.

The diversity of the Democratic ticket on balance is probably a good thing for the party. Yet, it underscores the divisions that exist on ideology, messaging and strategy.

Put another way, as the primary season nears a close, the Republicans face a fundamental challenge of articulating a reason why they should maintain control of the House.

The Democrats face their own set of challenges that require a campaign message going forward to unite the disparate factions of their party – between the moderates, the progressives and underrepresented groups that have not traditionally been part of the mainstream conversation.

The Republicans have yet to articulate a clear message on the economy; the Democrats have yet to articulate a clear message at all, aside from the unsatisfying “stand up to and resist Donald Trump”.

How the November elections go both for Congress and state offices around the country will be determined by whether both parties in their own way will be able to come to coherent and cogent messages. These message will have to resonate with an electorate that on both sides is angry, polarized, divided and frustrated with the lack of progress and coherence in its political leaders at all levels.",politics
"The legacy media’s ongoing obsession with President Trump as they work to destroy his presidency has a side benefit for those who want a return of the establishment status quo: There isn’t much coverage of a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. The Washington Times headline said it all, “CDC: 72,000 died from drug overdoses in 2017, 42,000 from opioids.”

Think about that: 72,000 Americans dead, in one year, due to overdoses.

“The death toll is higher than the peak yearly death totals from HIV, car crashes, or gun deaths,” reported The New York Times. “Analysts pointed to two major reasons for the increase: A growing number of Americans are using opioids, and drugs are becoming more deadly …” noted the newspaper.

Many things contribute to drug abuse, but there is one big factor our reliably liberal legacy media ignore: The disaster of ObamaCare and its destruction of our health care infrastructure. We know it made actual health care unaffordable, and then was combined with an economy that further destroyed the options of millions of under- and unemployed Americans.

We then had a president determined to convince the American public that doctors couldn’t be trusted and that a pill could solve your problems. Because when the government is paying for your health care, they need to redefine what “care” really means.

Consider the focus of newly elected President Barack Obama. In 2009, the first year of his first term, Obama began a public campaign to convince people that going to the doctor can be fraught with risk, and even dangerous. He argued on multiple occasions that doctors want to perform surgeries and cut things off just to make a buck.

”‘You come in and you’ve got a bad sore throat, or your child has a bad sore throat or has repeated sore throats,’ President Obama explained at Wednesday’s press conference. ‘The doctor may look at the reimbursement system and say to himself, ‘You know what? I make a lot more money if I take this kid’s tonsils out,’ ” the Wall Street Journal reported in June 2009.

He then immediately moved the argument to pill taking.

” ‘If there’s a blue pill and a red pill and the blue pill is half the price of the red pill and works just as well,’ he asked, ‘why not pay half price for the thing that’s going to make you well?’ ” the Journal reported.

In other words, why trust a doctor when you can take a pill? Besides, it’s less expensive. That’s the point and the irony — saving your life is the only time the government is suddenly interested in cutting costs. Why? Because it means more money for the system and its bureaucrats.

In August 2009, Obama doubled-down on the theme that doctors can’t be trusted and will cut off your foot for the money. At a health care forum in New Hampshire, the president said, “[L]et’s take the example of something like diabetes … if a family care physician works with his or her patient … monitors whether they’re taking their medications in a timely fashion, they might get reimbursed a pittance. But if that same diabetic ends up getting their foot amputated, that’s $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 — immediately the surgeon is reimbursed,” the Media Research Center reported.

The American College of Surgeons pushed back on the smears, stating, “We want to set the record straight. … He stated that a surgeon gets paid $50,000 for a leg amputation when, in fact, Medicare pays a surgeon between $740 and $1,140 for a leg amputation …” noted the ACS. “Three weeks ago, the President suggested that a surgeon’s decision to remove a child’s tonsils is based on the desire to make a lot of money. That remark was ill-informed and dangerous, and we were dismayed by this characterization of the work surgeons do. Surgeons make decisions about recommending operations based on what’s right for the patient,” continued the ACS.

Unfazed, Obama continued his mission to prepare the American people for no actual health care but the less expensive pharmaceutical option. And he became even more blunt.

During a televised health care town hall in 2009 at the White House, The Wall Street Journal reported comments by Obama, “After discussing ways ‘we as a culture and as a society [can start] to make better decisions within our own families and for ourselves,’ he continued that in general ‘at least we can let doctors know and your mom know that, you know what? Maybe this isn’t going to help. Maybe you’re better off not having the surgery, but taking the painkiller.’ “

A great deal of Trump’s time is taken with cleaning up Barack Obama’s and the Democrats’ deadly messes. The horrific report from the CDC of 72,000 overdose deaths last year remind us why Trump declared the opioid crisis a national health emergency.

The opioid crisis is, in part, the result of a nation that lost hope in its future and a bureaucracy that encouraged us into dependency. The good news is, Trump is delivering on his promise to make America great again, and solving the opioid crisis will be part of that continuing success.

"The Americans, British and Arab states can debate whatever Mideast peace plan they want. But nothing can change this pre-eminent fact: Israel is entitled to the land it has, and has been for over 3,000 years. It says so in the most historically accurate document in history: the Bible.

The land of Israel was given by God to the descendants of Abraham. In the Book of Genesis, God appeared to Abraham and said: “I will assign this land to your offspring” (Genesis 15:18-21). In this passage, God made a covenant – an agreement or contract – with Abraham. He repeats this covenant is eternal and unconditional throughout the Bible.

The medieval scholar and Bible commentator Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki) asked: “Why, if the Torah is a book of laws for the Jewish people, does it begin with the history of creation and the lives of our Jewish forefathers?”

Rashi’s answer was that there will be a time when nations will claim the Jews “stole the Land of Israel,” and that the land belongs to others and not them.

Rashi explains that the Bible begins with the story of creation first to establish that all the world belongs to God, and only He has the right to apportion it. And according to the stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses, God promised the land of Israel to the nation of Israel.

God in the Bible makes clear that the land of Israel would not be given to the descendants of Abraham’s son Ishmael, but rather Isaac. In Genesis 17:19, God tells Abraham: “Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac; and I will maintain My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring to come.”

In 17:20-21 God promises to bless Ishmael, the ancestor of the Muslims, and use him to create a great nation, but His covenant to Abraham, which again prominently included the specific promise of land, was to be accomplished through Isaac, not Ishmael, removing any ambiguity.

When people of faith read the Bible, they understand the intrinsic connection between the Jewish people and the land of Israel. In fact, as we note in The Israel Bible, there are over 1,000 verses in the Hebrew Bible connecting the Jewish people with the land of Israel.

But those who question God might also question the historical veracity of the Bible or might incorrectly assume that in a proverbial game of telephone, it could have been altered over the years.

Extensive techniques have been used by Jewish scribes for centuries to make sure the Bible we hold in our hands today is the most historically accurate document from the ancient world. Copying scriptures has always been considered a sacred task and therefore literally thousands of quality-control methods were put into place to ensure reliability.

For instance, the Torah must be written by hand by a scribe, one letter at a time. This process means writing a Torah can take more than three years. And, upon completion, the document is once again checked for accuracy before it can be used.

Further, massive amounts of archeological evidence support the notion that Israel has been in its land for as long as the Bible recounts and that the words of scripture are historically true.

Nearly every archaeological dig in Israel supports the understanding that Jews have had a presence in Israel for thousands of years. Jewish and non-Jewish archaeologists have found coins, pottery and literally full cities that reveal that the Jewish presence in Israel predates any claims that other people in the region may have.

We know that Jews had a presence in the land of Israel until the Romans conquered it. However, the Jews were ultimately driven from the land in two dispersions, in the years 70 and 135.

The Ottoman Turks had control until World War I when they fought against the British on Germany’s side. The British sent troops against the Turks in the Holy Land under the leadership of Bible-believing Christian Gen. Edmund Allenby.

In 1917, Allenby captured Beersheba from the Ottoman Empire and saw himself within striking distance of Jerusalem, hoping to deliver the city as a Christmas present for the British people. The night before the attack against Jerusalem, Allenby prayed that God would allow him to capture the city without damaging its holy places.

That day, Allenby had sent World War I biplanes over Jerusalem on a reconnaissance mission. The Turks had never seen an airplane and when they looked into the sky and saw these planes they did not know what they were and were terrified.

Further, they were told they were going to be opposed by a man named Allenby, whose name in their language means “prophet from God.” The Turks dared not fight against a prophet from God. So the next morning, when Allenby went to take Jerusalem, he captured it without firing a shot.

Not taking the religious significance of his role lightly, when Allenby entered Jaffa Gate on Dec. 11, he dismounted as a sign of respect for the holy city, believing only the Messiah could enter Jerusalem riding on an animal.

It was in those short weeks – 40 days to be precise – between the Battle of Beersheba and the capture of Jerusalem – that the Balfour Declaration was issued by the British government. The declaration was a short letter from British Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour sent to prominent British Jew Baron Lionel Walter Rothschild and expressed the British government’s support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

The Balfour Declaration considered the local inhabitants of Palestine. But most of all, it was addressed to the Christians of England.

“England more than anything needed a moral case in advance of Allenby’s taking Jerusalem, not for the Jewish conscience but for the Christian one,” wrote Barbara Tuchman in her classic book, “Bible and Sword: England and Palestine from the Bronze Age to Balfour.”

That case came from the Bible, because the Bible says Israel belongs to the Jews.",world
"After the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed his razor-thin defeat in the 2000 presidential election, former Vice President Al Gore could have gone to the mat trying to delegitimize the presidency of George W. Bush. Much to his credit, he didn’t.

Democrat Gore had won the popular vote, after all, and the turmoil created by the historic 36-day recount in Florida was all he needed to divide the country for selfish and ideological reasons. But instead of orchestrating a radical leftist resistance, Gore chose country over power.

As difficult as it must have been, Gore was big enough to let it go, accept his loss, and recognize that Republican Bush was the legitimate president of the United States.

In a constitutional republic like ours, every two years there are winners and losers at the ballot box. After a rigorous debate and exchange of ideas, “We the People” make the ultimate decision about who will do the governing until the next election.

Historically, the party that loses the previous election licks its wounds, reboots its message and works with the majority party on issues where common ground can be found. This recipe that is the American miracle has worked remarkably well for 230 years – until now.

Now there’s a permanent Democratic obstruction campaign in Washington and a radical socialist resistance across the country. What’s driving this?

Never before in American history have disgruntled leaders of the minority party sought to deligimitmize and bring down a duly elected president of the United States.

It’s been over 20 months since President Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the historic election of November 2016, but the left will not let it go and it’s doing great damage to our country.

From twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to former CIA Director John Brennan to actor Robert DeNiro to fake news, deranged leftists are determined to try to bring down a presidency. Their attacks are based on a false narrative and they don’t care if they tank our country and system of government in the process.

Just this past weekend, Hillary Clinton continued to question President Trump’s allegiance to America while speaking about his recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Clinton pushed the centerpiece of the Democratic agenda – Russia – when she disingenuously asked her audience: “Why didn’t he (Trump) stand up for our country? In this case it doesn’t seem like our president cares. He’s trying to be friends with Putin for reasons we are all trying to figure out.”

Hillary Clinton is a lot of things. She’s dishonest; she’s the embodiment of entrenched power and the failed Washington status quo; and of course, she’s crooked. However, one thing she’s not is stupid.

Clinton knows full well that Christopher Steele’s phony dossier is a steaming pile of political crap because she paid for the opposition research herself. She also knows that her cronies in the Obama administration pushed the fake dossier through official intelligence, diplomatic and law enforcement channels because a President Hillary Clinton would have rewarded the swamp creatures handsomely.

This is why Brennan and his deep state ilk are running around labeling the leader of the free world a traitor – just because President Trump ruined Hillary’s coronation and swept them all from power.

Clinton also knows that she started her service as Obama’s secretary of state with the failed Russia “reset” in an effort to improve relations between our two countries. She spent four years cozying up to Russia in search of a foreign policy success to hang her hat on and to line her husband’s pockets and the Clinton Foundation with Russian cash.

Hillary relies on her allies in the anti-Trump media to gloss over that wrinkle in their concocted narrative. But the resistance doesn’t stop with her political and media pals. She’s also got Hollywood in full war mode.

The once-respected actor Robert DeNiro goes ballistic and screams “f--- Trump!” at a televised award ceremony. Wealthy comedian Bill Maher waxes on about how great an economic recession would be for Democratic chances to retake power – ignoring the fact that a recession would hurt millions of hardworking American families.

These and other Trump-haters make it clear that the left is united in its effort to get rid of President Trump – no matter what.

Unfortunately for the agenda-less liberals, the Trump economy is on fire and this Friday’s report on the gross domestic product will confirm what the American people already know: President Trump’s pro-growth economic program is working and the results are exceeding all expectations.

It’s a dangerous game being played by national Democratic leaders and it’s not without consequences. Whether it’s turning their backs on our police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, or attempting to provoke a war with Russia, the Democrats have become totally unhinged.

Will any adults in the Democratic Party show some leadership and say it’s time to move past 2016 once and for all? Or will they continue their sad and destructive decline into Third World chaos and socialism?

Make no mistake, Hillary Clinton is fueling the resistance and encouraging others to join in because she can’t get over losing, despite the fact that she pledged to accept the results of the election. It’s still all about Hillary – America be damned.",politics
"The Vatican responded Thursday to the report of hundreds of Pennsylvania priests abusing children, saying in a statement: ""There are two words that can express the feelings faced with these horrible crimes: shame and sorrow.""

""The abuses described in the report are criminal and morally reprehensible,"" the statement read. ""Those acts were betrayals of trust that robbed survivors of their dignity and their faith.""

More than 1,000 children were allegedly abused by more than 300 ""predator priests"" and church officials were accused of covering up the allegations, a grand jury's report released Tuesday said.

""The Church must learn hard lessons from its past, and there should be accountability for both abusers and those who permitted abuse to occur,"" the Vatican said.

Pope Francis himself wasn't quoted in the statement, and there was no mention of demands in the United States among some Catholics for the resignation of Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington. Tuesday's report accused Wuerl of helping to protect some child-molesting priests while he was bishop of Pittsburgh from 1988 to 2006.

Over the course of a two year investigation, launched by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro's office, a grand jury heard several witness statements and reviewed documents from six dioceses in the state.

Most of the Pennsylvania victims were boys, but girls were abused, too, the report said.

The abuse ranged from groping and masturbation to anal, oral and vaginal rape. One boy was forced to say confession to the priest who sexually abused him. A 9-year-old boy was forced to perform oral sex and then had his mouth washed out with holy water. Another boy was made to pose naked as if being crucified and then was photographed by a group of priests who Shapiro said produced and shared child pornography on church grounds.

In nearly all of the cases, the statute of limitations has run out, meaning that criminal charges cannot be filed. More than 100 of the priests are dead, and many others are retired or have been dismissed from the priesthood or put on leave.

STUNNING FINDINGS ON REPORT OF CATHOLIC CHURCH ABUSE: PA. PRIESTS MOLESTED MORE THAN 1,000 CHILDREN

""The cover-up was sophisticated. And all the while, shockingly, church leadership kept records of the abuse and the cover-up,"" Shapiro said at a Tuesday news conference. ""These documents, from the dioceses' own 'Secret Archives,' formed the backbone of this investigation.""

It's possible that the ""real number"" of abused children could be ""in the thousands"" due to missing records or other victims who feared speaking about the allegations, according to the grand jury's report.

The report is taken ""with great seriousness,"" the Vatican said Thursday, adding that they ""unequivocally"" condemn ""the sexual abuse of minors.""

""Victims should know that the Pope is on their side,"" the statement continued.

""The Holy Father understands well how much these crimes can shake the faith and the spirit of believers and reiterates the call to make every effort to create a safe environment for minors and vulnerable adults in the Church and in all of society.""

"When 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came from nowhere to defeat Rep. Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary for New York’s 14th Congressional District, she became a media darling overnight. Time magazine called her win “the biggest upset of the 2018 elections so far.” Within days Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was appearing on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and “The View.”

Now Republicans looking for their own Ocasio-Cortez think they may have found her. Meet Elizabeth Heng—a Republican running in California’s 16th Congressional District. Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Heng is young (33). Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, she’s a racial minority (Cambodian). And like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, she’s a millennial female running against an established male politician.

What makes her race interesting is California’s “jungle” primary system, in which candidates of all parties run against one another. The top two finishers then face off in November’s general election. California’s 16th is a reliably blue district in a state practically synonymous with the term “blue.” But a funny thing happened on the way to this year’s primary: The virtually unknown Republican woman came within 6% of beating incumbent Democrat Jim Costa in a head-to-head matchup.

In the June primary Ms. Heng received 35,080 votes to Mr. Costa’s 39,527. To put this in perspective, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez received 16,898 votes to Mr. Crowley’s 12,880. And again, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had an easier task, trying to prove she’s the best Democrat in a Democratic district. By contrast, Ms. Heng must persuade Democratic voters to give a Republican a chance.

Zimbabwe on Sunday prepared to inaugurate a president for the second time in nine months as a country recently jubilant over the fall of longtime leader Robert Mugabe is now largely subdued by renewed harassment of the opposition and a bitterly disputed election.

The military-backed President Emmerson Mnangagwa, now facing another swearing-in, faces the mammoth task of rebuilding a worsening economy and uniting a nation deeply divided by a vote that many hoped would deliver change.

The 75-year-old Mnangagwa, who took power from his mentor Mugabe with the military's help in November, said ""my door is open and my arms are outstretched"" to main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa after the Constitutional Court on Friday rejected opposition claims of vote-rigging and upheld the president's narrow July 30 victory.

""It is time to move forward together,"" said Mnangagwa, who has promised democratic and economic reforms.

Chamisa on Saturday said he respectfully rejects the court ruling and called the inauguration ""false.""

""They know they can't invite me to a wedding where I was the one supposed to be receiving the gifts,"" he said. His spokesman Nkululeko Sibanda on Sunday said ""we haven't received any formal invitation"" to the inauguration.

The 40-year-old Chamisa has called for dialogue with Mnangagwa but suggested that talks on power-sharing first must acknowledge the opposition leader's alleged victory. ""You cannot steal my goats and then ask me to come and share them with you. Give me the goats first, then we can talk about sharing,"" he said.

Ruling party spokesman Paul Mangwana criticized Chamisa for saying he will snub the inauguration.

""He should grace the event. It is important for nation-building at this critical time. The problem is the (Movement for Democratic Change party) did not give us a good opposition leader, they gave us a schoolboy, so he is playing schoolboy politics,"" Mangwana told The Associated Press.

Upbeat supporters of the president and ruling ZANU-PF party streamed into the 60,000-seat National Sports Stadium in the capital, Harare, many wearing pro-Mnangagwa regalia.

Some said they woke up before dawn to catch buses and trucks ferrying them from villages hundreds of kilometers from the capital.

State-run media said the heads of state of South Africa, Congo and Zambia also were attending. Botswana's former leader and a sharp critic of Mugabe, Ian Khama, attended Mnangagwa's first inauguration in November but will miss this time ""due to prior commitments,"" Botswana's government said.

The mood was less enthusiastic in downtown Harare, an opposition stronghold. ""He is not my president, why should I go?"" asked one resident, Emmanuel Mazunda.

Zimbabwe's economy is in a tailspin. Analysts say Mnangagwa's immediate tasks should include solving severe cash shortages and high unemployment that has forced thousands of people into the streets as vendors. Millions of others have fled the country over the years.

The government badly needed a credible election to end its status as a global pariah, have international sanctions lifted and open the door to investment.

Final reports are pending from dozens of Western election observers invited for the first time in nearly two decades. Observers noted few issues on election day but expressed concern about the ""excessive use of force"" two days later, when six people were killed as the military swept into the capital to disperse protests.

"As federal investigators continue to look into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, prosecutors are also probing an Obama-era sale of a uranium mining company.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions last year directed federal prosecutors to look into the sale of Uranium One to a Russian company – a transaction that President Trump has called the “real Russia story.”

The Hill reported that Russian officials engaged in a “racketeering scheme” to further its energy goals in the U.S. And an FBI informant recently told congressional committees that Russia paid millions to a U.S. lobbying firm in an effort to influence then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to make sure the deal was successful.

What was the Uranium One deal?

In 2013, Rosatom, backed by the Russian state, acquired a Canadian uranium mining company, now called Uranium One, which has assets in the U.S. Uranium is a key material for making nuclear weapons.

Through the deal, Russia is able to own about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity. However, Colin Chilcoat, an energy affairs specialist who has written extensively about Russia's energy deals, said that the company only extracts about 11 percent of uranium in the U.S.

The deal also “doesn’t allow for that uranium to be exported at all,” Chilcoat told Fox News. “It’s not like it’s leaving the U.S. or somehow finding its way to more insidious players.”

The agreement was approved by nine government agencies with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an inter-agency group that reviews how certain foreign investments can impact national security. The State Department under Clinton was one of those agencies, though Clinton told WMUR-TV in 2015 that she was not “personally involved” in the agreement.

Why is it controversial?

Some investors reportedly donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton also received a $500,000 speaking fee in Russia and reportedly met with Vladimir Putin around the time of the deal, Republicans, who are largely critical of the deal, have said.

The FBI had looked into the agreement and uncovered that some Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in nefarious dealings, which included extortion, bribery and kickbacks, The Hill reported. Evidence of wrongdoing by Vadim Mikerin, the Russian official overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion in the U.S. who was eventually sentenced to prison, was discovered by the FBI before the deal was approved, according to The Hill.

Author Peter Schweizer – who wrote about the deal in his 2015 book “Clinton Cash” – told Fox News that there is no evidence that the people involved with approving the agreement knew that the FBI had an ongoing investigation into it.

But White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News “if anyone colluded for a foreign government in [the 2016] election, it was the Clinton campaign [and] the Democrats.”

What did the informant reveal?

Douglas Campbell, the FBI informant, alleged that Moscow paid millions of dollars to a lobbying firm to help Bill Clinton’s charities in order to influence Hillary Clinton, who was then former President Barack Obama’s secretary of state.

Campbell made the claims in a 10-page statement given to the Senate Judiciary Committee, House Intelligence Committee and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Campbell said Russian nuclear officials “told me at various times that they expected APCO to apply a portion of the $3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the Russians to provide in-kind support for the Clinton’s Global Initiative.”

""Your real Russia story is uranium."" - President Donald Trump

“The contract called for four payments of $750,000 over twelve months,” Campbell said in the statement. “APCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the US-Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement.”

APCO Worldwide is a global public affairs consulting agency. In a statement to Fox News, APCO said Campbell’s allegations are “false and unfounded.”

“The key issues at stake in this investigation are all about intent and knowledge: was there an intent to influence official business, and, if so, did the recipient take the money in exchange for taking official action,” Jamil Jaffer, a former counsel in the Justice Department and the director of the National Security Law and Policy Program at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, told Fox News.

But Jaffer said the credibility of the so-called informant will also come into play.

“Was this a foreign agent or criminal who turned? Was this a private individual the FBI placed inside [the deal]? Was this a government employee? All these factors, plus the level of the informant’s access to relevant information, will make a big difference here,” Jaffer said.

But what does this deal have to do with the Russia investigation?

Multiple congressional committees, as well as the Justice Department, are looking into possible Russian collusion in the 2016 presidential election – and ties between Russians and Trump’s campaign.

""That's your real Russia story. Not a story where they talk about collusion and there was none. It was a hoax. Your real Russia story is uranium,"" Trump has said.

Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the probe into alleged Russian interference in the election, was the head of the FBI when it investigated Rosatom officials’ extortion and corruption.

And the investigation was led by then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, The Hill reported. Rosenstein is now the deputy attorney general; McCabe, until last month, was the deputy director of the FBI.

Mueller's investigators in the Russia probe report to Rosenstein.

The special prosecutors instructed by the Justice Department to investigate “certain issues” pertaining to the Uranium One deal will also report to Rosenstein and Sessions, according to a letter obtained by Fox News.

Congressional committees are looking into whether Mueller informed the Obama administration, particularly those tasked with approving the Uranium One deal, prior to CFIUS approval.

In her attempt to discredit reports of the controversy surrounding the Uranium One deal, Clinton said Trump and “his allies,” are diverting from the investigation.

“The closer the investigation about real Russian ties between Trump associates and real Russians … the more they want to just throw mud on the wall,” she said. “I’m their favorite target, me and President Obama.”

British officials announced Wednesday that they have charged two Russian men with the nerve agent poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury — though they held out little hope of being able to bring them to justice.

The Crown Prosecution Service said the men, who entered the country under the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are being charged in absentia with conspiracy to murder, attempted murder and use of the nerve agent Novichok.

Prosecutor Sue Hemming said the U.K. would not ask Moscow to extradite the men because Russian law forbids extradition of the country's citizens. Britain has issued domestic and European arrest warrants for the suspects, meaning they can be detained if they leave Russia for another European country.

But assistant commissioner Neil Basu, head of counterterrorism at London's Metropolitan Police, conceded it was ""very, very unlikely"" police would be in a position to arrest them any time soon.

Police say the suspects, both about 40, flew from Moscow to London on Russian passports two days before the Skripals were poisoned on March 4. Basu said the passports were genuine but the men were probably using aliases, and appealed the public ""to come forward and tell us who they are.""

Sergei Skripal — a former Russian agent who had been convicted in his homeland of spying for Britain — and his daughter were found collapsed on a bench in the cathedral city of Salisbury, 90 miles (140 kilometers) southwest of London. They spent weeks hospitalized in critical condition and are now recovering in a secret location for their own protection.

British authorities and the international chemical weapons watchdog say the Skripals were exposed to Novichok, a type of military-grade nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

Britain blames the Russian government for the attack, a claim Moscow denies. The poisoning ignited a diplomatic confrontation in which hundreds of envoys were expelled by both Russia and Western nations.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the names and images of the suspects released by Britain ""say nothing to us.""

Zakharova called on Britain to cooperate with Russian law enforcement agencies on the investigation. She has criticized London for turning down Moscow's request to see the case files.

Basu would not say whether police believe the suspects worked for Russian security services but, he said, ""this was a sophisticated attack across borders.""

Police on Wednesday gave new details about what Basu called ""one of the most complex investigations"" the force had ever seen.

The police force released a series of images of the men as they traveled through London and Salisbury between March 2 and March 4. Police say the two men flew back to Moscow from Heathrow Airport on the evening of March 4, hours after the Skripals were found collapsed on a park bench in Salisbury.

Police believe the nerve agent used to poison the Skripals was smuggled to Britain in a counterfeit Nina Ricci perfume bottle and applied to the front door of Sergei Skripal's house.

More than three months later, the bottle was found by a local man, 48-year-old Charlie Rowley. He was hospitalized and his girlfriend Dawn Sturgess, 44, died after being exposed to the contents.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed Tuesday that Rowley and Sturgess were also exposed to Novichok.

Police are still trying to determine where the bottle was between the Skripal poisoning in March and its discovery by Rowley on June 27. As a result, Basu said, police are not yet ready to bring charges in the second poisoning.

"Jalaluddin Haqqani, an ex-U.S. ally who founded the militant Haqqani network in Afghanistan in the 1970s, has died after a long illness, the Taliban said, according to reports.

The Haqqani network is affiliated with both the Taliban and Al Qaeda and has been described as the top security threat in Afghanistan.

The elderly founder of Afghanistan's outlawed Haqqani network had been paralyzed for the past 10 years. The network was declared a terrorist organization by the United States in 2012.

Haqqani had not been heard from in several years, and reports of his death had been widespread in 2015. This is the first time the militant network has confirmed his death.

The BBC reported that in the 1980s, Haqqani was a major guerrilla leader against Soviet troops in Afghanistan and was considered a prized CIA asset. He later took sides with the Taliban in 1996, the report said.

Zabihullah Mujahed, a Taliban spokesman, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Tuesday that Haqqani died on Monday inside Afghanistan.

In announcing Haqqani's death Tuesday, the Taliban called him a religious scholar and exemplary warrior.

"Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro responded Friday to accusations by democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that he catcalled her in his debate challenge, arguing that she didn’t want to come across as being “afraid.”

In an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Trish Regan, Shapiro was asked for his thoughts on his debate offer being compared to ""catcalling"" by the House candidate.

While quipping that “catcalling must be very weird in Queens,” Shapiro accused people “on the left” of using a “defense in which anybody who requests a discussion or a debate must be evil by their very nature.”

“It’s catcalling because, I guess, if I suggest that I want to have a conversation, I’m demanding a response,” he said. “Well every request is a request. All she had to say here was, ‘Nah.’ That would’ve been fine, I mean she’s got that prerogative.”

BEN SHAPIRO, ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ SPAR AFTER HE OFFERS $10,000 TO DEBATE HER DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST BELIEFS

In a video posted Wednesday, in which Shapiro mocked Democratic National Committee chairperson Tom Perez for labeling the New York congressional candidate the “future of the Democratic Party,” he offered to donate $10,000 to her campaign if she accepted an offer to debate him.

“Miss Ocasio-Cortez, I’m really excited that you’ve been elevated to that position and I would love to have a real conversation with you about the issues. You’ve noted that you think Republicans are afraid to debate you or talk to you or discuss the issues with you,” Shapiro said.

“Not only am I eager to discuss the issues with you, I’m willing to offer $10,000 to your campaign, today, for you to come on our Sunday special,” he continued. “We can have an hour long conversation about all the topics under the sun, really probe your belief system.”

In a response on Twitter Thursday night, however, Ocasio-Cortez compared the debate request to “catcalling” and said she didn’t “owe a response to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions.”

""And also like catcalling, for some reason they feel entitled to one,"" she continued.

On Friday Shapiro said there was ""no question"" that Ocasio-Cortez was playing the ""victim card.""

“And the fact that she feels the necessity to go to this particular card, right, to play the ‘I’m a female and therefore I’m being victimized, this is like catcalling’ … the fact [that] she goes there instead of just saying ‘You know, I’m not interested in debate,’"" Shapiro continued, ""the reason she didn’t say the latter is because she didn’t want to look like she was afraid.”

ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ SHUNS HOLLYWOOD ELITS IN WEST COAST TOUR

He went on to say that he didn’t think there was “a lot of upside for her” to agree to the debate, saying she was unlikely to answer “questions well.”

“I mean, if she were to get into a discussion with somebody who asks her tough questions, I don’t think she has the information or the philosophy at her disposal to actually answer those questions well,” Shapiro said. “And she knows that, which is why her best move here would have been either to just ignore or to say no.

She was one of the more than 90,000 Koreans and their relatives in Japan who went to North Korea decades ago seeking what the country promised: ""paradise on earth.""

As North and South Korea make reconciliatory gestures and hundreds of war-separated relatives are reunited, Eiko Kawasaki and others like her feel forgotten.

Kawasaki, 76, who was born in Japan and lived for 43 years in North Korea before defecting, has not seen her children, still in North Korea, for years.

She and four other defectors filed a lawsuit against North Korea's government this week in Tokyo District Court, demanding 500 million yen, or about $5 million, in damages for human rights violations.

""Hardly anyone knows what happened,"" Kawasaki told The Associated Press on Friday in an interview at a Tokyo coffee shop. ""Everyone is stunned to hear it.""

Kawasaki is determined to keep telling her story to send the message Koreans living abroad must unite in a first step toward reunification.

Kawasaki was born in the ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto, the eldest daughter of a Korean laborer.

In the years before and during World War II, imperialist Japan colonized Korea and brought Koreans, many forcibly, to work in Japan. About 450,000 ethnic Koreans live in Japan, including third- and fourth-generation descendants of those laborers.

Kawasaki was 17 when she signed up for the repatriation program, which began in the 1950s and was backed by an aggressive campaign in Korean communities in Japan for people to take ships to go live in North Korea.

Although she exceled in school, her family was poor. All she wanted was to continue her education. North Korea promised a scholarship.

Like many others, she realized she had been duped as soon as she landed. The port was shabby, everyone was terribly thin, and children wore rags.

""You cannot express your opinion at all,"" she said, adding that everyone lived in fear, even of getting killed for saying the wrong thing. ""You can't get out of there.""

She became an engineer and married another engineer. He died, but they had five children, four of whom still live in North Korea. She defected in 2003, first to China and then to Japan in 2004, with the help of her younger brother.

Telling her story has been her life, going on a lecture circuit, including appealing to human rights organizations, and writing a book. She started her own group called Korea of All.

The lawsuit is her latest battle.

Kawasaki said she has great hopes for President Donald Trump's efforts on North Korea. She acknowledged she was a bit disappointed by his meeting with Kim Jong Un in June.

""I want him to stand firm,"" she said of Trump. ""Only America can solve this problem.""

"The stepmother of a 9-year-old girl in India was accused of ordering her son and three others to rape and kill the child, while in her presence, officials said.

The stepmother, who was not named, was allegedly upset that the girl was favored by her father, the BBC reported. The girl’s body was found in a jungle on Sunday in the Baramulla district.

Officials said the girl’s body was burned with acid and she may have been tortured. She was missing for 10 days before her body was found, police told the BBC.

"Turkish authorities on Monday responded to a drive-by shooting at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara amid increased tensions between the two countries over the detained American pastor, Reuters reported.

There were no injuries, but a window in a security cabin was reportedly hit. The shooting occurred at about 5 a.m. local time.

The report said the embassy was set to be closed this week for Eid al-Adha celebrations.

Private Ihlas news agency said four to five rounds were fired from a moving white car and targeted security booth outside Gate 6.

Earlier Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration rebuffed Turkey’s offer to release Pastor Andrew Brunson if the U.S. halted the investigation into Turkish bank Halkbank.

The Turkish government agreed to drop terrorism charges against the pastor in exchange of the U.S. government dropping fines totaling billions of dollars against the bank.

“A real NATO ally wouldn’t have arrested Brunson in the first place,” the official told the Journal.

"Saudi Arabia on Monday called the attempted missile attack on Riyadh’s main airport this weekend an ""act of war"" by Iran and vowed to retaliate.

Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have been fighting Saudi-backed forces there for several years, claimed responsibility for firing the ballistic missile on Saturday. The missile traveled more than 500 miles before Saudi Arabia intercepted it.

The official Saudi Press Agency charged that debris from the missile proved that it was made in Iran and smuggled into Yemen. American officials have previously alleged that Iran has armed the Houthi rebels.

The attempted missile strike was ""a blatant act of military aggression by the Iranian regime and could rise to be considered as an act of war,"" the Saudi Press Agency said in a statement.

Saudi Arabia “reserves its right to respond to Iran in the appropriate time and manner, in accordance with international law and based on the right of self-defense,"" the statement continued.

Speaking to CNN, Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir unambiguously asserted that Iran had effectively declared war.

""We see this as an act of war,"" he said. ""Iran cannot lob missiles at Saudi cities and towns and expect us not to take steps.""

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi called Saudi Arabia's claims ""false, irresponsible, destructive and provocative,"" according to the Iranian news agency Tasnim.

The dramatic escalation in tension between the two rival nations came just a day after dozens of princes, senior military officers, businessmen and top officials were arrested in a sweeping anti-corruption probe in Saudi Arabia.

"Protesters on Wednesday again disrupted Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill, as the nominee was grilled by senators over abortion, guns and whether a president should be investigated.

Moments after Chairman Chuck Grassley opened the hearing, shouting could be heard from the back of the room: “Sham president, sham justice!”

Kavanaugh, President Trump’s pick to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, appeared for his second day of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It’s the first day senators have to question Kavanaugh.

The interruptions from protesters that started a day earlier continued Wednesday, as Grassley dinged Democrats for wasting time a day earlier on “disruption and disorder over procedural matters.”

“Democratic senators interrupted the hearing 63 times before lunch and in the audience 70 people were arrested yesterday who were following their lead,” Grassley said.

Ironically, protesters continued to shout as Kavanaugh discussed how he tried to be respectful in court.

""I’ve tried to be a very collegial judge, I’ve tried to be civil,"" he said.

When the disruptions continued, Kavanaugh asked Grassley, “Should I proceed?”

Grassley told Kavanaugh to continue speaking, despite the outbursts.

“Let these people have their free speech and interrupt the other 300 million people listening,” the Iowa Republican said.

California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s ranking member and the first Democrat to grill the nominee, began her questioning of Kavanaugh by referencing the outbursts.

“I'm sorry about the circumstances, but we'll get through it,” she said.

Feinstein asked the nominee about his past case argument that Washington D.C.’s assault weapons ban was unconstitutional. He said he was following the precedent of the Supreme Court.

Kavanaugh, who grew up near Washington, replied that, “I fully understand the gang violence, gun violence, drug violence that plagues various cities, including Washington, D.C....but as a judge, my job as I saw it was to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court.""

Feinstein pressed Kavanaugh over the Roe v. Wade court decision regarding abortion.

“Well, as a general proposition, I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe versus Wade,” he said.

Feinstein also asked Kavanaugh about past comments regarding investigations involving a president. A staffer held up a sign with a 1999 law review quote from Kavanaugh that said, “If the president were the sole subject of an investigation, I would say no one should be investigating that.”

Kavanaugh said he’s never taken a position on the constitution on that question. He claimed those comments were about the “balance of a president fighting a war, leading a war, and a president subject to say ordinary civil lawsuits,” like former President Bill Clinton faced.

Kavanaugh, a former lawyer under President George W. Bush, vowed to serve as an independent judge.

“The first thing that makes a good judge is independence, not being swayed by political or public pressure,” Kavanaugh said, under questioning from Grassley. “That takes some backbone, that takes some judicial fortitude.”

Democrats on the panel, including a number thought to be considering a presidential run in 2020, Democrats, have sounded the alarm about Kavanaugh’s past work in Republican politics, including as a lawyer in George W. Bush’s White House.

On Wednesday, the Republicans and Democrats on the panel are being given 30 minutes each to ask Kavanaugh questions on live television.

“Look, this is the most powerful unelected position in the most powerful country in all human history. There’s no margin for error,” Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.” “We’ve got to be sure he’s the one.”

KAVANAUGH VOWS TO 'KEEP AN OPEN MIND IN EVERY CASE'

The questioning could go late into the evening Wednesday, and is set to continue through the week.

On Tuesday, protests from Democratic lawmakers and demonstrators delayed the formal start of proceedings by more than an hour. Within moments of Tuesday's confirmation hearing kickoff, top Democrats tried to sideline the session with a rapid-fire string of objections concerning access to the nominee's records.

The spectacle underscored the political nature of the confirmation hearings, coming two months before the midterms and as some senators gear up for a possible 2020 presidential run against President Trump. Several of those senators led the charge Tuesday in objecting to Kavanaugh.

The Capitol Police said they arrested 70 people on Tuesday.

Kavanaugh has left one of the longest paper trails of any recent Supreme Court nominee, having served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office in the George W. Bush administration.

Kavanaugh also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, another possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, on Tuesday acknowledged he already decided to vote against Kavanaugh’s confirmation. But he pleaded to delay the vote until more documents are released.

“We should not vote now,” Booker said. “We should wait. And if we're not waiting, we should object to your nomination.”

Democrats have specifically raised objections over how the Senate received 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents the night before the confirmation hearing began.

Republicans also argued Kavanaugh is highly qualified, saying Democrats aren’t making a case that he doesn’t have the experience to sit on the high court.

Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch.

The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee.

Republicans command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, which would return to 51-49 once a Republican successor to the late Sen. John McCain is seated. While the hearing was ongoing Tuesday, former Sen. Jon Kyl was named to that seat.

Republicans have little margin for error, though Vice President Pence can break a tie.

Republicans have said they hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

"The arrest of a 24-year-old illegal immigrant in the murder of University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts sparked both mournful — and fiery — responses from politicians on Tuesday, as they pleaded with Congress to do more to protect U.S. citizens.

Investigators identified Tibbetts' suspected killer as Cristhian Bahena Rivera, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who is believed to have been living in the area around Brooklyn, Iowa, for four to seven years.

President Trump, while in West Virginia speaking at a rally, said Tibbetts' murder ""should have never happened.""

""You heard about today with the illegal alien coming in, very sadly, from Mexico and you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman?"" Trump asked. ""Should have never happened. Illegally in our country.""

Vice President Mike Pence said he was ""heartbroken"" by the news of Tibbetts' brutal slaying and offered prayers for the young woman's family and close friends ""in this time of unimaginable grief."" Pence called for ""justice"" after police announced Rivera's arrest.

""We commend the swift action by local, state, & federal investigators working in Iowa in apprehending an illegal immigrant, who’s now charged with first-degree murder. Now, justice will be served. We will never forget Mollie Tibbetts,"" Pence continued in a tweet.

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she expressed condolences to Tibbetts' family earlier Tuesday, declaring ""justice had just begun"" after the arrest of Rivera.

""As Iowans, we are heartbroken, and we are angry. We are angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community, and we will do all we can bring justice to Mollie’s killer,"" Reynolds, a Republican, added in a tweet.

""My heart hurts for Mollie’s family. Prayers. 💗,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley tweeted after Tibbetts' dad, Rob, confirmed the student's body had been found.

MOLLIE TIBBETTS, UNIVERSITY OF IOWA STUDENT FOUND DEAD: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS

Fred Hubbell, a Democratic nominee for Iowa governor, tweeted that the news was ""truly heartbreaking,"" adding that ""words today will be of little comfort"" to Tibbetts' loved ones.

""This is truly heartbreaking. For Mollie’s parents, her family and friends, any words today will be of little comfort,"" he tweeted. ""As a parent and grandparent, your worst nightmare is losing your child.""

He went on to praise authorities for their ""around the clock"" dedication to the investigation.

John Cox, a GOP candidate in California's race for governor, released a statement comparing Tibbetts' murder to the ""heartbreaking death"" of Kate Steinle, who was shot and killed on a San Francisco pier in 2015. Investigators said the suspect, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, was in the U.S. illegally. A jury acquitted him of murder, manslaughter and assault last year but convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

""As a father of four daughters, it crushes my heart to see yet another family go through this nightmare,"" Cox said. ""Those who want to abolish ICE need to consider the consequences of their rash proposal.""

He continued, ""The Mollie Tibbetts case is one more tragic example of a senseless loss that never should have happened, similar to Kate Steinle’s heartbreaking death in San Francisco.""

Texas Governor Greg Abbott pivoted to turn Tibbetts' death into a poltical discussion, partially placing blame on sanctuary cities, though Iowa — where the 20-year-old's body was found in a field covered with corn stalks — doesn't have any designated sanctuary cities.

""An undocumented immigrant is charged for murder of Mollie Tibbetts, the Iowa college student who went missing on July 18,"" Abbott, a Republican, tweeted. ""This is why so many Americans are angry about sanctuary cities. It’s why Texas banned sanctuary cities.""

House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., also called on members of Congress, specifically Democrats, to help push forward stricter immigration legistlation.

MOLLIE TIBBETTS MURDER SUSPECT ID'D AS CRISTHIAN RIVERA, 24, LIVING IN US ILLECALLY

""What will it take for Democrats to renounce their dangerous open borders policies and start to put American citizens first?"" Scalise asked. ""It’s time they stop blocking common sense bills to restore the rule of law in this country before we see another senseless tragedy like this.""

In a nod to recent comments from fellow Republicans, Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar called on Congress to help secure the border.

""Securing our border is about protecting our communities, families and children from dangerous criminal activity and violence that threatens their safety. #SecureOurBorder,"" Gosar wrote, in part.

Iowa Rep. Steve King also asked for justice to be served.

""Mollie Tibbetts, our hearts are broken. We all prayed for your safe return. May you now be with the Lord and your family one day find a peace,"" he added.

"Imagine a scenario in which a top intelligence officer places the U.S. at risk all because he couldn't discern when the president was joking. It almost sounds like the plot for a comic strip.

Well, that's exactly what happened in the case of former CIA Director John Brennan, according to Scott Adams, creator of the popular “Dilbert” strip.

In a Twitter message Thursday, Adams slammed Brennan, asserting that the former CIA chief in 2016 didn't realize that President Trump was joking when the then-candidate urged Russia to find Hillary Clinton's missing emails.

“So Brennan may have started one of the most important political witch hunts in history based on not recognizing a joke — and I’m not even making that up,” Adams wrote.

“So Brennan may have started one of the most important political witch hunts in history based on not recognizing a joke — and I’m not even making that up.” - Scott Adams, creator of ""Dilbert.""

“I feel fairly confident in saying that what I just said is literally true: that the head of the CIA has almost destroyed the United States because he didn’t understand that an obvious joke was a joke.”

The comments came after Brennan lashed out at the White House for stripping him of his top security clearance Wednesday following a review of access granted to several top Obama-era intelligence and law enforcement officials.

The former CIA boss authored an explosive op-ed for the New York Times, saying that the president – by making the comment about Russia finding Clinton’s emails in July 2016 – encouraged and authorized his followers to collude with the Kremlin.

“The already challenging work of the American intelligence and law enforcement communities was made more difficult in late July 2016 … when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, publicly called upon Russia to find the missing emails of Mrs. Clinton,” Brennan wrote.

“By issuing such a statement, Mr. Trump was not only encouraging a foreign nation to collect intelligence against a United States citizen, but also openly authorizing his followers to work with our primary global adversary against his political opponent,” he added.

The Trump administration justified the decision to revoke the security clearance of Brennan, saying he “has a history that calls his credibility into question,” and accused him of “leveraging” the clearance to make “wild outbursts” and claims about the current administration.

“The president has a constitutional responsibility to protect classified information and who has access to it, and that’s what he’s doing is fulfilling that responsibility in this action,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday.

But the cartoonist said Brennan deserved to lose the security clearance for not being able to distinguish an obvious joke at the height of a political race, a mistake that eventually led to efforts to investigate the Trump campaign.

“Now, if you’ve got a guy who’s willing to put the entire stability at risk because he can’t tell the difference between a joke and a serious statement, then that guy has got to lose his security clearance at least,” Adams said.

“I wouldn’t want him anywhere near a decision. Would you? After seeing how Brennan responded to a public joke would you want him to make any important decisions about anything?

""I mean, that’s some scary stuff,” Adams wrote.",politics
"More than one million Americans decided to drop their health insurance plans last year, after policy changes dictated that about 20 percent of those with coverage through ObamaCare’s marketplace would no longer get government help paying for it.

2018’s available statistics show a slight increase of 3 percent in the number of ObamaCare enrollees, but Trump administration officials are sounding alarm bells.

“These reports show that the high-price plans on the individual market are unaffordable and forcing unsubsidized middle-class consumers to drop coverage,” Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma said about her agency’s new research.

These reports also represent a different reality than the one President Barack Obama had promised in explaining his signature legislation to the American people.

“If you like your health care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health care plan – period,” Obama said in 2009.

Democratic lawmakers have argued recently that pricier plans are a product of a Republican-led Congressional majority with backward priorities.

OBAMACARE'S FUTURE BECOMES BIG ISSUE IN MIDTERM ELECTIONS

“We’ve watched our GOP tax bill scam for the rich and rich Republican donors, wealthy shareholders and Wall Street reward big corporations, shipping American jobs overseas and driving up health care costs for hard-working Americans,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in June.

The most popular option on the ObamaCare marketplaces this year is the Silver Plan, which covers 63 percent of enrollees, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

There are at 13 states where premiums for those plans are already at least 40 percent higher this year than last year.

“We have lots of ranchers in Wyoming that had insurance that they could afford that worked for them,” Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said about his state, which has seen Silver premiums leap 65 percent. “But it was made illegal by the ObamaCare regulations that said no, no, no, it’s not good enough for the government.”

Experts lament that more expensive insurance plans don’t necessarily guarantee access to more qualified medical professionals.

“Even as the premiums have doubled and tripled, the quality of what you have has gone down,” John Goodman, president of the Goodman Institute. “Deductibles are now on average $4,000 and the networks are getting narrower and they exclude the best doctors and best hospitals.”",politics
"Lawmakers in California on Monday sent three bills to Gov. Jerry Brown’s desk that call for stricter restrictions on firearms in a state that has one of the toughest gun laws in the country.

The bill was sent to Brown’s desk one day after a gunman opened fire at a gaming event in Florida, killing two before turning the gun on himself.

The Los Angeles Times reported that the bills call for a lifetime ban for those convicted of domestic violence along with those ordered by a court to a psychiatric hold twice in one year.

State lawmakers have also called for Californians interested in obtaining a concealed weapon permit to undergo eight hours of instruction and pass a live-fire test before being granted the permit, the report said.

Most Republicans opposed the concealed-carry measure, warning that there is no limit on the amount of training a county can demand for the permit under the proposed law.

The state is known to have tight gun laws. Those convicted of domestic violence in the state currently face a 10-year probation, the report said. The state also currently enforces a five-year ban for those ordered by a court into a psychiatric holds, the report said.

"U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, grilled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Wednesday over a 1990s article he wrote, questioning whether Native Hawaiians should be treated as indigenous people.

Hirono, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will rule on Kavanaugh's nomination to the nation's highest court by President Trump, also posed questions to the nominee regarding sexual harassment, resulting in more tense moments.

Kavanaugh, who faced a second day of chaotic questioning on Capitol Hill, was asked by Hirono whether he has ever been accused of sexual misconduct or entered a settlement agreement with anyone over such allegations.

The high court nominee answered no to both questions, but Hirono continued her questioning over the issue, drawing attention to Kavanaugh’s relationship with Alex Kozinski, a former judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals who was forced to retire in the wake of accusations of sexual impropriety with multiple law clerks.

“I started asking these questions about sexual harassment because it's so hard to hold lifetime appointees to the federal bench accountable and because I did not want the #MeToo movement to be swept under the rug,” the senator said.

Hirono pressed Kavanaugh on whether he was aware of the “egregious and pervasive” accusations of sexual misconduct against Kozinski, as he was a clerk for the judge in the 1990s and was introduced by him to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2006 when then-President George W. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the federal bench, according to Honolulu Civil Beat.

Kavanaugh replied by saying he wasn’t aware of the allegations at the time and that he had “no reason not to” believe the women who made the allegations against the former judge. He added that if he had heard of any allegations about another judge, he would have reported them to the appropriate authorities.

But Hirono, 70, who has served in the Senate since January 2013, seem dissatisfied with Kavanaugh’s answers.

“You saw nothing, you heard nothing and you obviously said nothing,” she said, suggesting the allegations against Kozinski were an open secret.

Kavanaugh said he agreed with the senator that there needs to be a change in the culture so that people coming forward with allegations of sexual misconduct receive the supprt they deserve.

“I agree with you, Senator,” Kavanaugh said. “There needs to be better reporting mechanisms.”

But concerns about sexual harassment were just a short episode in Hirono's 30-minute questioning. The senator was primarily focused on an op-ed article that Kavanaugh wrote in 1999 for the Wall Street Journal.

In that article, Kavanaugh debated whether the U.S. government should treat Native Hawaiians as indigenous people because they had come from Polynesia. The article was about a 1996 Supreme Court case, Rice v. Cayetano, in which the high court ultimately ruled that the state could not let only Native Hawaiians vote in elections for the Board of Trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.

Hirono slammed Kavanaugh over the article, with her staffers holding a map showing that Hawaii has always been part of Polynesia.

“In the piece you wrote, the Native Hawaiian community was not indigenous because, as you say, after all, they came from Polynesia. It might interest you to know that Hawaii is part of Polynesia so it's not that they came from Polynesia, they were a part of Polynesia,” the senator said.

“You also implied that Native Hawaiians couldn't qualify as an Indian tribe and therefore were not entitled to constitutional protections given to indigenous Americans,” she added. “It is hard to believe you spent any time researching the history of Native Hawaiians.”

Hirono went on to ask Kavanaugh whether he believes the legitimacy of programs aimed at helping Native Hawaiians should be more scrutinized given his views on the issue.

“As I sit here today as a judge, I would listen to arguments 16 years ago ... but if I were a judge, I would listen to the arguments to your question, Congress has substantial power with respect to programs like this. I appreciate what you've said about Native Hawaiians,” Kavanaugh said.

“I think Congress has substantial power of course in this area that you're discussing and I would want to hear more about how Rice applies. I would want to hear the arguments on both sides. I would keep an open mind and appreciate your perspective on this question,” he added.

The senator finished the line of questioning, saying “I think you have a problem here” and drew attention to Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a potential swing vote in the confirmation of the high court nominee.

“Your view is that Hawaiians don't deserve protections as indigenous people under the constitution and your argument raises a serious question on how you would vote on the constitutionality of programs benefiting Alaska natives,” Hirono said. “I think that my colleagues from Alaska should be deeply troubled by your views.”

North Korea marked the anniversary of the end of World War II and its liberation from Japanese colonial rule with a series of ceremonies ahead of what is expected to be a much bigger event next month — the 70th anniversary of its national foundation day.

The celebrations Wednesday were decidedly low-key.

A group of war veterans from the former Soviet Union participated, and thousands of people cheered their team to victory over a South Korean squad in the opening match of an under-15 youth tournament in Pyongyang featuring players from several countries. People also streamed to statues of the country's leaders or other monuments to observe the anniversary, as is customary.

North Korea's big party is expected next month. It has been preparing an extravagant celebration complete with parades, foreign VIP delegations and mass gymnastics on its Sept. 9 foundation day.

The September festivities in the North are intended to be spectacular homage to Kim's campaign to bolster his country's image abroad and ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula through diplomacy with its neighbors and the United States.

But after a surprisingly successful start, the diplomacy appear to be faltering somewhat, with negotiations on Washington's demands for the North to abandon its nuclear weapons bogging down after what were seen by many as overly optimistic public statements after Kim's summit with President Donald Trump in Singapore two months ago.

Pyongyang claims Washington must first make a stronger effort to build confidence and assure its security before denuclearization can occur.

North Korea recently accused the United States of trying to force other countries to strengthen their sanctions enforcement and to block high-level delegations from attending the September events.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who is to visit Pyongyang in September for his third summit with leader Kim Jong Un, gave a speech in Seoul to mark the anniversary and said the upcoming summit would mark a ""bold step"" toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and a formal declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War.

Moon also talked about potential joint economic projects between the Koreas, but said that could only happen as an outcome of a complete denuclearization of the peninsula. He mentioned the resumption of joint tours to North Korea's scenic Diamond Mountain resort, restarting operations at a joint factory park in North Korea's Kaesong and also potential projects surrounding inter-Korean railways and development of North Korea's natural resources.

Kim's diplomacy with Beijing, and with Moscow as well, seems to be progressing more smoothly. Chinese tourism is reportedly already on the rise and there are signs that Chinese businessmen are looking to resume and even broaden their activities in the country as soon as the political climate will allow them to do so.

That's crucial to Kim, who is hoping to undermine support for the U.S.-backed sanctions so that he can focus on improving North Korea's economy",world

Hotels, big and small. Tourists from all over the country, maybe the world. ""As long as we have the leadership of our respected Marshal,"" he says, referring to leader Kim Jong Un, ""our future will be bright indeed.""

So wouldn't think of questioning the leader, but there is a hint of apprehension in his voice. And he isn't alone.

North Korea is pushing ahead with a new strategy of economic development and the intensified diplomacy with China, South Korea and the United States that such a move requires. But hopes for a better future are mixed with concern over potential downsides of political or social volatility, and something that's harder to articulate: a fear of the unknown — even if it appears far more promising than the arduous path the country has been on for decades.

Even before announcing in January that he had sufficiently perfected his nuclear arsenal and could start to focus on other things, Kim has held economic development to be his primary long-term concern.

He has allowed markets and entrepreneurialism to flourish and, since succeeding his father as leader seven years ago, has dramatically transformed the skyline of the capital, Pyongyang, with several high-rise districts. The transformation in the east coast city of Wonsan, where Kim has a summer villa, has been almost as spectacular.

As Kim prepares for the 70th anniversary of North Korea's founding on Sept. 9, his ambitious development plan is being implemented, from the small-time renovation of town halls to the almost biblical-scale mobilization of ""soldier-builders,"" who are working around the clock to turn the remote northern city of Samjiyon into yet another showcase of Pyongyang-style socialism.

Economic development — and how U.S. capital and know-how could speed it along — was President Donald Trump's big carrot when he met with Kim in Singapore three months ago to try to negotiate a denuclearization deal.

But Kim's diplomatic overtures aren't intended to open the door to American capitalists, a scenario that would make any good party cadre shudder. They are aimed at breaking down support for sanctions and getting the U.S. to step out of the way. Kim's game is to play China and the U.S. off each other, grab whatever concessions he can along the way and adjust his position as the situation evolves.

In the meantime, lest anyone get the wrong idea, the ruling Workers' Party of Korea has begun churning out paeans to socialism in its daily newspaper along with anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism screeds that underscore North Korea's official opposition to essentially anything that might be considered the American way of life. Or, as it's known in the jargon of North Korea's propaganda machine, ""the imperialists' bourgeois ideological and cultural poisoning.""

The past few months have been tense in Pyongyang.

Restrictions on some of the movements of foreign diplomats have been tightened, for example, and even requests by The Associated Press to interview government officials or to speak with regular citizens have mostly been denied.

Uncertain of where it might all end up, state-run media have provided only limited coverage of Kim's meetings with Trump in June and his multiple summits with Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Reports have portrayed Kim as the consummate statesman, firmly in charge of a carefully considered strategy to make his country safer and more prosperous.

Kim is ardently wooing South Korean investment to help him build the very things Trump was offering: infrastructure, particularly roads and railways, and the development of selected tourism zones. After a high-profile chill last year, he is also actively courting Beijing, which continues to be an essential source of fuel, a key market for North Korea's coal and other natural resources and a fairly reliable check on U.S. power in the region.

Pyongyang's explanation for the shift in its foreign policy has been consistent: having successfully built a credible nuclear deterrent to U.S. aggression, Kim is reaching out to Seoul to join hands in a ""for Koreans, by Koreans"" effort to secure a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, unhindered by the meddling of foreign powers.

Undoubtedly, images of the leader smiling and shaking hands with Trump, whose face had never been on the front pages of their newspapers before, signaled a major and bewildering change to many North Koreans.

But officials have made sure they don't have much time to ruminate on it.

Normal routines of work and study have been put on hold for large segments of the populace who have been mobilized for the development projects. Tens of thousands of people in Pyongyang, meanwhile, have spent the past several months feverishly preparing for mass rallies and mass games to mark the anniversary.

Mount Chilbo, a collection of rocky peaks and a stretch of largely untouched seashore on the country's northeastern fringe, is one of North Korea's most cherished natural wonders.

The first hotel for non-Korean visitors opened in the 1980s, followed in 2004 by homestay-style lodgings near the beach, said So, a North Hamgyong Province People's Committee official. Together they have a capacity of fewer than 100 guests and only operate from April until early November.

Many North Koreans bring tents and sleep on the beach.

But even in this rustic corner of the country, the pressure to contribute to Kim's grand development scheme is keenly felt.

So said he would soon travel to China to discuss possible areas of cooperation.

As an indicator of Kim's success with Beijing, tourism from China is already on the rise. Pyongyang's longer-term goal, however, is to tap the South Korean market. The idea is that, if handled properly, South Korean tourism would present a chance to promote the North in a positive light and boost its image within South Korea.

That's a gamble too.

Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, South Koreans were allowed to visit in a highly regulated and controlled manner, and massive investment from South Korean businesses helped the North fund infrastructure projects in the same Wonsan-Mount Kumgang area that Kim is focusing on now. But it ended badly in 2008 when a South Korean woman who entered a restricted area was shot to death by a North Korean soldier.

So said he believes Chilbo, like Kim's pet projects in Wonsan, could be a big draw for tourists. But he worries about where the money will come from and what might be lost.

""Whatever we do, we need to protect the natural beauty of this place,"" he said. ""I think there will be many changes in the coming years. Plans are being discussed. But nothing is decided.""

"The federal jury that found former Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort guilty of eight counts of tax evasion and bank fraud Tuesday reached the appropriate verdict, based on convincing evidence assembled by prosecutors working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

A mistrial was declared on 10 other counts when jurors couldn’t agree on verdicts on those charges.

The eight guilty verdicts will give Mueller’s team investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign needed momentum. Mueller did not seem to be making much progress of late. He can now count Manafort’s conviction as a major victory – along with a guilty plea he elicited earlier from President Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.

Yet Manafort’s trial and conviction in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, reveal nothing of substance about allegations that the Russian government worked with Donald Trump and his presidential campaign in 2016 to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House.

Mueller’s office was created to investigate this alleged conspiracy – referred to as “collusion” by President Trump, who states almost daily that “there was no collusion.”

But as Mueller’s investigation widened based on new information that prosecutors and FBI agents picked up, evidence emerged about Manafort’s business activities going back to 2006 – years before he joined the Trump campaign for five months in 2016.

According to prosecutors, Manafort was paid $60 million from Ukraine’s then-President Viktor Yanukovich and his political allies. After stashing the money away in offshore bank accounts without paying taxes, Manafort secretly moved at least $15 million into the United States to fund a lavish lifestyle, prosecutors told jurors.

So none of Manafort’s activities that he stood trial for had anything to do with Trump, or even American presidential politics. They instead centered on the squalid efforts of influence-peddler Manafort to hide payments from Ukrainian politicians.

Manafort’s political consulting, such as it was, did not violate federal law. Only his efforts to hide his income from the Internal Revenue Service were at issue. The bottom line: the case against him was about whether he cheated on his taxes – not about Russian election interference.

The specific nature of the charges against Manafort reveals their limits. Trump went virtually unmentioned in the trial. Prosecutors did not raise Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 elections.

While Mueller may have targeted Manafort for prosecution in the hopes that he would cooperate to reveal alleged criminal activity by Trump, that issue went unaddressed at the Manafort trial.

Even if Manafort’s financial misdeeds had rendered him vulnerable to blackmail from Ukrainians or Russians, the charges of tax evasion did not allow that potential link to 2016 election meddling to arise.

Documents alone confirmed Manafort’s guilt. The political consultant did not testify or even provide an affirmative defense.

Manafort’s lawyers focused their strategy on attacking the prosecution’s star witness and Manafort’s former right-hand man – Rick Gates. After Gates testified against Manafort and accused him of breaking the law, Manafort’s lawyers claimed that Gates stole from Manafort to fund his own expensive luxuries and said Manafort was a victim.

It was as if Batman and Robin turned on each other, each saying his partner had embarked on a life of crime.

After four days of deliberations, the jury agreed with prosecutors on much of their case, despite their inability to agree whether Manafort was guilty or innocent on 10 of the 18 charges against him.

Perhaps just as important as the verdict is what it means for the future of the Mueller investigation.

U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III could well sentence Manafort to spend the rest of his life in prison. That prospect gives Manafort a strong incentive to cooperate with Mueller, in the hopes of receiving a lighter sentence.

Manafort may know of communications between the Trump campaign and Russians over the theft and release of the Clinton campaign’s emails in 2016 or other matters. If Manafort now starts cooperating with Mueller, Mueller may have just gained some powerful ammunition in his ongoing investigation of the Trump campaign.

On the other hand, Manafort may know nothing because there is nothing to the collusion charges. In that case, Manafort may be trying to show his loyalty to President Trump in order to win a presidential pardon.

President Trump may have given Manafort reason to hope for a pardon with his frequent attacks on the Mueller investigation, which he regularly calls “a rigged witch hunt.”

But if President Trump believes that Mueller’s investigation has gone too far, he should not resort to the pardon power to cure it.

Manafort was plainly guilty of tax evasion, on a large scale – TurboTax did not just make a $15 million error on his 1040.

Instead, President Trump can stop prosecutorial abuse either by ordering Mueller to curb his investigation or even firing the special counsel and replacing him. But a pardon of Manafort would seem purely political, in contrast earlier pardons granted by Trump to defendants who had arguably been sentenced to punishments wholly out of proportion to their alleged wrongdoing.

While the Constitution places few limits on presidential pardons, President Trump should not use a valuable tool of executive power to protect a political crony.

Mueller’s victory in convicting Manafort may also place more pressure on other figures in the Russia investigation. Any threats that the special counsel may make to win their cooperation will have now have renewed credibility.

And Manafort faces another trial in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia in September on additional charges brought by Mueller. A conviction in that case would put still more pressure on Manafort to cooperate with Mueller’s investigation and turn on the president.",politics
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has been floated as a possible 2020 Democratic presidential pick, was forced to backtrack this week after saying America “was never that great” -- the latest example of top Democrats criticizing what they see as the country’s injustices.

But now Republicans are saying that it represents part of a broader theme for top Democrats, saying that they are united in their ""collective bashing of America.""



Cuomo shocked supporters, and sparked a national controversy when he said at a bill signing: “We’re not going to make America great again, it was never that great.”



“We have not reached greatness, we will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged, we will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51 percent of our population, is gone,” he went on to add.



Cuomo was criticized for the remark on both sides of the political spectrum. On the left, gubernatorial challenger Cynthia Nixon told NY1 it was “another example of Andrew Cuomo trying to figure out what a progressive sounds like and missing by a mile.”

GOV. ANDREW CUOMO'S INCREDIBLE STATEMENT DISSING AMERICA SHOWS BANKRUPTCY OF DEMOCRATIC IDEAS

President Trump meanwhile, tore into his long-standing rival in a series of tweets in recent days. He called it “a career threatening statement” from Cuomo and predicted that “his political career is over.”



Cuomo has been walking back the statement. His office released a statement saying that he does, in fact, believe that America is great, but that it has yet to reach its full potential. Meanwhile on Friday in a call with reporters, he said the remark was “inartful.""



“Of course America is great and of course America has always been great. No one questions that,” he said.



But the remark is the latest in a series of bolder statements from Democrats in calling out what they see as injustices or inequalities in America.



It’s also something that Republicans are keen to exploit, believing that while such statements may play well with left-wing activists, it will be rejected by the nation at large.



In an email blast this week, The Republican National Committee said that “the only thing that seems to unify prominent Democrats these days is their collective bashing of America.”



Trump suggested Cuomo’s remark was an extension of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s famous statement that half of Trump supporters could be put into “a basket of deplorables.”

“Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic -- you name it,” she said.

That remark was widely perceived to have hurt her campaign, and many Trump supporters now wear the “deplorable” tag as a badge of honor.

Last week she was criticized for supporting an 11-year-old student who refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.

""Keep up the good work Mariana,"" she tweeted.

But the RNC pointed to other remarks from other possible 2020 candidates who appeared to take a swing at America, or large numbers of people in it.

Earlier this month Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., told an audience in New Orleans that things are “savagely wrong” in America and that there is a “normalcy of injustice.”

CORY BOOKER SAYS HE'S CRIED 'TEARS OF RAGE' OVER TRUMP RHETORIC, CLAIMS SOMETHING 'SAVAGELY WRONG' WITH US

“I’m a big believer that if America, if this country hasn’t broken your heart, then you don’t love her enough. Because there’s things that are savagely wrong in this country. There’s a normalcy of injustice that we’ve accepted,” he said.

Also this month, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who ran against Clinton in the Democratic primary, said that there was something “fundamentally immoral” about America due to its economic inequality.

“I think that there is an understanding there is something fundamentally immoral and wrong about a nation in which we have three people who own more wealth than the bottom half of the American people. That does not make sense,” Sanders said in an appearance on CBS.

Meanwhile Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., came under fire from police groups when she described America’s criminal justice system as racist “front to back.”

“The hard truth about our criminal justice system: It’s racist ... front to back.” she said before a college audience.

POLICE, SESSIONS SLAM WARREN FOR CALLING CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 'RACIST'

The GOP said that the remarks show that Democrats are out of touch, and it would appear to be an issue where there isn’t much support from the public. A 2016 Washington Post poll found that only seven percent of those polled said that America has never been great.

"A Michigan state Democrat apologized Thursday after calling her opponent and the rival's campaign staff “ching-chongs” – in reference to the candidate’s Asian heritage.

State Rep. Bettie Cook Scott has come under fire after she hurled anti-Asian slurs at state Rep. Stephanie Chang during the primary election last week, the Detroit Metro Times reported.

Scott reportedly referred to her opponent as “ching-chang” and ""ching-chong"" to voters outside polling precincts. She also allegedly made other offensive comments, including telling one of Chang's campaign volunteers “You don’t belong here” and “I want you out of my country.”

In addition, Sean Gray, Chang’s African-American husband, said Scott scolded him for marrying Chang.

Scott also reportedly told a voter that immigrants from China were “coming over and taking our community from us” and that it “disgusts” her to see “black people holding signs for these Asians and not supporting their own people.”

Chang and Scott were running against each other in the Democratic Party primary for Michigan's 1st Senate District. Chang won the primary with nearly 50 percent of the vote.

“These comments are offensive to all Asian-Americans,” Chang told Metro Times. “It isn't about me. It's about an elected official disrespecting entire populations, whether they be Asian-American, immigrant, or residents of Sen. District 1 or [Cook's] own current House district.”

""I humbly apologize to Rep. Chang and to her husband, Mr. Gray, and to the broader Asian American community."" - Michigan state Rep. Bettie Cook Scott

“We expect better from anyone who wants to call themselves a Michigan Democrat,” the party’s chairman Brandon Dillon said in a statement. “Bettie Cook Scott needs to apologize to the entire Asian-American community. If an individual doesn’t share our fundamental values of tolerance, decency, and respect, they should find another party.”

Following the criticism, Scott released a statement apologizing for the remarks.

“Those are not the kinds of comments that should be made nor are they the kind of comments I would normally make,” Scott said, according to the Detroit News. “I humbly apologize to Rep. Chang and to her husband, Mr. Gray, and to the broader Asian-American community.”

“We live in a time of increasing divisiveness,” she added. “As a state representative, I should never do anything to contribute to an atmosphere of divisiveness and for that, I am terribly sorry. I look forward to meeting with Rep. Chang to express my apologies directly to her as soon as she’s able to meet with me.”",politics
"A liberal millionaire now running for Congress in Pennsylvania -- and railing against the influence of money in politics -- has a history of making large donations to former President Barack Obama's campaign and other efforts.

Scott Wallace, grandson of a former vice president of Franklin Roosevelt -- who’s running as a Democrat in Pennsylvania's 1st Congressional District against Republican incumbent Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick -- gave more than $100,000 to Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and Presidential Inaugural Committee and also asked top administration official John Podesta to appoint him as U.S. Ambassador in South Africa.

Wallace has made criticism of money in politics a campaign issue, saying money “corrupts” politics and slamming President Trump for giving access to wealthy donors.

In July 2008, both Wallace and his wife Christy donated $30,800 and $28,500 respectively to the Obama Victory Fund, the former president's political action commmittee, Federal Election Commission records show.

Also in 2008, Wallace gave Obama’s Presidential Inaugural Committee $50,000 – the maximum permitted contribution, which provided Wallace with tickets to Obama's January 2009 swearing-in ceremony, parade and inaugural balls.

As he was donating to various Obama funds, Wallace also began his efforts to become the U.S. ambassador to South Africa, his so-called “second country,” where he lived for several years while overseeing the Wallace Global Fund’s projects in the country, by directly pushing a top Obama official to consider him for the role.

""It has become my second country, and I would be deeply honored to be considered to represent President Obama as ambassador there."" - Scott Wallace

“I know you must have a million things on your plate, but as I mentioned to you, Elizabeth and Smith Bagley were encouraging me to reach out to you sooner rather than later about a possible appointment in an Obama administration,” Wallace wrote to Podesta on Nov 3, 2008, according to an email released by WikiLeaks.

“I am passionate about helping South Africa achieve its full promise, and see its upcoming elections and the next couple of years as critical to the health of its democracy. It has become my second country, and I would be deeply honored to be considered to represent President Obama as ambassador there,” he continued, openly offering his diplomatic services.

“I imagine that my service under Republicans in the Senate, as well as subsequent decades of working with Democratic Judiciary Committee leadership, should be of some help with Senate confirmation,” he added.

""I took the liberty of listing you as a reference in the application forms at change.gov, but then wondered if perhaps those need to be names outside the formal transition process."" - Scott Wallace

The liberal millionaire returned to the issue a few weeks later, sending another email to Podesta, who spearheaded Obama’s transition team, saying he listed Podesta as a reference in an application to work in the administration.

“John, I meant to ask you this at the Democracy Alliance conference, but had to duck out just before the end of your session … I took the liberty of listing you as a reference in the application forms at change.gov, but then wondered if perhaps those need to be names outside the formal transition process,” he wrote.

“John, let me also offer my assistance to the personnel team in a range of areas. From my 13 years as a grantmaker, and about 20 years in the field of criminal justice policy and research, my job is generally to identify and invest in the highest quality leaders of the most effective organizations,” Wallace wrote in a follow up email.

""Money corrupts politics and it corrupts it absolutely."" - Scott Wallace

TOP DEM HOUSE HOPEFUL FUNDED GITMO DETAINEES’ LEGAL HELP ‘JUST AFTER 9/11’

That history appears to contradict Wallace’s more recent statements about his views on the influence of money in politics.

“Money corrupts politics and it corrupts it absolutely,” Wallace said earlier this year at the Bucks County (Pa.) Democratic Forum.

He also criticized President Trump for giving access to wealthy donors.

“But when his buddies in Congress, like Paul Ryan and Brian Fitzpatrick, finally OK’d his massive tax cuts for corporations and billionaires, what did Trump do? Jetted to his Florida country club and bragged to a roomful of people who paid $200,000 to get in the door, that they all ‘just got a lot richer.’ Oooh, that’s rich,” Wallace said in a March news release.

Even in 2011, Wallace decried contributions from “wealthy elites” and suggested the U.S. political system was being ruined by such donors.

“Sacrifice is expected, improving your own lifestyle is not. This is not to say that American politics today is not awash in big money. Our political parties and politicians are massively dependent on contributions from corporations and wealthy elites,” he wrote in an op-ed for South Africa's Cape Times.

The Wallace campaign didn’t respond to Fox News’ request for a comment.",politics
"The State Department is pushing back against a news report saying the Trump administration has ramped up efforts to deny passports to Hispanics who have U.S. citizenship but are suspected of possibly having fraudulent birth certificates.

In a statement to Fox News on Thursday, a State Department spokeswoman blasted the Washington Post over the story, saying passport denials in these cases are actually at a six-year low after peaking in 2015 during the Obama administration.

“The facts don’t back up the Washington Post’s reporting. This is an irresponsible attempt to create division and stoke fear among American citizens while attempting to inflame tensions over immigration,” said Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman. “Under the Trump Administration, domestic passport denials for so called ‘midwife cases’ are at a 6-year low. The reporting is a political cheap shot.”

According the Post, both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations denied passports to people delivered by midwives in Texas’s Rio Grande Valley. The government has long believed fraudulent U.S. birth certificates have been given to babies along the border who were actually born in Mexico.

The newspaper reported the government, though, settled a case with the American Civil Liberties Union in 2009. The Post said that largely stopped the passport denials until the Trump administration took over.

The Washington Post in its story cited several examples of people who said they're being wrongly targeted as the Trump administration challenges people they believe may have fraudulent birth certificates.

The Post cited several examples, including a 40-year-old named Juan who reportedly says he was born in the United States, was delivered by a midwife in southern Texas and served in the Army, the Border Patrol and the state prison system.

“I served my country. I fought for my country,” the man said.

Juan told the newspaper he attempted to renew his U.S. passport this year but the State Department sent him a letter doubting his birth certificate is real.

The Post said Juan is one of “hundreds, and possibly thousands” of Hispanics along the border who have been accused by the Trump administration of having fraudulent birth certificates since they were babies.

But the State Department, in response, provided a chart to Fox News detailing passport denials since 2013 of people on the southern border suspected of possibly having a fraudulent birth document. According to the chart, fewer people had their passports denied in 2017 and 2018 so far, under Trump, than in the final years of the Obama administration.

The State Department had told the Washington Post they sometimes ask people suspected of having fraudulent papers to provide additional proof of birth. Those flagged are applicants who have birth certificates filed by a “midwife or other birth attendant suspected of having engaged in fraudulent activities” or those with both a U.S. and foreign birth certificate.

“Individuals who are unable to demonstrate that they were born in the United States are denied issuance of a passport,” the State Department said.

The newspaper also spotlighted the case of a 35-year-old Texas man who said he was born in the United States but detained after attempting to re-enter the U.S. after a trip to Mexico in 2017.

Agents, the man said, asked him if he was born in Mexico. When he refused to say so, he was sent a detention center and entered into deportation proceedings. He was eventually released but the man said his passport was revoked.

The Washington Post story provoked an avalanche of criticism directed at the Trump administration.

“This administration’s anti-immigrant, nationalistic rhetoric and policies are now targeting U.S. citizens, in an attempt to deny them of the rights that our Constitution guarantees,” the Congressional Hispanic Caucus tweeted. “This is wrong, shameless and betrays our most sacred American ideals.”

Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement the organization is investigating and “exploring possible legal steps.”

“The Trump administration’s attempt to deny passports to long-term American residents living in border areas is just one more inhumane act in a series of unlawful actions,” Gelernt said.",politics
"Democratic congressional candidates are revolting against Nancy Pelosi in even bigger numbers, amid fears that her grip on power could hurt the party's chances in the midterms and hold back its next generation of leaders.

The list of candidates refusing to support the California Democrat for speaker -- or refusing to state their position -- has steadily grown, though estimates vary.

The Washington Post counts at least 27 Democratic House candidates who won't commit support.

Another count published by NBC News says over 50 Democratic candidates and incumbents would not support Pelosi for speaker —should the party take back the 23-seat majority from Republicans.

Rashida Tlaib, who just won a House Democratic primary in Michigan, was the latest to come out against Pelosi for speaker.

“Probably not. That’s my answer, no. Probably not,” Tlaib said on CNN’s “New Day” Thursday when asked if she would support Pelosi in a vote for speaker. “For me, I need someone that, again, is connected with the different levels of poverty going on, the fact that there are structures and barriers for working families in my district that need to be dismantled, and supporting big banks and supporting efforts that I don’t think put the people first is troubling.”

Tlaib said constituents in the district she hopes to represent—the Detroit metro area—don’t feel like they are “being heard” in Washington.

“I think that starts at the top with leadership,” Tlaib said.

Pelosi's prominence, meanwhile, has served as a political weapon for Republicans, as it has across numerous election cycles.

President Trump repeatedly sought to tie Pelosi to Ohio Democratic congressional candidate Danny O’Connor in this week's special House election.

Though the race has not been officially called, Republican Troy Balderson has claimed victory in that close contest.

The National Republican Congressional Committee has put out an ad campaign tying many Democratic candidates to Pelosi and her policies.

“Democrats cannot escape the Nancy Pelosi leadership conundrum. Her potential return to the speakership should be a rallying cry for every Republican to get out and vote in November,” Republican National Committee spokesman Steve Guest told Fox News in a statement Friday. “Her number one priority would be to reverse the great American comeback ushered in by President Trump and Congressional Republicans.”

The Pelosi question also has led to some awkward TV moments for Democratic candidates.

Before this week's election, O'Connor was pressed by MSNBC’s Chris Matthews on whether he would vote for Pelosi as speaker if he were elected to the House.

“We need new leadership on both sides, the old ways aren’t working,” O’Connor said repeatedly. But when pressed on what he would do if Democrats absolutely needed him to vote for Pelosi to stop Republicans from keeping the speaker’s gavel, he admitted he'd support “whoever the Democrats put forward.” He later reiterated that he would not support Pelosi.

Meanwhile, liberal darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who beat Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., in her primary, stumbled when asked whether she considers Pelosi the leader of the House Democrats.

“Of course. I think, absolutely, right now you know, she is the leader of ... I mean, um speaker, rather leader Pelosi hopefully, you know, we’ll see,” Ocasio-Cortez said on CNN’s “Cuomo Primetime.” “She’s, she’s the current leader of the party and I think that the party absolutely does have its leadership in the House, we have our leadership in the Senate as well.”

Struggling to smooth her answer, Ocasio-Cortez said it was too soon to “get ahead of ourselves.”

“I've got to win my race first,” she said. “We've got to look at winning the House back in November and then once the House is won, we have to make that decision from there.”

Incumbent Democrats rallying against Pelosi include Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., Rep Linda Sanchez (from Pelosi’s home state of California), Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., and newly elected Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., among others.

Pelosi, though, has downplayed the pushback and the attack ads against her, and is focusing on taking back the majority.

“Leader Pelosi has always enjoyed the overwhelming support of House Democrats and that will continue into the majority she’s so focused on winning,” Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill told Fox News in an email Friday.

Hammill also noted that Pelosi has not, at this point, asked anyone for support for her speaker candidacy.

Last month, Pelosi claimed that some the calls for her to relinquish power in the Democratic Party were sexist. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Pelosi was asked whether she had ever been “tempted to step away” from her current post as House minority leader.

Pelosi suggested a double standard was at play, compared with men in leadership positions.

“I think some of it is a little bit on the sexist side—although I wouldn’t normally say that,” Pelosi said in the interview. “Except it’s like, really? Has anyone asked whatshisname, the one who’s the head of the Senate?”

Pelosi seemed to momentarily forget Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConell’s, R-Ky., name, and was reminded by an aide during the interview.

“McConnell,” she corrected. “I mean he’s got the lowest numbers of anybody in the world. Have you ever gone up to him and said, ‘How much longer do you think you’ll stay in this job?’… Nobody ever went up to Harry Reid and said that. Nobody ever says that to anybody except a woman.

"The liberal media suggest that President Trump is on a sinking ship and will be soon be losing the support of a large number of his followers – the group Hillary Clinton dismissively described as “a basket full of deplorables.” Don’t believe it.

The conviction Tuesday of former Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort on tax and bank fraud charges – and the guilty plea that Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen entered the same day to charges of violating federal campaign finance laws, tax evasion and making a false statement to a bank – won’t shake support for Trump among the millions of Americans who voted for him and appreciate his many accomplishments in office.

Here’s why:

Supporters of President Trump are convinced that the Justice Department has been biased against him. They believe Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to win the 2016 presidential election is politically motivated. They know that the Clinton campaign funded a “dirty tricks” dossier that led to a court warrant allowing surveillance of Trump associates. They know that numerous people working for Mueller had ties to Hillary Clinton and opposed Trump’s election. For this and other reasons, much of the country no longer supports the special counsel and his work.

Trump supporters think an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s actions was inadequate and tainted. The FBI conducted a far too limited investigation of Clinton’s use of her own private computer server to handle her email communications – including classified emails – when she was secretary of state. Clinton then lied about what seems to be a clear security breach. Her aides were granted immunity in the investigation for no apparent purpose, and her interview with the FBI was not recorded in any fashion. On top of that, Attorney General Loretta Lynch met secretly with former President Bill Clinton during the probe of his wife. This all seems highly suspect.

Many Trump supporters believe writer Peter Schweizer disclosed wrongdoing by the Clintons and their foundation. Schweizer is the author of the book “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Business Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.” The book documents numerous instances of apparent pay-to-play involving questionable donations to the Clinton Foundation and exorbitant speaking fees paid to former President Bill Clinton by organizations that had received favors from then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump fans wonder why the investigations into those activities were sidelined by the FBI.

The Mueller probe has yet to disclose any evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Democrats are giddy that White House Counsel Don McGahn spoke openly with Mueller’s team, assuming he may have revealed damaging information about President Trump. Trump voters consider the openness indicative of innocence on the part of the president, who approved the conversations. The White House has operated under a cloud of suspicion for well over a year, beset by allegations that are as yet unfounded. Millions of Americans believe, as the president has said, that the Mueller investigation is a witch hunt; two-thirds of the country thinks it should be brought to a close.

The media coverage of the Trump presidency has been almost laughably biased. The persistent focus on “Russia, Russia, Russia” is meant, supporters think, to distract from the accelerating economy and other achievements of the Trump White House.

Trump backers knew they were not voting for a choir boy. If they harbored any such notions, the release of the “Access Hollywood” tape shortly before the 2016 presidential election put those to rest. People do not condone Trump’s language on the tape and his alleged behavior with women, but they do not think it criminal or disqualifying. If Trump follows through on campaign promises, and the country is better off under his guidance, they are willing to look the other way.

Paying a woman to keep mum about an alleged sexual relationship is understandable. Two women received payments from Trump after they claimed to have had consensual sex with him – although he denies their claims. Either way, reaching a financial settlement with the women to not publicly air their charges appears to be a reasonable action by a wealthy married man, much less someone running for office. To many, the payments to the two women do not rise to the level of “high crimes and misdemeanors” that would justify impeachment of the president and his removal from office.

All these are some of the reasons that many Trump voters will cite for their continued support of the president.

Most Americans are too busy to follow every twist and turn of the Mueller investigation, the melodrama around fired FBI Director James Comey, the lying and leaking of fired No. 2 FBI official Andrew McCabe, the disgraceful saga of Trump-hating lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page at the FBI, or the myriad other rivulets feeding into the torrent of partisan bitterness infecting our politics.

But Trump supporters have a sense that Justice Department holdovers from the Obama years – and indeed officials high up in that administration – were furious at Trump’s election and have worked to undermine his administration from Day One.

More importantly, people who voted for Trump are happy with the way our country is going. In recent months, according to Gallup, the percentage of Americans “satisfied” with the direction of the country was higher than at any time since 2005.

People are optimistic, they are upbeat about their finances, they are enjoying wage hikes, and their ability to quit and find a better job. As their incomes rise, they are spending more (retail sales in July were up over 6 percent) and going out to eat more often. Spending at restaurants was ahead nearly 10 percent in July.

People are feeling flush, and are giving President Trump credit for producing a humdinger of an economy.

Democrats are dumbfounded by the very high approval ratings Trump earns from Republicans. In Gallup’s latest weekly tally, 87 percent of the Republicans said they approve of the president’s job performance, compared to only 7 percent of Democrats. It’s an unbridgeable gulf, and thanks in part to the intemperance of the liberal media it is likely to stay that way.

Come November, we will get a better reading of how President Trump’s legal problems sort out politically. There may well be further developments stemming from Paul Manafort’s second trial, scheduled for next month, or more revelations from Michael Cohen, whose lawyer has hinted he may have information that could damage the president.

With or without more bad news, President Trump’s fate will be determined by the steadfastness of his supporters – and on whether Democrats overplay their hand. Midterm elections are decided by turnout; impeachment talk will drive Trump’s deplorables to the polls. As of today, they still have his back.",politics
"President Trump issued a four-word reply Saturday after several speakers at weekend funerals for singer Aretha Franklin and U.S. Sen. John McCain made him a focus of their remarks.

“MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” the president tweeted around 7 p.m. ET.

Earlier Saturday, Meghan McCain, daughter of the late Arizona Republican, had alluded to Trump's slogan during her eulogy for her father, who died of brain cancer at age 81 on Aug. 25.

“The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great,” McCain said at a memorial service at the National Cathedral in Washington.

“The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.” - Meghan McCain, daughter of the late U.S. Sen. John McCain

The audience, which included a who’s who of Washington elites, applauded the comment, the Arizona Republic reported.

The late senator, a fervent critic of the president, had requested that Trump not be invited to his funeral. Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, however, were in attendance.

Much of the animus between Trump and McCain can be traced to a remark Trump made in July 2015, at an event in Ames, Iowa.

“He’s not a war hero,” Trump said of McCain, a Navy veteran who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”

While mourners attended McCain's memorial service, the president was playing golf at the Trump National Golf Club in Loudoun County, Va.

On Friday in Detroit, singer Stevie Wonder also made reference to Trump's slogan during his tribute to Franklin, the legendary recording artist who died of pancreatic cancer at age 76 on Aug. 16.

“What needs to happen today, not only in this nation but throughout the world, is that we need to make love great again,” Wonder said, according to the Hill.

“What needs to happen today, not only in this nation but throughout the world, is that we need to make love great again.” - Stevie Wonder, speaking at a memorial service for Aretha Franklin

Wonder was just one of several speakers in Detroit who, directly or indirectly, took verbal shots at Trump. Other critics of the president included Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson, the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

Meanwhile, Katrina Pierson, an adviser to Trump’s campaign, came to the president's defense following the weekend of insults.

“(Donald Trump) ran for @POTUS ONE time and WON! Some people will never recover from that. #SorryNotSorry Yes, #MAGA,” Pierson tweeted.",politics

Mauritius told U.N. judges Monday that the Indian Ocean nation was strong-armed by former colonial power Britain into giving up part of its territory as a condition for gaining independence half a century ago, in a case that could have an impact on a strategically important U.S. military base.

The claim came as judges at the International Court of Justice began hearing arguments in a U.N. General Assembly request for an advisory opinion on the legality of British sovereignty over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean that include Diego Garcia, home to a major U.S. military base.

""The process of decolonization of Mauritius remains incomplete as a result of the unlawful detachment of an integral part of our territory on the eve of our independence,"" Mauritius Defense Minister Anerood Jugnauth told judges.

Mauritius argues that the Chagos archipelago was part of its territory since at least the 18th century and was unlawfully taken by the U.K. in 1965, three years before the island nation gained independence. Britain insists it has sovereignty over the archipelago, which it calls the British Indian Ocean Territory.

Jugnauth said that during independence negotiations, then-British Prime Minister Harold Wilson told Mauritius' leader, Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, that ""he and his colleagues could return to Mauritius either with independence or without it and that the best solution for all might be independence and detachment (of the Chagos Islands) by agreement.""

Ramgoolam understood Wilson's words ""to be in the nature of a threat,"" Jugnauth said.

The U.K. sealed a deal with the U.S. in 1966 to use the territory for defense purposes. Washington maintains a forward operating location there for aircraft and ships that contribute to regional and global security.

Jugnauth said that the base shouldn't be affected by the court's ruling.

""Mauritius has been clear that a request for an advisory opinion is not intended to bring into question the presence of the base on Diego Garcia,"" he told judges. ""Mauritius recognizes its existence and has repeatedly made it clear to the United States and the administering power that it accepts the future of the base.""

Britain was due to address the court later Monday. The U.S., which has backed Britain on the issue, is among about 20 other nations and the African Union due to speak in the case this week.

Judges are expected to take months to issue their advisory opinions on two questions: Was the process of decolonization of Mauritius lawfully completed in 1968 and what are the consequences under international law of the U.K.'s continued administration, including with respect to the inability to resettle Chagos residents on the islands?

Britain evicted about 2,000 people from the Chagos archipelago in the 1960s and 1970s so the U.S. military could build an air base on Diego Garcia. The islanders were sent to the Seychelles and Mauritius, and many eventually resettled in the U.K.

The Chagossians have fought in British courts for years to return to the islands. In 2016, the Supreme Court rejected their most recent appeal.

A small group of Chagossians protested outside the court Monday holding banners including one that read: ""Chagossian sacrifice to protect the world but our reward is slow death.""",world
"President Trump initially decided against releasing an official White House statement on Sen. John McCain following his death, two administration sources confirmed to Fox News.

Continue Reading Below

The statement would have praised him for his decades of service and his heroism as a Vietnam War POW. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and other senior aides all had pushed for such a statement, which would have called McCain a “hero.”

The president, however, rejected the statement and instead issued a brief tweet Saturday night following the legendary Arizona Republican senator’s death.

The tweet said, “My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!”

The decision on the statement was first reported by The Washington Post.

The president eventually issued a statement late Monday afternoon announcing top officials will attend McCain's service, Vice President Pence will speak at a Capitol ceremony on Friday and U.S. flags will fly at half-staff until his internment.

""Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain’s service to our country and, in his honor, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment,"" Trump said, in a statement largely focused on the services of the coming days.

Trump’s decision to nix the earlier statement speaks to the longstanding feud between the two men, dating back to when Trump, as a candidate, said McCain was not a war hero and seemed to fault him for being captured during the Vietnam War. McCain endured five years in captivity, an experience that later shaped his views, as a senator, on interrogation techniques. Known as the Senate’s “maverick,” McCain often bucked party ideology, earning him praise on Democratic side of the aisle and sometimes criticism from his own party – but he remained an influential voice even through his battle with brain cancer. He twice ran for president and was the Republican Party’s presidential nominee in 2008.

Tributes to McCain, meanwhile, poured in from other world leaders and statesmen including former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.

“Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did. But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own,” Barack and Michelle Obama said in their statement.

“In an era filled with cynicism about national unity and public service, John McCain’s life shone as a bright example. He showed us that boundless patriotism and self-sacrifice are not outdated concepts or clichés, but the building blocks of an extraordinary American life,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement.

McConnell also announced that McCain will lie in State at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.",politics

The Latest on North Korea's 70th anniversary celebration (all times local):

5:25 p.m.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has congratulated Kim Jong Un and North Korea on the 70th anniversary of the country's founding, hailing once again what he has called the ""new historical period"" that North Korea has entered.

China has portrayed itself as a stable partner should the North step up efforts to pursue economic development.

Xi said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency, ""In recent years, the Korean party and people led by comrade chairman (Kim) took a series of positive measures in economic and social development and achieved important outcomes. The development of North Korea's socialist cause entered a new historical period. I am very happy about this.""

Xi said he is willing to work with Kim to develop healthy relations between the sides and to promote regional peace and stability.

___

1:25 p.m.

North Korea has staged a huge military parade to mark its 70th anniversary as a nation but held back its most advanced missiles and devoted nearly half of the parade to civilian efforts to build the domestic economy.

The strong emphasis on the economy underscores leader Kim Jong Un's new strategy of putting economic development front and center.

Kim attended the morning parade but did not address the assembled crowd, which included the head of the Chinese parliament and high-level delegations from countries that have friendly ties with the North.

Senior statesman Kim Yong Nam, the head of North Korea's parliament, set the relatively softer tone for the event with an opening speech that emphasized the economic goals of the regime, not its nuclear might.",world
"President Trump asserted on Monday that he would be ""totally allowed"" to take over Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe if he wanted to, in another thinly veiled broadside against an investigation he has repeatedly derided as a partisan ""witch hunt.""

""I can go in, and I could do whatever — I could run it if I want,"" Trump told Reuters. ""But I decided to stay out. I’m totally allowed to be involved if I wanted to be. So far, I haven’t chosen to be involved. I’ll stay out.""



The extraordinary comment -- apparently a reference to Trump's executive authority to order Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein at the Justice Department to fire or replace Mueller -- came as jurors continued to deliberate in the first trial brought as a result of Mueller's probe. There was no verdict in the case on Monday, raising the defense team's hopes after three days of deliberations.

Trump also repeated the concerns raised publicly by his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that speaking with Mueller's team directly would expose him to perjury charges, even if he told the truth.

TRUMP LASHES OUT AT MUELLER 'THUGS' IN MONDAY TWEETS, CALLS SPECIAL COUNSEL A 'NATIONAL DISGRACE'

“So if I say something and [former FBI Director James Comey] says something, and it’s my word against his, and he’s best friends with Mueller, so Mueller might say: ‘Well, I believe Comey,’ and even if I’m telling the truth, that makes me a liar,"" Trump said. ""That’s no good.”

Speaking exclusively to Fox News' ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" Monday night, Giuliani defended his comment Sunday that ""truth isn't truth,"" which drew a firestorm of criticism on social media. Prosecutors can bring perjury charges against an honest witness, Giuliani said, as long as they can find others to present an alternative version of events.

Giuliani also alleged that Mueller's team was trying to cause political damage for Trump, even though, he said, prosecutors had assured him they did not want to repeat Comey's mistakes.

""They're trying to run this right up until the election,"" Giuliani said, calling the investigation a ""travesty.""

""They're trying to do the same thing Comey did -- they're trying to be the judge and jury of the 2018 election,"" he added.

Giuliani also downplayed a report over the weekend that White House Counsel Don McGahn had extensive meetings with Mueller, saying McGahn is an ""honorable"" man who would have resigned long ago if Trump had told him to do anything illegal.

""They're trying to do the same thing Comey did -- they're trying to be the judge and jury of the 2018 election."" - Rudy Giuliani

""I can't imagine him sitting around the White House for six months with a president he thinks committed a crime,"" Giuliani said.

Trump also told Reuters that he hadn't ""given a lot of thought"" to the possibility of revoking Mueller's security clearance -- a move that would be sure to trigger a political uproar in Washington and potentially unravel the Mueller probe.

Last week, the White House terminated ex-CIA Director John Brennan's security clearance, charging that he had misled Congress about the CIA's role in spying on Senate staffers and improperly politicized his access to classified information with his attacks on the president.

Trump told Reuters the Mueller probe had “played right into the Russians - if it was Russia - they played right into the Russians’ hands.”

Separately, Trump also responded to the news that several tech giants, including Google, Apple, Facebook, and Twitter, had removed or banned content from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.

""I won't mention names, but when they take certain people off of Twitter or Facebook and they're making that decision, that is really a dangerous thing because that could be you tomorrow,"" Trump said.

"The leading Democratic candidate for governor in Arizona has accepted the resignation of a campaign staffer after a conservative blog uncovered some inflammatory tweets.

Xenia Orona was the digital director for gubernatorial hopeful David Garcia. However, after her past tweets surfaced – some from several years ago – the campaign accepted her resignation, Fox News confirmed on Friday afternoon.

""The language and the message of the tweets are not in line with the values and message of our campaign. The staff person involved offered her resignation and the campaign accepted it,"" a spokesperson for the candidate told Fox News in a statement.

In November 2012, on Election Day, Orona reportedly tweeted, “An open letter to Arizona: F--- you,” according to a screenshot published by PJ Media.

Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney beat President Barack Obama in Arizona in 2012 with more than 54 percent of the vote.

In another tweet, Orona appeared to call the U.S. a “s---hole country.”

“I am a business owner and a creative. I am a college graduate, the first of many in my family. I am involved in multiple campaigns to make Arizona a better place,” she said. “I am from 5 generations of border crossers between this [s---hole] country and la Madre Tierra of Mexico.”

In January, President Trump was accused of describing African nations as “s---hole countries.” Orona’s tweet was published on Jan. 12, according to PJ Media’s screenshot.

Additionally, she called for the elimination of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement – a growing call among progressive Democrats – and said “law and order is the smokescreen that bigots hide their hate behind,” according to PJ Media.

Orona’s Twitter account has since been made private.

KPNX-TV reporter Brahm Resnik, who confirmed the resignation on Thursday night, said the campaign learned about the tweets from PJ Media's posts.",politics
"Vice President Mike Pence contended Tuesday that President Trump's administration inherited a ""cyber-crisis"" when he took office, laying the blame for Russian meddling on the Obama administration.

“[S]adly, previous administrations have let the American people down when it came to cyber defense,” Pence said in a speech at the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity Summit in New York City. “At the outset of this administration, it became clear from early on: In a very real sense, we inherited a cyber-crisis.”

“Sadly, previous administrations have let the American people down when it came to cyber defense. At the outset of this administration, it became clear from early on: In a very real sense, we inherited a cyber-crisis.” - Vice President Mike Pence

Pence suggested the Obama administration was to blame for major security breaches in recent years, such as the Equifax hack -- which affected the data of half the U.S. population -- and the hack at the federal Office of Personnel Management, which affected about 18 million people, CNet.com reported.

Pence vowed the White House would take proactive measures to overhaul the country’s cyber-security systems, to prevent another attack.

The vice president also derided Russia for interfering in the 2016 presidential election and vowed the Trump administration would do more to prevent future cyber-attacks.

Pence’s denouncement of Russia was unprecedented, given President Trump’s ambiguous stance on election meddling, the Wall Street Journal reported.

“While other nations certainly possess the capability, the fact is Russia meddled in our 2016 elections,” Pence said, “That is the unambiguous judgment of our intelligence community, and, as the president said, we accept the intelligence community’s conclusion.”

Trump was widely criticized for appearing to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's assurance that Russia had not interfered in the 2016 election – just days after Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officials. But following widespread backlash, Trump reversed his position.

At the same New York event, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced several initiatives to combat future threats, Politico reported, including an election security task force, a supply chain task force and a National Risk Management center.

The risk management center will reportedly work to safeguard the nation’s banks, energy companies, and other major industries, the Journal reported.

“[O]ur digital lives are now in danger every single day,” Nielsen said, adding that the next 9/11 attack would likely “reach us online” rather “than on an airplane.”

"The judge in the Paul Manafort trial reminded Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team on Friday of the high bar for conviction -- that they must prove the former Trump campaign chairman knowingly violated tax and bank laws related to his political work overseas.

On the trial's fourth day, U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis III indicated he believes the prosecution has demonstrated Manafort had control of foreign bank accounts despite checking a box on tax returns saying he didn’t have them.

But Ellis reminded prosecutors, “The government has to prove that [Manafort] knew what the requirement was and that he deliberately violated it.”

Ellis also reminded prosecutors they have to prove Manafort's “willfulness” in failing to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts.

Manafort, facing charges of bank and tax fraud related to his political work in Ukraine, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

MANAFORT STRUGGLED TO PAY BILLS IN 2016, BOOKKEEPER TESTIFIES

A source close to Manafort’s team told Fox News the defense has not yet decided whether to have Manafort testify during the trial. This person said they will make the decision after the prosecution rests its case, which could be next week.

Friday’s testimony has focused on the tax fraud charges. The years involved, 2010 to 2014, were before Manafort worked for President Trump's campaign. Though the case stems from Mueller's probe of election meddling by Russia and possible collusion by the Trump campaign, there has been no mention of election interference.

Manafort served as chairman of Trump’s presidential campaign during the summer of 2016, and was forced out in August of that year amid news stories about his ties to then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

On Friday, Philip Ayliff, a CPA who prepared Manafort’s taxes, testified Manafort signed tax returns that showed “none” checked for any foreign bank accounts between the years 2010 and 2014.

The government pointed out that Manafort signed his tax returns “under penalty of perjury.""

Prosecutor Uza Asonye walked Ayliff through each year and asked “what did Mr. Manafort say for this year for foreign bank accounts?”

Ayliff responded “none” for each one.

The prosecution also showed documents where the accountant emailed Manafort asking if he had foreign accounts, and Manafort responded that he didn't.

But Mueller's team says Manafort repeatedly used accounts in Cyprus to pay for an array of luxury items and services.

Prosecutors have introduced a host of exhibits and are in the process of calling several witnesses as part of their effort to paint Manafort as a tax scofflaw who failed to report money spent on luxury items -- then lied to get bank loans when his foreign consulting work dried up.

The prosecution has released exhibit photos of Manafort's expensive clothes, including a $15,000 ostrich coat and other pricey suits.

On Thursday, Manafort’s bookkeeper, Heather Washkuhn of the firm NKFSB, testified that Manafort racked up large bills but struggled to pay them in 2016.

“Did there come a time in 2016 when Mr. Manafort had trouble paying his bills?” prosecutor Greg Andres asked the accountant in federal court in Alexandria, Va.

“Yes,” Washkuhn replied.

The Manafort defense hinges on convincing jurors that Manafort was the boss who didn’t handle bills or accounts, but left that to his deputy, Rick Gates, who is cooperating with prosecutors and may testify as its star witness.

“Rick Gates had his hand in the cookie jar and couldn’t let his boss find out,” Manafort defense attorney Thomas Zehnle said during opening arguments.

Ellis, a 78-year-old Reagan-appointed judge in the case known for colorful comments, said this week the prosecution cannot prove a key part of their case unless prosecutors call Gates to the stand.

"Historians and journalists on Tuesday tweeted out the hand-written love letter that future President George H.W. Bush sent to his then-fiancée Barbara Pierce on Dec. 12, 1943.

Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, tweeted that Bush was a U.S. Navy pilot at the time during World War II. The letter written in blue ink on Navy stationery and begins: ""My darling Bar.""

The future president begins by telling her how happy he was to read their engagement announcement in the newspaper.

“I love you, precious, with all my heart and to know that you love me means my life. How often I have thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours someday. How lucky our children will be to have a mother like you,” the letter read.

The two met at a Christmas dance. She was 17. He was 18. The future president was a naval aviator in training.

""I'm not much at recalling what people wear, but that particular occasion stands out in my memory,"" he wrote in his autobiography.

The band was playing Glenn Miller tunes and he asked a friend from Rye, N.Y., if he knew the girl across the room in the green and red holiday dress.

The friend introduced him to Barbara Pierce, a publisher's daughter from Rye who was going to school in South Carolina. The next song was a waltz.

""Since I didn't waltz, we sat the dance out. And several more after that, talking and getting to know each other,"" Bush wrote. ""It was a storybook meeting.""

Barbara Bush, 92, died Tuesday, shortly after her family announced she was in failing health and would decline further medical treatment in favor of ""comfort care."" There were no details of her specific health problems.

In a statement, one of her sons, former President George W. Bush, called his mother ""a fabulous First Lady and a woman unlike any other.""

The two were married Jan. 6, 1945, four months after the elder Bush was shot down over the Pacific. He'd been the Navy's youngest aviator when he got his wings and carried the name ""Barbara"" on his Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber.

The letter, which was kept in the former first lady’s scrapbook, goes on to mention the war and the mission, but the young pilot wrote that he couldn’t wait to return to her.

“This may sound melodramamtic, but if it does it is only my inadequacy to say what I mean. Bar, you have made my life full of everything I could ever dream of — my complete happiness should be a token of my love for you.”

"President Trump on Wednesday mourned the loss of a U.S. Secret Service agent who suffered a stroke on Monday during the president's recent trip overseas.

Special Agent Nole Edward Remagen, 42, died Tuesday in Scotland, surrounded by his immediate family and Secret Service colleagues.

A 19-year veteran of the Secret Service, Remagen's body was returned to the U.S. on Wednesday.

""Our prayers are with Special Agent Remagen's loved ones, including his wife and two young children,"" Trump said in a statement Wednesday. ""We grieve with them and with his Secret Service colleagues, who have lost a friend and a brother.""

""Melania and I are deeply grateful for his lifetime of devotion, and today, we pause to honor his life and 24 years of service to our Nation,"" Trump said.

The first lady took to Twitter to express her ""deepest condolences"" to Remagen's family, noting that the Secret Service ""work tirelessly & often behind the scenes to keep our family safe.""

Remagen, according to the White House's statement, spent five years in the Marine Corps before joining the Secret Service, where he worked as park of the Presidential Protection Division.

The service said Remagen ""exemplified the core values of the Secret Service - Justice, Duty, Courage, Honesty and Loyalty.""

The Trumps attended a ceremony for Remagen Wednesday at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where the agent's body arrived. Vice President Pence, who called Remagen ""a courageous American,"" and his wife Karen, also paid their respects.

The wife of Sen. McCain, Cindy McCain, said on Twitter “My heart is broken.”

“I am so lucky to have lived the adventure of loving this incredible man for 38 years.” She said that he died at home, in the way that he lived his life, “on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved.”

“America and Freedom have lost one of her greatest Champions,” he said.

Graham said that he would “need time to absorb this” but that the McCain family “are in my prayers.”

President Barack Obama, who ran against McCain for the presidency in 2008, said that Americans remain in the former senator’s debt because of all that he did for the country.

“John McCain and I were members of different generations, came from completely different backgrounds, and competed at the highest level of politics,” Obama said. “But we shared, for all our differences, a fidelity to something higher – the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants, alike have fought, marched, and sacrificed.”

“Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did,” Obama stated. “But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own. At John’s best he showed us what that means.”

Former President George W. Bush called McCain a friend that he would “deeply miss.”

“John McCain was a man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order. He was a public servant in the finest traditions of our country.”

Former President Bill Clinton also issued a statement:

""John McCain believed that every citizen has a responsibility to make something of the freedoms given by our Constitution, and from his heroic service in the Navy to his 35 years in Congress, he lived by his creed every day,"" Clinton wrote.

“He never forgot the great duty he felt to care for our nation’s heroes, dedicating his spirit and energy to ensuring that no man or woman in uniform was left behind on the battlefield or once they returned home,” she said both of his military career and political career.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called McCain one of “few truly great people” you encounter in life. He announced that he would be introducing a resolution to rename the Russell Senate Office Building after the late McCain.

Defense Secretary James Mattis said that McCain, as a U.S. Naval officer and a “defiant prisoner of war,” was a man “who steadfastly represented the best ideals of our country” and was “passionately committed” to the U.S.

HERE'S A LOOK AT JOHN MCCAIN'S POLITICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS

Mattis said the Department of Defense “will remain forever grateful for the life, the passion, and the example of Senator John McCain.”

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey called McCain ""a giant. An icon. An American hero.""

""As we mourn his passing and celebrate his truly phenomenal life,"" Ducey added, ""we're also faced with the void John McCain's absence leaves in the heart and soul of our nation.""

Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer wrote that McCain's death was ""heartbreaking news."" She called McCain ""a warrior who fought for his country and for his beloved state of Arizona.""

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was McCain's running mate in 2008, said that on Saturday, the world “lost an American original.”

Palin said McCain “was a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs … and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self.”

“I will remember the good times,” Palin added.",politics
"The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has benefited American consumers, workers and businesses since 1994. But ignoring the agreement’s success, President Trump instead chooses to denounce NAFTA, often suggesting the U.S. could withdraw altogether.

NAFTA has been a major source of economic growth in the United States, particularly for the automotive and agricultural sectors. Some 14 million U.S. jobs depend on the agreement with our nation’s two largest export markets, Canada and Mexico. Together, these countries spend nearly $500 billion purchasing U.S. exports annually.

President Trump’s approach to NAFTA is just one part of a misguided protectionist agenda. Unless his administration makes major course corrections, our economy will experience three attacks of severe pain from the president’s trade measures.

First, the president announced in late May that the U.S. would begin imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico, China and the European Union. The move was widely panned by American business leaders as damaging to U.S. economic interests, especially for an automotive sector that depends heavily on steel and aluminum.

In Tennessee, a Trump electoral stronghold, more than 135,000 workers depend on the auto sector, building more than 830,000 vehicles annually. According to the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce & Industry, President Trump’s tariffs could endanger the state’s automotive base.

To the east, North Carolina’s craft beer industry has its own concerns. With more than 260 breweries, North Carolina’s craft beer industry says that aluminum and steel tariffs not only make cans more expensive, but raise the price of machinery. Gibbs Hundred Brewing Company of Greensboro says that 60 percent of its beer is packaged in aluminum cans.

Similarly, the oil and gas industry in Texas points out that steel tariffs will raise the costs of pipeline construction. Few economic sectors will be free from the pain of rising steel and aluminum prices.

Second, the Trump administration has sought to eliminate NAFTA’s Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanism, a vital defense for U.S. companies that invest abroad. Without this protection, U.S.-based multinational corporations are likely to cut back on outward investment, undermining job creation and export-related growth in the United States.

The Peterson Institute’s research shows that overseas investment is an engine for American job creation. For example, case studies in Mexico show a win-win relationship from establishing research and development facilities outside the U.S.: every 131 jobs added in Mexico lead to 333 jobs created here at home.

Eliminating the ISDS mechanism, as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has proposed, will not only slow U.S. job creation, it will also endanger U.S. property rights abroad.

Third, President Trump’s refusal to fully stand behind NAFTA could deal a painful blow to U.S. agriculture. NAFTA has fostered robust growth in agricultural exports over the past 24 years.

Today agriculture is a multibillion-dollar market between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, according to the National Corn Growers Association.

North Dakota Commerce Commissioner Jay Schuler notes that North Dakota’s farmers export 84 percent of their crops – totaling $3.5 billion – to Mexico and Canada.

An ImpactECON study found that withdrawal from NAFTA, and the resulting retaliation, could mean a loss of at least 50,000 jobs in the U.S. agriculture sector and a gross domestic product loss of about $13 billion.

Potential withdrawal from NAFTA isn’t the only plank of the president’s trade agenda that could cause pain for agriculture. An Iowa State University economist calculated his state’s farmers could lose up to $624 million because of the president’s tit-for-tat tariff war with China.

Enormous quantities of U.S. corn, wheat, soybeans, fruits, nuts, and pork are exported abroad, but the specter of trade wars casts a heavy pall over American farmers.

President Trump has a clear choice: keep American business competitive internationally or travel down a protectionist path that visits severe pain on sectors of the American economy. The president should listen to U.S. businesses and reverse course before it’s too late.",politics
"It is said there are decades where nothing happens. And there are weeks where decades happen.

Congress has a version of this. It’s a month called “August.” Crazy congressional things happen in August. This is ironic because, well, Congress is supposed to be on recess in August.

But the biggest question buzzing around Capitol Hill now is whether the Senate will cancel or shorten that recess – and meet anyway.

President Trump initiated this year’s fretting over a canceled recess with a tweet:

“The Senate should get funding done before the August break, or NOT GO HOME. Wall and Border Security should be included. Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations, worst in history. Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct, all they know how to do. STAY!”

A group of GOP senators then launched an effort to stay through the summer’s hottest stretch.

“It is time to drain the swamp. We can help do that by keeping the pumps running in August,” said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.

Daines and others want the Senate to stick around to wrap up spending bills and confirm Trump’s nominees. Democrats may suggest there’s an ulterior motive. Republicans hold a narrow, 51-49 edge in the Senate. Thirty-three seats are up this fall. A staggering 24 of them are held by Democrats compared with just nine for Republicans. Many Democrats facing re-election represent battleground or red states: Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.; Jon Tester, D-Mont.; Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.; Bob Casey, D-Pa., and others. Meantime, Republicans are defending conservative strongholds like Wyoming.

The field is tilted toward the Republicans. It’s a freak of political nature. But neither party has faced an electoral map this challenging since 1938.

So, it’s a great strategy for Republicans to tether Democrats to Washington and rob them of valuable campaign time at home. Meantime, GOP challengers can barnstorm those same states.

There was a big push in the Senate last year to gut the August recess over nominations and the annual defense bill.

But it didn’t really work out. The House cut town. The Senate hung around for a few days in early August, knocking out a massive slate of 77 nominees in one fell swoop with no debate, and got out of Dodge.

But things are different in an election year. Plus, voters are perpetually anguished about Congress “not getting anything done.” Therefore, it looks great to remain in session.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was circumspect when asked about carbonizing the recess.

“I’ll have more to say about the August break in the near future,” the Kentucky Republican replied.

Many senators fully expect the Senate to conduct business during at least a part of August -- even if it’s a pantomime for optics or plays out like last summer: in for a few days and then gone.

But what can the Senate really accomplish in August when it comes to the annual spending bills?

A senior Senate Republican source says the Senate may remain in session to work out nominations, but not appropriations.

Here’s the problem:

President Trump is irate over the $1.3 trillion spending bill he signed into law in March to avoid a government shutdown.

“I will never sign another bill like this again,” thundered the president after taking fire from conservatives.

Congress and the president must come to terms with the next round of spending before Sept. 30. Expect DACA, immigration and funding for a border wall to emerge as flashpoints. Democrats and Republicans are working feverishly behind the scenes to reach an accord on spending bills before the Sept. 30 deadline.

It’s unclear whether either body of Congress can knock out a handful of spending bills at all before August. This is why Congress often lumps the 12 annual spending bills into a gigantic, legislative slab and passes them at once. This is what infuriates the president.

There may be an effort to ditch the “omnibus” effort where lawmakers fuse the bills into one. Instead, lawmakers may try a “mini-bus” approach, mixing just two or three bills together.

But something else could derail the appropriations process. Republicans recently cobbled together a “rescissions” bill. A rescissions measure does just that. It cancels spending Congress already allocated.

The Republican effort to nullify old spending could jeopardize good-faith efforts to finish the spending bills in a timely manner.

“Senator McConnell and I, we’re getting along very well. I think we even enjoy each other’s company. He laughs at my jokes,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

But Schumer says the rescissions effort “is going to make it harder to get the appropriations process moving forward in a bipartisan way.”

In the old days, Congress deserted Washington in August because it was hotter than fire. The Founders erected the city on a swamp, and the Capitol lacked air conditioning. Thank to Willis Carrier, the inventor of air conditioning, lawmakers no longer have to leave.

This August could be eventful. Or not at all. There could be the illusion where the Senate is meeting – but key votes are only scheduled on certain days, luring everyone back to town. That could maintain the charade that the Senate is “in session working over the August recess.”

So there may be a few days in August where a decade happens. Or maybe nothing at all.

"A fugitive wanted since June for allegedly threatening President Trump and others may have been spotted in eastern Pennsylvania early Friday, officials said.

Shawn Christy, 26, may have been spotted in Rush Township, about 3 miles south of his home in McAdoo, the Morning Call reported. Rush is about 112 miles north of Allentown.

“Yeah, we’re working on it,” Deputy U.S. Marshal Robert Clark told the newspaper. “Nothing’s been confirmed.”

Christy has been the subject of a large-scale search by the U.S. Marshals, FBI and U.S. Secret Service for allegedly threatening “to put a bullet” in the president’s head as well as making a death threat against a local district attorney.

A man described as having a scruffy beard broke into a house near the Still Creek Reservoir after removing an air conditioner, according to the Morning Call. He was reportedly chased by the homeowner around 2 a.m.

Residents said they believe the man was looking for food.

A federal arrest warrant was issued for Christy on June 19 when he allegedly posted a message on Facebook saying, “Keep it up Morganelli, I promise I’ll put a bullet in your head as soon as I put one in the head of President Donald J. Trump,” referring to Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli.

The Facebook post has since been deleted, Washington's FOX 5 DC reported.

The manhunt has taken officials to several states. The FBI said Christy is believed to have numerous stolen handguns.

"President Trump has revoked the security clearance for former CIA Director John Brennan, the White House announced Wednesday, in the first decision to come from a review of access for several top Obama-era intelligence and law enforcement officials.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders read a statement on behalf of the president during the start of the press briefing, saying Brennan ""has a history that calls his credibility into question.""

The statement also claimed Brennan had been ""leveraging"" the clearance to make ""wild outbursts"" and claims against the Trump administration in the media.

""The president has a constitutional responsibility to protect classified information and who has access to it, and that’s what he’s doing is fulfilling that responsibility in this action,"" Sanders said Wednesday.

In response, Brennan tweeted hours later: ""This action is part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to suppress freedom of speech & punish critics. It should gravely worry all American's, including intelligence professioanls, about the cost of speaking out. My principles are worth far more than clearances. I will not relent.""

Last month, the White House said they were looking into the clearances for other former officials and Trump critics, including former FBI director James Comey; former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe; former director of national intelligence James Clapper; former national security adviser Susan Rice and former CIA director Michael Hayden (who also worked under President George W. Bush).

On Wednesday, Sanders added to the list Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, former FBI agent Peter Strzok (who was fired from the bureau last week) and former FBI general counsel Lisa Page.

""This is specific to Mr. Brennan, and the others are currently under review,"" Sanders said.

The White House last month accused the former officials of having ""politicized"" or ""monetized"" their public service, and said their clearances gave ""inappropriate legitimacy to accusations with zero evidence.""

Brennan joined NBC News and MSNBC in February as a contributor and senior national security and intelligence analyst.

But Democrats blasted the administration for the clearance review, saying Trump politicized the process and had gone too far. Wednesday's announcement fueled those allegations.

""In adding John Brennan to his enemies list, Trump demonstrates again how deeply insecure and vindictive he is — two character flaws dangerous in any President,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., top House Intelligence Committee Democrat, tweeted. ""An enemies list is ugly, undemocratic and un-American. I also believe this action to silence a critic is unlawful.""

And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the move a ""stunning abuse of power.""

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called it an effort to ""scare away critics.""

He continued, ""This is clearly another effort to silence critics and not allow the Mueller investigation and for that matter the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation to get to the bottom of this.""

Former CIA deputy chief of staff for Brennan, Nick Shapiro, told Fox News last month that Brennan ""hasn’t made one penny off of his clearance.""

He added: ""This is a political attack on career national security officials who have honorably served their country for decades under both [Republicans] & [Democrats] in an effort to distract from [Special Counsel Robert] Mueller’s investigation.""

Comey reacted Wednesday night: ""Once again this president is sending a message that he will punish people who disagree with him and reward those who praise him.""

TRUMP'S FULL STATEMENT ON REVOKING JOHN BRENNAN'S SECURITY CLEARANCE

Aitan Goelman, an attorney for Strzok, said in a statement late Wednesday that security clearances ""should not be suspended or revoked as a way of punishing people who have criticized the President, or coercing others into silence.

""By revoking Director Brennan's clearance and threatening the security clearance of Pete and seven other former officials on Trump's 'enemies list,' the President has taken us down one more step on the path toward authoritarianism,"" Goelman added.

In his July 26-dated statement, Trump said: ""Mr. Brennan’s lying and recent conduct, characterized by increasingly frenzied commentary, is wholly inconsistent with access to the Nation’s most closely held secrets and facilitates the very aim of our adversaries, which is to sow division and chaos.""

But despite the ongoing review, several former officials suggested it would have no impact on them.

Following the White House’s initial announcement, Hayden tweeted that he doesn’t ""go back for classified briefings. Won’t have any effect on what I say or write.""

A friend of Comey’s, Benjamin Wittes, tweeted last month that the former FBI director doesn’t have a security clearance to revoke.

And Strzok, upon his removal from the bureau last month, lost his security clearance.

McCabe’s spokesperson Melissa Schwartz said his security clearance was deactivated when he was fired.

While Brennan is among the highest-profile on the list in terms of media appearances, Clapper and Hayden also are contributors for CNN. Rice frequently is a guest on news programs, and Comey recently finished a media blitz to promote his memoir, ""A Higher Loyalty,"" in May.

"The man who says he acted as a “go-between” last year to inform Sen. John McCain about the controversial “dossier” containing salacious allegations about then-candidate Donald Trump is speaking out, revealing how the ex-British spy who researched the document helped coordinate its release to the FBI, the media and Capitol Hill.

“My mission was essentially to be a go-between and a messenger, to tell the senator and assistants that such a dossier existed,” Sir Andrew Wood told Fox News in an exclusive interview with senior executive producer Pamela K. Browne.

Fox News spoke to Wood at the 2017 Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Canada. As Britain’s ambassador to Moscow from 1995-2000, Wood witnessed the end of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the rise of Vladimir Putin.

Just after the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, Arizona GOP Sen. McCain spoke at the same security conference. Wood says he was instructed — by former British spy Christopher Steele — to reach out to the senior Republican, whom Wood called “a good man,” about the unverified document.

Wood insists that he’s never read the dossier that his good friend and longtime colleague prepared. It was commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.

In August 2016, “[Steele] came to me to tell me what was in it, and why it … was important,” Wood said. “He made it very clear … yes, it was raw intelligence, but it needed putting into proper context before you could judge it fully.”

August 2016 is a critical period, just after the FBI opened the Russia meddling probe, and after then-director James Comey recommended against prosecution for Clinton’s mishandling of classified information.

Wood said Steele had “already been in contact with the FBI” at the time.

“He said there was corroborating evidence in the United States, from which I assumed he was working with an American company,” Wood said.

British court records reviewed by Fox News as well as U.S. congressional testimony revealed that Steele was directed and paid at least $168,000 by Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson to push the research that fall to five American media outlets. According to British court documents, Steele met with The New York Times (twice), The Washington Post (twice), CNN, The New Yorker and Yahoo News (twice).

“Each of these interviews was conducted in person and with a member of Fusion also present,” according to the records associated with separate civil litigation against Steele and Fusion GPS.

Wood said he’d heard of Fusion GPS, as the group Steele was working with, but had “never heard of Mr. Simpson.”

Three weeks after Trump won the presidential election, at the Canadian security conference, the details were finalized for the dossier hand-off to McCain.

Along with the senator, Wood and McCain Institute for International Leadership staffer David J. Kramer attended the Canadian conference.

British court records state McCain ordered Kramer to get a personal briefing from Steele in Surrey, just outside of London, and then return to Washington, D.C., where Fusion GPS would provide McCain with hard copies.

In January, McCain officially gave the dossier to the FBI, which already had its own copy from Steele.

Of note, listed in the official program for the 2016 November Canadian conference as a participant was Rinat Akhmetshin — the same Russian lobbyist who was at Trump Tower five months earlier in June for a highly scrutinized meeting with Donald Trump Jr. and others.

The senator’s office noted to Fox News that McCain said in January 2017 he had no contact with Akhmetshin. “Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.”

It is not known whether Akhmetshin had any contact with Kramer. Fusion GPS and Kramer did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News.

"They are risking their lives to bring freedom to Iran, and vow to continue their protests.

""These uprisings have just begun. People are not at all willing to give up,"" one activist told Fox News from the streets of Iran.

""Their patience has come to an end and they have nothing to lose. Iran will surely not fall down and people will not retreat from their demands.""

The defiance comes as President Trump announced Friday that he is waving sanctions against Iran under the controversial 2015 nuclear deal one last time, and gave the European allies four months to change the terms of the agreement or he may seek to scrap it.

The protesters we talked to demand even harsher sanctions.

""They should impose major sanctions on the regime,"" one protester demanded. Another added there ""should be sanctions for human rights violations.""

The protesters are members of the long banned opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI, also known as the MEK). The group's leader, Maryam Rajavi, has been directly blamed by the Iranian government for fomenting the unrest.

Social media videos show supporters unveiling large banners with Rajavi's photo over highway overpasses, and continuing their opposition.

Punitive measures sought

The group is calling for Iran’s oil exports to also be subject to sanctions, the ability of the Tehran regime to access the international banking system to be cut off, as well as other punitive measures.

The activists predict stronger methods will work, and are thanking the president and the American public for keeping up the pressure.

""We thank you President Trump. We call on all of the supporters of the people who press this regime from different fronts, to put pressure with you and overthrow with us,"" the activist told Fox News in broken English.

He and others said they are grateful that the Trump administration is expressing support for the resistance that has been staging many of the protests. The demonstrations started Dec. 28, and the government claims that they have largely been quelled.

That is why the activists are looking to the United States for inspiration -- and more help.

""Iranian people want to achieve a democratic and independent government, and play a role in it,"" said one.

""In Iran taxis and buses and public places, you heard people talking that they are happy that the United States and President Trump is actually taking actions on the side of the Iranian people and as you know, the overthrow of this regime and establishment of a free country is in the interest of the entire world.

“This support should continue, and years of appeasement should end. People are very determined and do not retreat despite this severe crackdown.""

The demonstrators deny the protests are largely over. Videos posted on social media show activists attacking government outposts, such as firebombing police stations, destroying government property, and chanting anti-regime slogans.

Common goal

Fox News interviewed the protesters through a social media app that demonstrators have been using to evade the government crackdown on the internet.

The protesters we interviewed asked that their locations remain hidden, and their voices altered or not even used at all, out of fears that they could be identified by the government and arrested.

But they all expressed a common goal. They insisted the movement will not end until the hardline theocratic regime is finally ousted.

""To reach this goal they know the value of the support,"" one activist told us.

The support from the White House has included President Trump's harsh criticism of the regime and its treatment of the demonstrators.

On Jan. 3, Trump tweeted: ""Such respect for the people of Iran as they try to take back their corrupt government. You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time!""

Earlier this week a White House statement condemned the regime and its mass arrests of protesters. It also said ""reports that the regime has tortured or killed some of these demonstrators while in detention are even more disturbing. We will not remain silent as the Iranian dictatorship represses the basic rights of its citizens and will hold Iran's leaders accountable for any violations.""

One activist was so scared that he refused to talk, and instead texted this about the president's views.

""He is correct and we approve of what he spoke. He should help the Iranian people. We need internet because the internet in Iran is banned. We ask President Trump to convince European Union to ban the Mullah. We want President Trump to widespread Iranian sound all over the world and show Mullah's injustice to the people of the world.""

'Obama failed to act'

In announcing the waiver decision, the president appeared to do just that. The White House statement included several references to the regime's treatment of the protesters:

""The Supreme Leader and his Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps use mass arrests and torture to oppress and silence Iran's people. ... We are calling on all nations to lend similar support to the Iranian people, who are suffering under a regime that is stifling basic freedoms and denying its citizens the opportunity to build better lives for their families -- an opportunity that is every human being's God-given right. ...

“President Obama failed to act as the Iranian people took to the streets in 2009. He turned a blind eye as Iran built and tested dangerous missiles and exported terror. ... (The Iran deal) has served as a slush fund for weapons, terror and oppression, and to further line the pockets of corrupt regime leaders. The Iranian people know this, which is one reason why so many have taken to the streets to express their outrage.""

The president's comments slamming the regime have been echoed by other top administration officials as well.

""Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world,"" Vice President Mike Pence told the Voice of America earlier this month. ""To see the people of Iran rising up, to demand change in their country, should hearten every freedom loving American and people who cherish freedom around the world.""

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the U.N. Security Council last week, ""They (the protesters) are acting of their own will, on their own behalf, for their own future. Nothing will stop Americans from standing in solidarity with them. In 2009, the world stood by passively while the hopes of the Iranian people were crushed by their government. In 2018, we will not be silent.""

Thousands arrested

The NCRI says there have been demonstrations in at least 132 cities and that upwards of 8,000 protesters have been arrested. One Iranian lawmaker was quoted as saying the number was closer to about 4,000.

One activist texted us that his motivation to overthrow the ruling regime, is simple.

""We have no life in Iran. Our life and death is equal. We have nothing to miss. We want freedom. Just poverty, unemployment and corruption is the result of the Mullah regime ... young people are unemployed. Educated people escape to other countries. Our country has a brain drain problem. The regime does not concern the Iranian people and suppresses any protest and throws people in jail. We want Mr. (Trump) to help us in whatever way he knows.""

Another was also very clear.

""Nobody wants to go back, we want to go forward. People what a free republic, that is what people have been chanting. We know that we need to be at risk for a revolution. This is an inevitable revolution and we accept it.""

"A court in Cambodia on Thursday extended by six months the pre-trial detention of Kem Sokha, the leader of the now-dissolved main opposition party who already has been held for a year on a treason charge.

One of Kem Sokha's lawyers, Chan Chen, said the court ruled in a closed-door hearing that his continued detention was necessary for national security and further investigation. The hearing was held at Trapeang Phlong prison in the eastern province of Tboung Khmum, where Kem Sokha is being held.

There were hopes among his supporters that he might be released because in the past two weeks more than 20 people imprisoned for political activities have been freed with pardons or on bail. Their releases came after Prime Minister Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won July's general election, sweeping all 125 National Assembly seats.

Kem Sokha was arrested last September on the basis of several-year-old videos showing him at a seminar where he spoke about receiving advice from U.S. pro-democracy groups. His opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party denied the treason allegation, calling it politically motivated. Another court last November dissolved the opposition party, saying it was plotting with U.S. assistance to overthrow Hun Sen's government.

Cambodia's courts are considered to be heavily politicized and under the influence of Hun Sen's ruling party. The Cambodia National Rescue Party presented the only viable political opposition, so its elimination from July's polls ensured a landslide victory for Hun Sen.

On Wednesday, Hun Sen said publicly that Kem Sokha would not be released and would not receive a pardon because he has not yet been convicted.",world
"As the Democrats shift to the left on a number of issues from health care to immigration, they’ve already gone all in on one of the most contentious issues around -- gun control

A study by The Wall Street Journal found that of the 63 candidates on the House Democrats’ campaign arm’s list of seats to flip in November, 62 support expanded background checks for gun purchases.

While Dems have long pushed for gun control, there was a time when some candidates ignored the issue, included gun rights as part of their platform or even allied with the National Rifle Association. But support for gun control among candidates has hardened in recent years after a rash of high-profile mass shootings including at schools -- most recently in Parkland, Florida in February and Santa Fe, Texas in May.

That shift is being reflected in activity on the campaign trail, with more Democrats being more vocal on gun control and their advocacy of proposals such as background checks.

There has been a spike in spending on ads by Democrats that focus on gun control across gubernatorial, Senate and House races, according to USA Today. In 2014, there were 558 pro-gun control spots, mostly from Democrats. In 2018, that number had rocketed to 18,416, in comparison to 8,897 anti-gun control spots by mostly Republicans.

In the House races, pro-gun control ads represented about 67 percent of those with explicit messages on guns, compared to just six percent in 2014.

DEMOCRATS TEST-DRIVE NEW MIDTERM SLOGAN AFTER FIRST ONE IS MOCKED

That has in turn led to some significant about-faces on the issue from long-time lawmakers. The Journal points to Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz. In a 2010 ad, she bragged about her “A” rating from the NRA, but last month she said she would ban “assault weapons” and was given an “F’ by the pro-gun rights group. She said her position changed after the shooting of former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in 2011.

But while the move may rally the Democratic Party base, it may also give the Republican base a boost -- which has repeatedly shown itself more motivated on Second Amendment issues.

The National Republican Congressional Committee suggested that the move was the latest example of the Democratic Party catering to its left-wing base rather than everyday Americans.

“Republican members and candidates are focused on the issues that are important to their respective districts and Democrats are more concerned about appealing to the most radical elements of their party,” an NRCC spokesperson told Fox News.

Gun control is always risky politically for Democrats, who are wary of the political lesson learned from the 90s.

In September 1994 the Democratic-controlled Congress passed an assault weapons ban, which was subsequently signed into law by President Bill Clinton.

Less than two months later the Republicans led by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., took control of both the House and the Senate in what was dubbed the “Revolution of 94.”

But Democrats say that their shift represents the changing mood of the nation after a spate of devastating shootings in recent years.

“2018 could be the first year in which intensity on our side of the issue exceeds intensity on the other side,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told The Journal.

Democrats are likely to be buoyed by the victory of Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., in a March special election -- who won campaigning for background checks in a district Trump won in 2016.

Additionally a WSJ/NBC poll found that Democratic voters rated gun control the second-most important issues after healthcare. For Republicans, guns were fifth. In midterms, where the party which motivates its base can decide who takes control of the chambers in Congress, tapping into those issues could be key.

But it also represents a broader trend in the party of allowing less diversity on certain litmus issues. Last year DNC Chair Tom Perez said that being pro-choice on the subject of abortion was “non-negotiable.”

""Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman’s right to make her own choices about her body and her health. That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state,” he said.",politics

Jairo Bonilla was inside a Managua seminary last spring during a break in Catholic Church-mediated talks to try to end Nicaragua's bloody political crisis when two fellow students approached him with a threat.

""You're going to pay,"" warned one of them, Leonel Morales, the president of the government-backed student union at Nicaragua Polytechnic University, where they both studied. ""Your family is going to cry tears of blood.""

""You know where to find me,"" Bonilla replied.

That was then. Now the 20-year-old, a leader of student protests against President Daniel Ortega's government, is in hiding, trying to ignore the threats that come regularly on Facebook and in menacing text messages. He has survived four months of resistance to Ortega's government, but the student movement he helps lead is now largely underground.

Hundreds of people have been killed in the government's brutal suppression of the months-long protests that erupted in April. More than 2,000 people have been detained as security forces search for those who took part, including about 320 still in custody. Many say they have been abused at the hands of the authorities, including severe beatings and torture. The common refrain of ""We're not scared!"" chanted at the early student marches, is seldom heard any more.

""Ortega achieved his objective,"" Bonilla said in a recent interview, held at a secret location. ""He made us feel fear.""

Chased off their college campuses, the future is uncertain for the students who have stood up to Ortega. Many have fled the country, others are scattered about in safe houses. Some are recovering from bullet wounds they suffered during the government crackdown or struggling with psychological trauma, while Bonilla and other student leaders try to rally the attention of the international community and strategize how to maintain pressure at home.

Bonilla joined the uprising against Ortega's government in mid-April, angered like many of his classmates by the violent government response to protests by retirees angry over cuts in social security benefits. After the marches quickly evolved into a general call for Ortega's ouster and student casualties mounted, Bonilla volunteered to represent his fellow students in the church-mediated talks to try to end the crisis.

That effort was short-lived. In a fiery speech in July, Ortega accused the Roman Catholic bishops organizing the mediation of being ""coup mongers"" seeking his ouster and said they were unqualified to be mediators. The talks have not restarted.

With control of the country's universities and other opposition bastions now firmly in government hands, Ortega, who has been in power since 2007, has vowed to remain in office until at least 2021, when his latest term ends. He has dismissed those who participated in the protests as ""terrorists"" manipulated by outside forces.

These days, Bonilla spends his time holed up in his hideout, trying to prepare for the day when talks with the government might resume. He reads political economy texts, studies negotiation tactics and absorbs as much as he can about Nicaraguan history online. He has changed safe houses twice since June.

Still, Bonilla's situation is better than some.

He is still in Nicaragua and slips out in the open, his face masked by a bandanna, to participate in the sporadic, smaller protest marches that continue despite the arrests and mounting death toll. Other students were locked up for days in a shed or forced to hide at the bottom of a well while government forces searched for them.

There is now a tense calm in Managua, following the violent government crackdown. The stone barricades the students and other government opponents erected at the height of the protests on major highways and outside entire neighborhoods have now been removed by government forces. But there is little activity after nightfall; many restaurants are shuttered and people rush home at dusk, fearful of the masked armed civilians working in coordination with the police who patrol the city's streets.

In the moments when they aren't worried about being discovered or where their next meal will come from, many of those in hiding grow despondent over an unraveling future.

""We want to go on with our normal lives,"" Bonilla said.

One 25-year-old woman, who had been working on a master's degree at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua before she joined the student resistance movement, is already in her second country of exile. Early this month, she fled to Costa Rica, where she had hoped to establish a network of support for those in hiding in Nicaragua. But rumors of government informants among the Nicaraguan exile community there forced her to take off again. Now she is in a third Central American country.

""I don't see my future,"" said the woman, speaking on condition of anonymity because she hopes to return to Nicaragua one day. ""I had planned this year to start classes to finish (the degree), but now I'm directionless.""

Among those in hiding in the Nicaraguan capital is a 20-year-old former student at the national university who lost much of the mobility in his right arm and hand after being shot by security forces on June 23 while helping treat wounded students as they came under fire.

The bullet entered his side and lodged behind his shoulder blade, requiring extensive surgery. He was hospitalized for 11 days and suffered nerve damage, but doctors tell him he could recover with a few months of intensive physical therapy.

Instead he's in a safe house with his 18-year-old brother, who is also in hiding. Both declined to be identified for fear of arrest.

The younger brother said they struggle to sleep, listening to passing traffic and thinking that at any moment they could be discovered.

""All of us who were there in the struggle, they know us,"" he said of the security forces.

""Since the moment that we decided to join the struggle we all knew that a time would come when we would be pursued,"" he said. ""And in case the struggle isn't won and the regime stays in place, I believe that will basically be the end of our lives. Because we won't be able to return to the university, we won't be able to walk in the street.""

Hugo Torres, a guerrilla commander who once fought with Ortega during Nicaragua's 1979 revolution and a retired general with the Nicaraguan army, said it's natural that students who haven't experienced such a struggle before would see a darker and suddenly more complicated future for themselves.

""These struggles have their flows, like the tide, their ebbs,"" said Torres, who broke with Ortega two decades ago and now is vice president of the opposition Sandinista Renovation Movement. There is time to mourn the dead, he said, but that doesn't mean ""your spirit falls or you give up the fight.""

""Nicaragua's history is one of civil wars with small intervals of peace,"" Torres said. ""We're obligated to break this cycle.""

Bonilla agrees.

""We're scared of being massacred, of being arrested, but if that is the price we have to pay, we're going to do it for a free Nicaragua.""",world

"Charles McDaniel Jr. was at home in Indianapolis when his wife told him he had a phone call. To his surprise, he learned that among the 55 boxes believed to hold the remains of U.S. servicemen killed during the Korean War was his dad's dog tag.

“I have to say I didn’t think about the emotions that were very deep even though I was a small boy and have very little memory of my father,"" he said. ""But I sat there and I cried for a while and it took a while to compose myself.”

He and his brother, Larry, finally received their father's dog tag at an emotional ceremony on Wednesday in Washington, D.C.

Charles Jr. said he was just 3 when his father, Master Sgt. Charles Hobert McDaniel, deployed with the First Cavalry Division in Japan around August 1950. After that deployment, Charles Jr. never saw his dad again.

McDaniel said that when news of remains from North Korea began to circulate, he and his family thought that there might be a chance that the lost soldier's might be included -- though they knew they odds were agains them.

Charles Jr., who himself served in the Army as a chaplain, said he didn’t have many memories of his father, though he recalled that he ""liked ice cream but always watched his weight.”

His strongest connections to Dad: the service, and the commitment to their country. McDaniel said his father had a long career in the Army before his Korean War deployment.

“He’s an Army guy,"" he said. ""I’m an Army guy, so I understand that.”

REMAINS RECEIVED FROM NORTH KOREA ‘CONSISTENT’ WITH BEING US SERVICE MEMBERS, PENTAGON SAYS

McDaniel’s younger brother, Larry, who was born at Fort Knox, Ky., in 1948, said he has no memories of his father. He “generates” an idea of what he was like, based on what people have said about him.

""I'm proud that my father was extremely patriotic, loved the country to death that he was able to dedicate his entire life for the country without hesitation,"" he said.

The brothers said they don’t know if any of their father’s remains will be identified but that recovered dog tag has them feeling “most fortunate” already.

The remains sent over from North Korea are ""undergoing forensic analysis"" at a lab in Hawaii; McDaniel’s dog tag was the only one recovered.",world
"History may not repeat itself. But it sure does rhyme.

The war in Iraq wasn’t going well in the fall of 2005 and early 2006. A federal grand jury indicted top White House aide Scooter Libby. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, faced an indictment and was forced to step aside from his leadership post. DeLay aides Tony Rudy and Michael Scanlon encountered criminal charges in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. So did Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio. Ney went to jail. Rep. Duke Cunningham, R-Calif., resigned and did time after pleading guilty to bribery and fraud charges.

But none of that quite sealed the deal for the rival party in the midterms.

Then, word surfaced on the final two days of September 2006, that Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., sent inappropriate text messages to male, teenage House pages. The Foley news erupted in the final hours of Congress trying to wrap up work in Washington and head home to campaign for the midterm elections.

Voters awarded Democrats both the House and Senate that November.

It’s unclear that if in November, we’ll look back at Aug. 21 the same way we viewed the final days of September, some 12 years ago. But the potential is there.

In the span of three hours, a federal jury convicted former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to another set of charges. Then the feds indicted Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., R-Calif., and his wife Margaret Hunter on charges of using campaign funds for personal expenses.

After the Manafort and Cohen stories, one could almost frame the Hunter story in the category, “And in other news ...”

The charges against Hunter have nothing to do with what went down involving Manafort and Cohen. But it’s noteworthy that Hunter was one of President Trump’s earliest and most-enthusiastic supporters in 2015 and early 2016. This is back when there were only a few Republicans on Capitol Hill getting behind the president. Hunter was among them.

This wouldn’t be so interesting if it wasn’t for the fact that authorities also just arrested Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., on insider trading charges two weeks ago. Like Hunter, Collins was one of the president’s other original congressional supporters. The Collins charges aren’t related in any way to Hunter and are in no way linked to anything with Manafort and Cohen.

But, as they did in 2006, people may just look at the chaos and pull the lever the other way.

Collins isn’t seeking re-election. That seat could now be in play because Republicans can’t pry him off the ballot.

Hunter’s attorney Gregory Vega wrote a letter to a favorite GOP whipping boy, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Vega argued that the Justice Department was “rushing to indict Congressman Hunter.” Vega asserted the indictment was “politically motivated” because of Hunter’s early endorsement of President Trump. As a result, Vega contends the indictment means “a solidly Republican district is being handed to a Democratic candidate.”

Hunter’s counsel wasn’t the only one talking Tuesday. So was Cohen’s attorney, Lanny Davis.

“Today he stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election,” said Davis of Cohen. “If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn't they be a crime for Donald Trump?”

Now, let’s step back for a moment.

Storms have churned around Trump for a long time. In 2016, Democrats and pundits thought there was no way he could win. He was coarse. There was the ""Access Hollywood"" tape. You name it. And yet Trump sits in the White House.

In other words, all of the customary issues that could imperil a lot of politicians don’t seem to affect Trump. His approval ratings have even been on the rise of late. There’s chatter about a Democratic “wave” this fall. But no one is really sure.

If we adopt the 2006 model, Republicans are probably toast. Democrats would claim the House -- by a lot -- and maybe even win the Senate. When Democrats earned control of the Senate in 2006, they did so by picking up six seats, marshaling a 51-49 edge. If Democrats have any chance of controlling the Senate this fall, they’ll do it by a seat or two at best.

But, history doesn’t necessarily repeat itself. So, be careful when suggesting that the events of Aug. 21 offer keen insight on the midterm elections.

Yes. Democrats may do great and pick up a bunch of House seats in Pennsylvania and California come November. But there are too many uncertainties about seats in play in Virginia, Texas, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Nevada and Minnesota.

A day like Aug. 21 may yield some clues to the midterms. But not everything.

Lots can still happen.

Somewhere, brewing out there, is an “October Surprise.” Some morsel of information which could tip the midterms one way or the other.

Consider the possibilities:

It’s hurricane season. The devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 contributed to the Republican downfall in 2006.

School is back in session or will be soon. The left organized after last winter’s shooting in Parkland, Fla. Another mass shooting just before midterms could influence voters in November.

The international stage is far from settled. Big issues percolate with Russia, Turkey, Iran, North Korea and Syria. No one can ever rule out an international crisis.

And you just never know what Trump may say or do.

“He'd better not talk about pardons for Michael Cohen or Paul Manafort tonight or any time in the future,” warned Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as the president headed to a campaign rally in West Virginia.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., argued that the “backlash” of pardon talk for Manafort or Cohen “would have Watergate written all over it.”

Still, this isn’t 2006. Or 1974, for that matter. The convergence of things that doomed the Republicans in 2006 may be immaterial this year.

But it sure does rhyme.

"Michael Cohen, the beleaguered former personal attorney for President Trump, has stepped down from his post as deputy finance chair of the Republican National Committee’s Finance Committee amid the ongoing federal investigation into his business dealings.

In a letter to RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel, Cohen cited the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and one by the Southern District of New York as reasons for his resignation. An RNC official confirmed the content of the letter to Fox News.

“This important role requires the full time attention and dedication of each member. Given the ongoing Mueller and SDNY investigations, that simply is impossible for me to do,” he wrote in a letter first reviewed by ABC News. Cohen has been inactive on the committee for several months, the RNC official told Fox News.

Cohen on Tuesday hired New York lawyer Guy Petrillo to represent him in a federal investigation into his business dealings.

Earlier this week, a federal judge denied porn actress Stormy Daniels' request to reconsider delaying her legal fight against Cohen and President Trump.

U.S. District Judge S. James Otero's decision came weeks after Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, argued that the judge should reconsider his order from April delaying the case and force Trump to answer questions under oath and allow him to obtain documents in the lawsuit.

Cohen sought a delay in the case after his home and office were raided by the FBI in April. The agents were seeking records about the nondisclosure agreement that Daniels had signed, among other things. Cohen argued the criminal investigation overlaps with issues in the lawsuit and his right against self-incrimination could be adversely affected because he won't be able to respond and defend himself.",politics
"A couple accused of training children to carry out mass shootings at an ""extremist Muslim"" compound in the New Mexico desert singled out an Atlanta hospital as one target before police arrested them, according to court documents filed Friday.

Prosecutors in Taos County, citing interviews with the 11 children found at the compound earlier this month, claimed in the filing that Jany Leveille wanted to ""confront 'corrupt' institutions or individuals ... and reveal the 'truth' to these corrupt institutions or individuals.""

According to the prosecutors, one of the children said Leveille ""specifically"" mentioned Grady Hospital as a ""corrupt"" institution. They added that Leveille ""expressed her displeasure with Grady Hospital ... due to treatment she and her mother received there.""

The filing also said investigators recovered a 10-page, handwritten document entitled ""Phases of a Terrorist Attack"" from the New Mexico compound. The document includes ""instructions for the one-time terrorist,"" but it was not clear if a specific target was mentioned.

Authorities also said Leveille and her partner, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, ""would laugh and joke about dying in Jihad.""

Prosecutors also outlined allegations that Wahhaj and his 3-year-old son, Abdul-ghani Wahhaj, left Georgia without taking medications the boy needed to treat severe health problems, including seizures that stemmed from a lack of oxygen and blood flow at birth.

The affidavit alleged that Leveille and Wahhaj witnessed the boy's seizures and knew he had a diagnosed seizure disorder but apparently gave him no medication and took no action to seek proper medical care.

Prosecutors quoted an extensive account of the child's death as written in a journal entry they attributed to Leveille, indicating that Abdul-ghani died in late December 2017 as the exhausted boy's heartbeat faded in and out during a religious ritual accompanied by a reading of the Koran and aimed at casting out demonic spirits.

The boy's remains were found Aug. 6 inside an underground tunnel at the compound.

The prosecutors filed the document as part of their appeal of a district judge's order that could allow at least three of the five adult defendants in the case to be released on house arrest with ankle monitors.

Judge Sarah Backus said the previous evidence provided by prosecutors was troubling but did not indicate any clear threat to public safety from the defendants, who have no criminal records. On Friday, prosecutors said that their new evidence proved Leveille ""and possibly others of the defendants may suffer from dangerous delusions ... [and] ... have history of endangering the welfare of children.""

In addition to charges of child neglect against her, Leveille also is being held on accusations by federal immigration authorities that she overstayed her non-immigrant visitor visa after arriving 20 years ago in the United States from her native Haiti. She was returned Thursday to Taos from a federal holding facility in Texas.

"The two Americans killed during an ISIS-claimed terror attack in Tajikistan were Washington, D.C.- area cyclists with a mission to bike across the globe.

Lauren Geoghegan and Jay Austin were among the four foreigners killed when a car rammed into their group south of the Tajik capital of Dushanbe on Sunday. The other victims were from Switzerland and the Netherlands.

Officials said the terrorists rammed into the group in Khatlon Oblast before getting out and attacking them with knives. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, while Tajik officials have pointed to another extremist group in the country.

According to their blog, Geoghegan and Austin began their journey in July 2017 in South Africa. They made their way to Dar es Salam then to Europe. In May, they flew from Istanbul, Turkey to Almaty, the largest city in Kazakhstan.

They last blog post was from July 11 after they cycled from Too Ashuu to Ala-Bel in Kyrgyzstan.

“We coast into a gorgeous green valley. We freewheel past yurts and cows and little Kyrgyz kids and their enthusiastic waves,” Austin wrote. “We pass a French cyclist coming in the other direction, stop to compare notes on roads cycles, and ride on just a little longer.”

Geoghengan’s family released a statement on Tuesday, saying the couple’s yearlong bicycle adventure “was typical of her enthusiastic embrace of life’s opportunities, her openness to new people and places, and her quest for a better understanding of the world.”

“Lauren’s sisters are deeply saddened by the loss of their older sister but treasure their rich memories of her love and of the example she set for them,” the statement continued, according to FOX5 DC. “We want to thank the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, for their capable and compassionate assistance to our family at this difficult time.”

Georghegan was a 29-year-old graduate of Georgetown University, where she majored in government and minored in Spanish and Arabic. She worked at the university’s admissions office.

“We are heartbroken to hear of Lauren's passing in this devastating tragedy and have expressed our deepest condolences to her family. Lauren was a valued colleague and dear friend to many at Georgetown and an overall treasured member of our community,” Georgetown University Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon said in a statement.

Austin worked at Boneyard Studios, a small company building sustainable homes.

“The tiny house world just lost a beautiful soul. Jay Austin, of the former Boneyard Studios, left this world doing what he loved (connecting with people and cycling the world) with the person he loved (Lauren Geoghegan),” the company said in a Facebook statement. “Jay, you didn't only build a house, you built a home for yourself and for so many around you. Thank you for all the beauty and light you brought into this world.”

"The White House is revoking former CIA Director John Brennan's security clearance, press secretary Sarah Sanders said on August 15.

The announcement comes just a few weeks after Sanders said President Trump was considering rescinding security clearances from several former top intelligence officials, including former FBI Director James Comey, who “politicize, and in some cases actually monetize, their public service and their security clearances in making baseless accusations about improper contact with Russia.”

Brennan led the CIA for nearly four years under the Obama administration. Earlier this year, he joined MSNBC and NBC News as a contributor and senior national security and intelligence analyst.

He has been critical of the Trump administration and has called the president “paranoid” and a “charlatan.” He said Trump’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki was “nothing short of treasonous.”

Sanders said Brennan had been ""leveraging"" the clearance to make ""wild outbursts"" and claims against the Trump administration.

Trump himself lumped Brennan in with some “of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington” in a February tweet.

Read on for a look at who else could lose their security clearances.

James Comey

James Comey led the FBI from 2013 until he was abruptly fired in May 2017. Trump, who has repeatedly castigated Comey on Twitter, said he could not “effectively lead” the bureau. The president was highly critical of Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails and the Russia investigation.

Comey was tapped as a U.S. attorney by former President George W. Bush before Obama appointed him to lead the FBI. After he was fired, he wrote a book called, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership.”

Michael Hayden

Gen. Michael Hayden has served during multiple administrations, from leading the National Security Agency under former President Bill Clinton to heading the CIA under both former Presidents Bush and Obama.

Hayden has been an outspoken critic of Trump, especially in his book, “The Assault on Intelligence: American National Security in an Age of Lies.” He also encouraged people not to work for the Trump administration during an interview with Yahoo earlier this year.

HAYDEN RIPS TRUMP’S DECISION-MAKING BUT BACKS CIA NOMINEE HASPEL

Before the announcement, Hayden said revoking his security clearance wouldn’t “have any effect on what I say or write” because he does not attend classified briefings.

Andrew McCabe

FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was fired in March 2018. Trump praised the firing as “a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI” in a tweet, calling McCabe a “choirboy.”

JARED KUSHNER RECEIVES FULL SECURITY CLEARANCE

He was fired just days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension after it was determined he lied to investigators reviewing the bureau’s probe of Clinton’s email server.

Susan Rice

After serving as ambassador to the United Nations, Rice was the National Security Advisor for Obama from 2013 to 2017.

Like others, she was highly critical of Trump’s relationship with Russia and called the July summit with Putin a “historic mistake.” She also blasted Trump earlier this year when he said Obama “allowed Russia to take Crimea.”

"When you hear “world tour” you usually think of superstars performing concerts in various cities for adoring fans. Not so with the presidentially deprived, entitlement-driven Hillary Clinton.

Last week, Hillary Clinton came to Melbourne, Australia’s second largest city, and to Sydney, its largest, with a huge chip on her shoulder. The chip has been there since the 2016 election and seems to be growing larger with every appearance.

As with almost everything else the Clintons do, it cost to hear her bitterness. Those who went to hear Clinton speak, more than 5,000 people, paid between $200 and $500 Australian dollars (about $15 to $380 US). What they heard was criticism of President Trump and his foreign and domestic policies. Not that long ago, Americans made an effort to stop “partisan politics at the water’s edge,” but no more. Especially with some Democratic politicians who seem to believe that government belongs to them and when Republicans win an election it was somehow stolen from its rightful owners.

Interviewed by former liberal Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Hillary Clinton eventually got to what she believes is the real reason she lost to Donald Trump. It was misogynistic men and women who voted the way their husbands told them to that prevented her from making history, or if you prefer, herstory.

Hillary Clinton was at it even before the event began by tweeting that President Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal was a “big mistake” that actually makes the U.S. less safe. As if America would be safer by trusting the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the world to live up to an agreement when Iran’s religious and political leaders regularly speak of their commitment to destroy us (and Israel, too).

In his account of her appearance, Chip Le Grand of The Australian newspaper writes that while Hillary Clinton was “at times disarmingly honest (that seemed to be a first), warm, funny and optimistic,” she also appeared “self-serving and sad.”

What do new contributors to the Clinton Foundation hope to get in return for their donations? More bitterness, perhaps? Very sad.

Like a boxer who doesn’t know when to leave the ring, Hillary Clinton is a two-time political loser who hasn’t gotten the message that she is unlikeable and unelectable. She would do herself and the country (not to mention the Democratic Party) a favor by retiring and leaving the scene of her political accident.

There is still money to be made, however, and to the Clintons money is their catnip.

The Wall Street Journal reported last Friday: “…it’s Clinton fundraising season. This has been true of every season of every year since the late 1970s. But this is a particularly important moment because of a major event that is now less than two weeks away. Last month Axios reported: ‘Longtime Clinton supporters last week received an invitation offering access to the family (the green invitation features photos of Bill, Hillary and Chelsea) at a Clinton Foundation benefit on May 24 in New York, at prices ranging from $2,500 (”Friend”) for cocktail party and dinner, up to $100,000 (”Chair”) for “Leadership Reception for two, a premium table of ten, program recognition as Gala Chair and invitations to the Clinton Foundation Annual Briefing.’”

The now defunct Clinton Global Initiative (which not surprisingly stopped receiving large donations after Hillary Clinton’s defeat) spent a lot of donor money on a large staff, travel and “miscellaneous” expenses. What do new contributors to the Clinton Foundation hope to get in return for their donations? More bitterness, perhaps?

"Claiming that FBI investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and the Carter Page FISA warrant were ""corrupt to the core,"" U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to handle both probes.

Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said FBI investigators were “in the tank” for Clinton and the FISA warrant process was abused -- possibly in a criminal fashion.

“What do you think Democrats would be saying if a Republican — if the RNC [Republican National Committee] -- hired a former British agent to go to Russia to get dirt on [Hillary] Clinton?” Graham asked Fox News' Laura Ingraham, host of “The Ingraham Angle.”

Graham said he's grown tired of talking about the Clinton email investigation and the 2016 FISA warrant to wiretap Page, the former Trump campaign adviser. He said an outside investigator could hopefully approach the issue with a nonpartisan perspective.

TRUMP REVOKES EX-CIA DIRECTOR'S SECURITY CLEARANCE

Democrats have said the FISA warrant application shows the Justice Department acted correctly in its probe. Democrats also point to ex-FBI Director James Comey's decision to announce the reopening of the Clnton email probe just days before the 2016 presidential election as an example of no bias.

Comey has since said that he was operating at the time in a world ""where Hillary Clinton was going to beat Donald Trump.""

Graham's remarks came a day after former FBI agent Peter Strzok was fired over text messages that were critical of Trump.

Strzok vigorously defended himself at a combative House hearing in July, speaking publicly for the first time since the texts were revealed. He insisted that the texts — including ones in which he called Trump a “disaster” and said “We’ll stop” a Trump candidacy — did not reflect political bias and had not affected his investigations.

Strzok was also a lead investigator on the probe into Democrat Clinton’s email server in 2016.

Trump has repeatedly taken aim at Strzok on Twitter, saying his critical text messages showed that Mueller’s investigation is a hoax.

"Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam, on Sunday compared Democratic presidental nomine Hillary Clinton to Hitler over the crime bill that ""put tens of thousands of black brothers and sisters in prison.”

“Mrs. Clinton backed the crime bill and then called our young people super predators,"" the 82-year-old reverend said. ""Of course she apologized, but just a minute. See, Hitler could’ve said to the Jews after Auschwitz, ‘I’m so sorry.’ Would that be enough to satisfy you?”

In April, Hillary Clinton said she was sorry for what she described as the unintended consequences of the landmark 1994 crime bill signed into law by her husband. Clinton's past support for the law has come under fire from some African-Americans, who say that it has contributed to mass incarceration of young blacks.

Farrakhan's disapproval of Clinton did not stop there. He said that, while secretary of state, Clinton influenced President Obama in his decision to distance himself from the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam.

“Barack did not want to denounce me,” he said. “But Hillary forced him. And he gave in.”

Farrakhan did not endorse either candidate during a speech Sunday at the Chicago-based movement's headquarters. He did take swipes at Republican nominee Donald Trump over his tax practices but stayed largely focused on Clinton.

“My friends are going to vote for Mrs. Clinton,” he said. “And I’m not mad at them, they see some value in her because they don’t know who she really is.”

Farrakhan criticized Clinton's judgement as secretary of state and brought up some issues dating back to the 2008 campaign. Apparently citing the popular book ""Game Change,"" he recalled the reported interaction between former President Bill Clinton and then-Sen.Ted Kennedy.

Bill Clinton wanted Kennedy to endorse Hillary over Barack Obama, and reportedly told Kennedy, “A few years ago, this guy would have been getting us coffee.”

After Kennedy endorsed Obama, Clinton reportedly said, “the only reason you are endorsing him is because he’s black. Let’s just be clear.”

Farrakhan has not been a fan of Clinton in the past. He cited mass “black incarceration” and her use of the term “super predators.” He once asked his congregation if anyone was going to cast a ballot for the first woman president and he responded, “I do not blame you for wanting a female president, but that’s a wicked woman.” The congregation applauded.

“She can be sweet,” he said. “But so can you. And you know when you’re sweet and playing a game.”

Farrakhan also criticized Clinton for receiving the Margaret Sanger Award from Planned Parenthood in 2009.

“It was Mrs. Sanger who advocated population control of black and poor people,” Farrakhan said.

“In a 1939 letter, Sanger wrote about getting the black preachers to help with her efforts. She said, ‘we don’t want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.’ … And when Mrs. Clinton received the award, [she said] I admire Margaret Sanger enormously. Her courage. Her tenacity. Her vision.’ Now they have to admit that the war on drugs was a war on black people.”

In September, Farrakhan criticized Obama’s legacy in the White House and what he called Obama’s disinterest in the inner cities, particularly Chicago.",politics
"The leaders of the House judiciary and oversight committees are asking the Department of Justice to turn over documents about the law professor friend of former FBI Director James Comey who last year leaked the contents of Comey’s memos to the media.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., made the request in a letter on Tuesday to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

""The committees are aware James Comey, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), shared or instructed staff to share at least some portion of the memos he drafted memorializing his conversations with President Donald J. Trump (the Comey Memos) to an individual named Daniel Richman,” the letter reads.

COMEY'S MEMO LEAK CONTACT HAD 'SPECIAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE' STATUS AT FBI

Fox News reported last week that Richman, who works at Columbia University, previously worked as a “special government employee” (SGE) for Comey’s FBI on an unpaid basis. The lawmakers say they want more information on that arrangement.

""To assist the committees in their oversight of this matter, please provide a copy of any nondisclosure agreement(s) signed by Richman with FBI, DOJ or any other entity of the federal government,"" Gowdy and Goodlatte write.

Richman emerged last year as the former FBI director’s contact for leaking memos documenting his private discussions with Trump – memos that are now the subject of an inspector general review over the presence of classified material.

Sources familiar with Richman’s status at the FBI told Fox News that he was assigned to ""special projects"" by Comey, and had a security clearance as well as badge access to the building. Richman’s status was the subject of a memorandum of understanding.

While Richman's portfolio included the use of encrypted communications by terror suspects, the sources said he was aksi sent talking points about the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Those talking points attempted to compare and contrast Clinton's use of an unsecured personal server exclusively for government business with the case of retired Gen. David Petraeus, who shared classified information with his biographer and mistress Paula Broadwell, as well as the case brought against the late Sandy Berger.

The former national security adviser under President Clinton pleaded guilty to the unauthorized removal and retention of classified material from the National Archives.

According to the Office of Government Ethics, a special government employee is ""an officer or employee who is retained, designated, appointed or employed to perform temporary duties, with or without compensation, for not more than 130 days during any period of 365 consecutive days.""

"Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, one of the most outspoken members of the anti-Trump ‘resistance’ in Congress, is facing fresh questions about a longstanding controversy regarding how her campaign raises money and how those funds have flowed to her daughter.

The California congresswoman has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars each election cycle from some of her state’s biggest politicians paying to be listed on her slate mailers—sample ballots traditionally mailed out to about 200,000 voters in Los Angeles highlighting whom she supports.

Since 2004, the campaign in turn reportedly has paid $750,000 to the congresswoman’s daughter, Karen Waters, or her public relations firm Progressive Connections for help producing them.

A government watchdog in July filed the first of two complaints with the Federal Election Commission asking for a full audit of the Citizens for Waters campaign.

'Maxine Waters found an old provision and turned it into a cottage industry.' - Tom Anderson, National Legal and Policy Center

The first complaint alleges Waters broke federal campaign finance law, and also names the California Democratic State Central Committee and Sen. Kamala Harris, a likely 2020 Democratic presidential contender.

The conservative National Legal and Policy Center is still drafting a second broader complaint focusing on the sources of money going to the Waters campaign and flowing to her daughter—and the accuracy of campaign finance reports, said Tom Anderson, director of the group’s government integrity project.

Rep. Waters, first elected in 1990, has been in the headlines lately for her calls to impeach President Trump and statements urging public confrontations with his Cabinet officials.

Well before her current political fame, though, she mastered this somewhat-rare form of fundraising in slate mailers. California’s top politicians as well as local office-seekers have given far in excess of legal contribution limits to her campaign to be on her slate of endorsed candidates. The campaign then pays Karen Waters and other firms to produce, print and mail the sample ballots. The FEC approved the practice by Waters in 2004.

“Maxine Waters found an old provision and turned it into a cottage industry,” Anderson told Fox News.

However, the FEC complaint filed on July 25 states that the California Democratic party paid $35,000 to the Waters campaign in 2016 to include the endorsement of Harris’ Senate candidacy on the mailer. The FEC complaint, which cited an October campaign finance report, contends a third party is not legally allowed to pay for the mailer of a candidate without a reimbursement under the 2004 FEC advisory opinion.

A separate report shows that the Harris campaign paid $30,000 to the Waters campaign earlier in 2016 for a primary slate mailer, but no subsequent payments.

“The Democratic State Central Committee of California's $35,000 contribution to Citizens for Waters violated campaign finance limits,” the complaint states.

WATCHDOG SAYS WATERS INCITING 'MOB VIOLENCE'

Neither Waters’ congressional office nor her 2018 campaign responded to phone and email inquiries. Karen Waters also did not respond to phone messages. A California Democratic Party spokesman and Harris’ Senate office did not respond to phone and email inquiries.

The mailers continue to be a lucrative source of funds.

For the 2018 election cycle, FEC data shows, as of July 28, that Democrat Gavin Newsom’s gubernatorial campaign paid $27,000 to Waters’ re-election campaign to be in the mailers.

The state Democratic Party snubbed Sen. Dianne Feinstein this year, but she paid $27,000 and has the Waters endorsement. Candidates for state assembly, sheriff and judges paid between $2,000 and $12,000 to Citizens for Waters to be included on the mailers.

FEC data also shows as of July 28, Citizens for Waters paid Karen Waters $54,000 so far for the 2018 election cycle, mostly for slate mailers but also for other campaign work. The congressional campaign paid her $72,000 in the 2016 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics.

In November, Waters is facing Republican Omar Navarro, 29, a small business owner. The 79-year-old incumbent beat Navarro in 2016 with 76 percent of the vote, and outpaced him again in the June “jungle primary” (in which both parties can run) with 72 percent of the vote.

“She is going to be re-elected no matter what,” Anderson said. “She comes knocking and other politicians in California to say, ‘do you want my endorsement,’ because she knows they don’t want her opposing them.”

Her rising profile in opposing Trump likely gives her more clout, Anderson said.

“If you don’t pay to be on her slate, then maybe you’re one of Trump’s people,” Anderson said. “A local politician, like a judge, does not want to be on her bad side.”

Legally, candidates are paying a reimbursement for the slate mailer, rather than buying an endorsement. But it’s difficult to prove whether the Waters endorsement comes as a result of the payment or if already endorsed candidates are paying for their share, said Adav Noti, a former FEC assistant general counsel.

“Those payments are legitimate if it’s approximate to the cost for the entity producing, printing and sending the mailers,” Noti, now a senior director at the Campaign Legal Center, told Fox News. “Without seeing the information on the cost of the mailers, it’s difficult to say if there is anything inherently wrong with the math.”

Federal law technically limits individual campaign contributions to $2,700 to a candidate’s committee and $5,000 to a political action committee.

“This certainly violates the spirit of campaign finance laws, but the FEC doesn’t seem to think it violates the letter of the law,” said John Wonderlich, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan watchdog group that first reported on the practice by the Waters campaign in 2010 and the connection with her daughter.

“In this case, is it a question of enrichment for a family member?” Wonderlich added. “How much of the money passes through to cover postage and printing? It may be unsavory but not corrupt. Much of it hinges on the extent to which the money passes through.”

The 2004 FEC advisory opinion, signed by Democratic FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, described the slate mailers as follows: “The brochure will feature a prominent picture or likeness of Representative Waters on the front page. It will be promoted as Representative Waters' ‘official sample ballot’ and will contain brief quotes, which convey her opinions and endorsements of the federal and non-federal candidates listed.”

The 2004 FEC opinion states that the payments from other candidates “would not constitute support of, or in-kind contributions to, any federal candidate appearing in the brochure, so long as the authorized committee of that federal candidate reimburses the Waters Committee.”

"Confirmation hearings for President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh begin before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. If Kavanaugh is successfully confirmed it would strengthen our personal liberty and the economy. Why? Because the federal judge is deeply skeptical of the “administrative state” and the penchant for presidents and unelected federal appointees to enact policy, regulate markets and constrain private behavior where Congress has been silent.

For example, President Obama created a whole class of legal rights—pertaining to residency, higher education and employment—for adults brought illegally into the United States as children (DACAs) without legislation.

His Environmental Protection Agency unilaterally set limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and he went far beyond authority in federal statutes and judicial precedents to impose racial preferences in college admissions, and limit the constitutional rights of defendants in campus sexual abuse tribunals.

Often, federal administrative law and liberal judges require a newly-elected president to go through elaborate public hearings and court challenges to repeal such unilateral edicts—consider the obstacles President Trump faces trying to end the DACA program.

Congress cannot write precise rules into statutes—issues are too complex and good policy choices change as market structures and scientific knowledge evolve. For example, the FDA, subject to goals set out in law, determines which drugs are legal for sale and how tightly some medications are controlled.

Judge Kavanaugh’s record reveals a deep suspicion of presidential and government agency overreach.

That is quite another thing from the legislative authority presidents and bureaucrats have arrogated from Congress as a consequence of a 1984 Supreme Court decision involving the EPA and Chevron U.S.A. It states that when a law is unclear the court should defer to a reasonable interpretation by the federal agency applying the law.

Often, legislation requires that many regulatory agency political appointees may not be removed except for reasons of incompetence and corruption. In Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S. (1935), the Supreme Court frustrated President Roosevelt’s effort to remove an FTC commissioner.

President Obama used these precedents and the lower court case law that followed to subvert free markets and democratic accountability—in favor of the statist values and methods of the deep state.

Reflecting the sympathies of the increasingly socialist Democratic Party, he appointed left leaning commissioners and judges to help impose a European-style economic regulatory order and constraints on civil liberties—consider the strict controls on free speech now imposed at many universities.

Practically speaking, most new EU laws require consensus among its 28 member governments—a cumbersome and inadequate process. What has evolved is an administrative state that imposes rules—for example, proclaims all manner of business standards, antitrust policy rules and limits on individual states’ tax policies—all with limited judicial oversight and often with a bias against non-European interests. Ask Amazon and Apple about the treatment they received on tax disputes or the terribly large fines Google must pay on administrative accusations of monopolization.

Judge Kavanaugh’s record reveals a deep suspicion of presidential and government agency overreach. Last year he reviewed FCC net neutrality rules based on the reasoning that internet service providers are public utilities and could not split the internet service into fast and slow lanes.

Though the DC Circuit sided with the FCC, Judge Kavanaugh dissented “Congress never enacted net-neutrality legislation or clearly authorized the FCC to impose common-carrier obligations on Internet service providers.”

In a Harvard Law Review article he wrote “Chevron is nothing more than a judicially orchestrated shift of power from Congress to the Executive Branch,” and he has written some 40 opinions finding federal agencies actions to be unlawful or cursory in its actions.

Similarly, in 2008, he dissented from a D.C. Circuit decision upholding the composition of the Accounting Oversight Board—Sarbanes Oxley required its members could only be removed for cause, not the policies they might impose.

Judge Kavanaugh wrote, “such unaccountable power is inconsistent with liberty,” and in a 5-4 ruling the Supreme Court subsequently embraced his reasoning.

Historically, Americans enjoyed greater protection of their civil liberties from an aggressive state and more robust economic growth than heavily regulated continental Europeans. President Obama and the ascendant socialist wing of the Democratic Party sought to narrow those differences and no surprise, our society grew more restive, divided and less tolerant of individual freedom—and less prosperous.

The true legacy of President Trump will be in the appointment of justices—like Brett Kavanaugh—who reverse the damage, preserve freedom and enable the civic and economic benefits that follow.",politics
"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday resumed her attacks against President Donald Trump, this time criticizing the nation's nearly 18-year high in consumer confidence under the president's leadership.

The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index rose 2.4 points in May, reaching 128 -- for the highest reading in more than 17 years, the organization said this week.

But in her weekly news conference, the California Democrat downplayed the figure, just a week after she claimed low unemployment numbers reported earlier “mean little” to the American people.

'Negative Nancy'

Her recent responses about the economy have prompted Republicans to nickname her “Negative Nancy” over her attempts to downplay positive news.

""(P)eople say, ‘Oh my goodness, ... people are saying the unemployment rate is down, why isn’t my purchasing power increasing?"" Pelosi said. ""So, this isn’t just about the unemployment rate, it’s about wages rising in our country, so that consumer confidence is restored.”

But just as consumer confidence hit its highest point in decades, data revealed last week also showed that the unemployment rate dropped to an 18-year-low of 3.8 percent, with the addition of 223,000 jobs in May, and average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent.

Nevertheless, Pelosi went on to attack the administration and the GOP, saying ""Republicans’ cruel, cynical health care sabotage campaign is already spiking families’ premiums by double digits and pushing millions off their coverage, according to the nonpartisan CBO [Congressional Budget Office].""

She continued her analysis:

""Big Pharma continues to hoard the benefits of the GOP tax scam, using their handouts to further enrich executives and shareholders instead of lowering prescription drug costs for seniors and sick kids. At the same time, the president’s reckless policies are exploding gas prices, wiping out the few meager gains that some families should have received from the GOP tax scam, as wages remain stagnant.""

Critics, left and right

But while Pelosi rails against Trump and company, she is facing increasing criticism both from the right and left of the Democratic Party.

On the left, Pelosi is viewed as too moderate at a time when the party is embracing the socialist politics of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and openly campaigning for some form of socialized medicine and greater government regulation of the economy.

She drew fire after confirming the party will abide by the fiscally conservative pay-as-you-go budget rule if the party regains the majority after November elections. The budget-neutral rule requires tax cuts or increases in spending to be covered by tax increases or cuts in spending.

U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., criticized Pelosi and other Democrats for conceding and promising to adopt the rule.

“The pay-go thing is an absurd idea now given the times and given what’s already been done to curry favor with corporate America,” Grijalva said, according to the Hill.

“It’s a stupid rule. It is entirely counter-productive to progressive policy goals,” wrote Esquire's Charles Pierce. “In case nobody in the Democratic leadership has noticed, the rising energy in the party is not coming out of the budget-hawk cryptkeepers.”

“Right now, the country is giving serious consideration to things like Medicare-for-all and some sort of free college. This isn’t the time to go all Al From again. It also guarantees a serious intraparty skirmish that’s already underway,” he added.

Too anti-Trump?

On the right, red-state Democrats want to see some moderation of her tone when it comes to attacks on Trump, fearing it will hurt their prospects in the midterm elections.

Many candidates also fear GOP’s efforts to use Pelosi’s statements to portray the whole party as out-of-touch and representative of West Coast liberals.

U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., distanced himself from Pelosi during the election last year and said he wouldn’t vote for her remaining the minority leader in the U.S. House. His strategy paid off as he won the special election in a historically GOP district that Trump had won by nearly 20 points.",politics
"The ruling by a three-judge panel that North Carolina’s congressional districts must be redrawn could rock the 2018 midterms – and ultimately leave unclear which party controls the House until next year.

The federal judges found that election advocacy groups and Democrats who brought an initial lawsuit challenging North Carolina's congressional map had standing to do so – and ruled that the maps were unconstitutionally drawn to favor Republicans.

The question is what comes next.

The Supreme Court could be asked to review the decision. But the court is short one member after Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement, and until his replacement is confirmed there is the chance a tie vote would leave the panel’s decision in place.

In its ruling, the panel floated a few options for holding elections with newly drawn districts – including holding a general election as planned without primaries, or holding new primaries during the previously planned November general election and then conducting “a general election sometime before the new Congress is seated in January 2019.""

The latter option could upend expectations for the November midterms.

If the race for control of the House really is as close as some anticipate, it all could come down to North Carolina.

Under the current map, at least a couple of Republican seats are considered in play – the seat held by Rep. Robert Pittenger, who lost his primary, and the seat held by freshman Rep. Ted Budd. But a redrawing of the map could boost Democrats by imperiling more Republican incumbents – including Reps. George Holding, Virginia Foxx, Patrick McHenry and David Rouzer, who flipped a seat that had once belonged to a Democrat.

A major redrawing could put as many as six GOP seats in play. If election night is airtight and the North Carolina general election is pushed back for House races, the public may not know which party controls the House for weeks.

A delay in determining which party controls the House also could impact leadership elections on both sides of the aisle.

North Carolina’s election maps have long been the subject of controversy and court challenge.

In Monday's ruling, U.S. Circuit Court Judge James Wynn wrote that North Carolina's General Assembly ""expressly directed"" the lawmakers and consultants responsible for crafting the congressional district map ""to rely on 'political data' — that is, past election results specifying whether, and to what extent, particular voting precincts had favored Republican or Democratic candidates, and therefore were likely to do so in the future — to draw a districting plan that would ensure Republican candidates would prevail in the vast majority of the State’s congressional districts, and would continue to do so in future elections.""

Currently, North Carolina is represented by 10 Republicans and three Democrats in the House of Representatives.

"The father of a 3-year-old British boy, who suffered serious burns to his face in arm in an apparent acid attack, has been charged in the incident and was due in court Tuesday along with five other men.

The man, 39, who wasn’t identified, and five others were charged with conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm after the substance was thrown on the child inside a Home Bargains store in July.

Adam Cech, 27, Jan Dudi, 25, Norbert Pulko, 22, Saied Hussini, 41, and Jabar Paktia, 41, were among those charged in the Worcester attack, according to Sky News.

The child was discharged from the hospital days after suffering the burns, but police said the long-term prognosis of his injuries is not yet known.

The use of corrosive liquids, which leave victims gruesomely disfigured with life-altering injuries, has grown in popularity the last few years.

In Britain, the number of reported attacks using acid rose from 262 in 2015 to 454 in 2016. In 2017, there were more than 500 acid attacks reported across the region.

British police have reported seeing an increase in acid attacks during the last year, but it is very rare for a victim to be so young. Some attacks are related to gang fights or late-night bar confrontations.

Robin Walker, the Worcester representative in Parliament, said lawmakers are considering toughening sentences for people convicted of any type of intentional assault with acid.

He described what happened to the 3-year-old boy as “horrific.”

"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired back at President Trump on Wednesday, saying the president should focus on other matters instead of badmouthing his city.

The mayor was quick to allude to Trump's mounting legal troubles one day after the president assailed Chicago's crime rate and immigration policies at a Tuesday night rally in West Virginia.

“First of all, we'll always be a welcoming city, because Chicago welcomed my grandfather, etc. But let me just say one thing, if I were Donald Trump, I’d spend my time figuring out which attorney I’m going to have,” Emanuel told Fox 32 Chicago.

One night earlier, Trump took jabs at Chicago's status as a high-crime city that also served as a sanctuary for immigrants.

""Take a look at Chicago. How about the mayor of Chicago? It's like a war zone. This is what those policies do,"" Trump said at the rally.

Chicago is known to have the some of the nation's most violent neighborhoods, with nearly 60 people shot and four people killed last weekend alone, Fox News reported.

But a researcher told Fox 32 that violence in the city's ""war zones"" is ""virtually all carried out by native-born Americans"" rather than immigrants.

Emanuel, meanwhile, was apparently preaching to the Democratic choir: A new survey showed that 70 percent of Cook County residents have an unfavorable view of Trump, the station reported.

Trump and Emanuel have a history of trading barbs.

In July, after Trump's Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Emanuel called for Trump's security clearance to be taken away, the Chicago Tribune reported.

“I don’t know if I’ve ever thought this, but I did yesterday: Can you actually take away a president’s security clearance, since they shouldn’t be getting intel from the intel community?” Emanuel said, criticizing Trump's performance at the summit. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Amid Chicago's crime problems, Emanuel faces building pressure to take action or resign, the report said.

He also reportedly came under fire for comments that linked the city's violence to the moral character of people in some ethnic neighborhoods.",politics
"During a visit to Ireland, fired FBI Director James Comey said Friday that he was so ashamed of current U.S. immigration policies that he considered telling Irish customs officials that he was Canadian when he arrived.

Comey made the remark during a public interview in Dublin, the Irish Times reported.

“I am ashamed of the way my country has acted with respect of those children. I am disgusted, I am horrified, I am embarrassed, I’m ashamed,” he said.

Comey, who is on a promotional tour for his book, ""A Higher Loyalty,"" arrived in Ireland with his wife this week.

""My wife and I were joking, not really joking; we wanted to tell the people on the customs line coming here that we were Canadian. And we were joking but it’s funny because it reveals a truth: I’m ashamed."" - Former FBI Director James Comey

“My wife and I were joking, not really joking; we wanted to tell the people on the customs line coming here that we were Canadian. And we were joking but it’s funny because it reveals a truth: I’m ashamed,” he said.

Comey blamed the U.S.-Mexico border crisis -- in which scores of children were separated from their parents until President Donald Trump issued an executive order changing the policy -- on political and economic conditions in Central America.

A day earlier, in an interview with the Guardian, Comey likened the detention centers for immigrants arriving in the U.S. to the Japanese internment camps during World II and the civil rights struggles of the 1960s.

Comey also told the Dublin crowd that his decision to reopen a case on Hillary Clinton’s alleged mishandling of emails just 11 days before the November 2016 presidential election was not motivated by politics. It was a decision many have blamed for her loss.

The former FBI director also reiterated his criticism of President Trump, whom he said is “morally unqualified for office.”

Comey ended by expressing confidence that the country’s “democratic institutions” will withstand any political fervors.

“The rule of law is spine,” he said. “No president serves long enough to screw that up. Donald Trump, even if he were competent, he could not screw that up.”",politics
"President Trump’s decision to revoke the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan on Wednesday is the latest move in what’s been an ongoing rift between the pair.

The announcement, made by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on behalf of the president, accused Brennan of “leveraging” his clearance to make “wild outbursts” and claims against the Trump administration in the media.

In response to the decision, Brennan tweeted that his ""principles are worth far more than clearances. I will not relent.""

As recently as Tuesday evening, Brennan, who has been critical of Trump’s conduct, described him as being “the most divisive president we’ve ever had in the oval office.”

In an interview on MSNBC Brennan was asked about his wording in an earlier tweet, particularly on why he thought Trump’s behavior was dangerous.

TRUMP REVOKES SECURITY CLEARANCE FOR FORMER CIA DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN

“I think Donald Trump has badly sullied the reputation of the office of the presidency. With his invective, with his constant disregard, I think, for human decency, as well as his befriending of autocratic leaders around the world. And his continued pursuit of relationships to benefit himself, as opposed to the country,” Brennan said. “I do think that America’s standing in the world has also been tarnished. What I think even more fundamentally, what he is doing here in the United States is very polarizing and he is, I think, the most divisive president we’ve ever had in the oval office.”

Brennan joined NBC News and MSNBC in February as a contributor and senior national security and intelligence analyst.

The former intelligence official also tweeted Monday, reacting to the president’s tweet saying he’s aware “it’s ‘not presidential’ to take on a lowlife"" like former White House adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman, who has been on a controversial book tour slamming the administration.

“You’re absolutely right,” Brennan tweeted. “If you were ‘presidential,’ you would focus on healing the rifts within our Nation, being truthful about the challenges we face, & showing the world that America is still that shining beacon of freedom, liberty, prosperity, & goodness that welcomes all.""

RAND PAUL CALLS TO REVOKE JOHN BRENNAN’S SECURITY CLEARANCE, ASKS IF HE’S ‘MONETIZING’ ACCESS

Brennan specifically took issue last month with Trump’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The former intelligence official labeled the summit as “nothing short of treasonous.”

“Donald Trump’s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of ‘high crimes & misdemeanors,’” Brennan tweeted on July 16. “It was nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump’s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???”

In an interview with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson that aired the following day, Trump denied being “pro-Russia” and slammed Brennan as being “a very bad person.”

“I think Brennan is a very bad guy and, if you look at it, a lot of things happened under his watch,” Trump told Carlson. “I think he's a very bad person.”

The president also compared Brennan to FBI official Peter Strzok, former FBI attorney Lisa Page, former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

""When you watch all of the things that have happened ... you look at the deception, the lies,"" Trump said in the interview. ""These are people that in my opinion are truly bad people, and they’re being exposed for what they are.”

TRUMP SAYS ‘I’M NOT PRO-RUSSIA,’ HITS EX-CIA CHIEF BRENNAN FOR CALLING PUTIN NEWS CONFERENCE ‘TREASONOUS’

The rift between Brennan and the president existed before the latter even took office.

President-elect Trump slammed the outgoing CIA director on Jan. 15, 2017 after Brennan said Trump didn’t have a “full understanding” of Russia’s power and threat to the world.

He also suggested that Trump lacked a “full appreciation” of Russia’s aggression or understanding about why President Obama imposed sanctions on the Kremlin for meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Trump responded with two tweets that criticized the CIA’s record under Brennan and questioned whether he had leaked a dossier of controversial unverified allegations about Trump.

"Liberal Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, fresh off his upset victory in Florida’s gubernatorial primary, is being showered with praise from big Democratic socialists like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – all eager for an epic ideological clash in the race against Trump-backed GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis.

But back home in Florida, Gillum is grappling with a controversy that could distract from this political war of ideas: the ongoing FBI investigation into possible corruption in Tallahassee, the city he has led since 2014.

Gillum has denied wrongdoing and said the FBI has told him he is not a focus of the investigation.

But Republicans, in the aftermath of Gillum’s primary win, are doing everything they can to draw attention to Gillum’s link to the probe and make sure it casts a shadow over his campaign.

“He is embroiled in a lot of corruption scandals,” Gillum’s Republican opponent DeSantis, who won the GOP nomination for governor Tuesday, said on Fox News. “This guy can't even run the city of Tallahassee. There is no way Florida voters can entrust him with our entire state.”

“With Andrew Gillum, Florida Democrats have selected a radical far-left politician who remains at the center of an FBI anti-corruption investigation,” the Republican Governors Association said Tuesday.

The candidate downplayed the investigation during television appearances.

“I don’t expect any trouble my way….I welcome their investigation to get to the bottom of any corruption that might exist,” Gillum said on Fox News' ""Shepard Smith Reporting.""

Gillum told CNN he ""pushed that issue past us in this primary.""

""We’re going to remain focused on the issues that confront everyday Floridians,” he said.

TRUMP-ENDORSED RON DESANTIS TO FACE BERNIE-BACKED ANDREW GILLUM IN FLORIDA GOVERNOR’S RACE

According to local news outlets – which have extensively covered the case – the FBI has been investigating potential corruption related to land deals in the city. Last year, the FBI issued subpoenas for documents from the city of Tallahassee related to developers.

Gillum in 2016 also interacted with an undercover FBI agent who was posing as a businessman interested in investing in Tallahassee, according to those reports. He was introduced to that agent by lobbyist Adam Corey, a longtime friend who has since been subpoenaed as part the probe.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, Gillum scheduled a meeting with the undercover FBI agent while on a Costa Rica vacation with Corey in 2016.

A spokesman for the FBI Jacksonville Division declined to comment.

Before Tuesday, former Rep. Gwen Graham, the daughter of former Florida Governor and Sen. Bob Graham, led in pre-election polls.

But Gillum had been generating excitement among the base all year, prompting a Tampa Bay Times report in February to note how ""remarkable"" this was considering some in the party establishment had written him off amid the corruption probe.

In the end, Gillum finished at the top of the crowded field of Democrats, winning 3 percentage points more of the vote than Graham.

In the Republican primary, President Trump threw his support months ago behind DeSantis, who defeated state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam in the Republican gubernatorial primary. In a tweet Wednesday, Trump accused Gillum of allowing “crime” and “many other problems” to flourish in Tallahassee:

""Not only did Congressman Ron DeSantis easily win the Republican Primary, but his opponent in November is his biggest dream....a failed Socialist Mayor named Andrew Gillum who has allowed crime & many other problems to flourish in his city. This is not what Florida wants or needs!""

But on the first day of the general election race, DeSantis had problems of his own -- and was forced to clarify comments he made earlier Wednesday in which he warned voters not to “monkey this up” by voting for his Democratic opponent.

The remark drew instant fire from Democrats, who accused him of using “racist dog whistles,” considering Gillum would be the state's first black governor.

But DeSantis’ campaign dismissed claims that his remarks had a racial dimension as “absurd.”

“Ron DeSantis was obviously talking about Florida not making the wrong decision to embrace the socialist policies that Andrew Gillum espouses,” spokesman Stephen Lawson said in a statement. “To characterize it as anything else is absurd.”

"The Trump campaign has filed a formal complaint against Omarosa Manigault Newman saying she breached a confidentiality agreement signed in 2016, in response to her newly released book and promotional tour.

“Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. has filed an arbitration against Omarosa Manigault Newman, with the American Arbitration Association in New York City, for breach of her 2016 confidentiality agreement with the Trump Campaign,” a Trump campaign official told Fox News in a statement on Tuesday.

The move comes as the reality TV star's explosive tell-all memoir is released, detailing her time at the White House and with the 2016 campaign.

In the book and in promotional interviews, she has trashed her former colleagues and President Trump himself.

But the question of whether she violated any confidentiality agreement has hung over the tour.

In her book, she claimed that she “refused” to sign a non-disclosure agreement upon her exit from the Trump White House. But on Monday, Trump tweeted that “Wacky Omarosa already has a fully signed Non-Disclosure Agreement!”

This may have been a reference to one signed when joining the campaign.

The Washington Examiner reportedly obtained a sample of the agreement, which would require her to keep information about the president, his companies and his family confidential, and not “disparage” the Trump family “during the term of your service and at all times thereafter.”

It's unclear whether such an agreement would apply to disclosures about events and conversations after the campaign, however.

The American Arbitration Association declined to comment when asked by Fox News about the complaint.

In her book, “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House,” released Tuesday, Manigault Newman aims to settle countless scores, blasting Trump, depicting tensions inside the first family and mocking her former campaign and White House colleagues.

Manigault-Newman also accuses Trump in the book of being “racist” and a “misogynist,” and of being “mentally and physically impaired.”

Manigault Newman accuses Trump, whom she calls her “mentor” throughout the book, of expecting “moblike” loyalty, likening him to a “cult leader.”

“Loyalty is a loaded topic when it comes to Donald Trump. His moblike loyalty requirements are exacting, imperishable, and sometimes unethical (as in James Comey’s case.),” she writes. “But for the people in Trumpworld, loyalty to him is an absolute and unyielding necessity, akin to followers’ devotion to a cult leader.”

She alleges: “Trumpworld is a cult of personality focused solely on Donald J. Trump.”

Trump has blasted Manigault Newman, calling her “wacky” and a “crazed, crying lowlife.” And on Tuesday, Trump praised his chief of staff John Kelly for “firing that dog!”

The president also blasted her as “vicious, but not smart” and said “people in the White House hated her.”

She has drawn tough criticism from the White House after she revealed secretly taped recordings of her conversation with Kelly in the White House Situation Room during her termination, and said that Kelly was “threatening” her.

She also revealed she taped a phone conversation with Trump after she was fired.

Manigault Newman, meanwhile, claimed that she believed her firing was related to her knowledge of a tape made in the early 2000s, in which Trump supposedly uses “the N-word.”

Petanque players in Paris who helped in the apprehension of a knife-wielding man have been lauded Monday for their bravery as French authorities opened a murder investigation into the attacks that saw seven people injured.

According to police, witnesses at the scene of Sunday night's attacks in the northeast 19th district helped disarm and arrest the man near a cinema in a recreational area populated by both Parisians and tourists.

Some of those playing boules, also known as petanque, saw what was going on and threw their heavy metallic balls at the attacker — with one hitting his head — before plain-clothes policemen arrested the man.

On Twitter, French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb praised the ""courage and reactivity"" of those who intervened.

A judicial official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to discuss publicly an ongoing investigation, said the attacker was believed to be an Afghan national. He said terrorist motives were not suspected at this stage.

Paris police said four of the victims were in serious condition, including one in a life-threatening condition. Two British tourists were among those injured.

""The judicial investigation will determine the circumstances"", Collomb said.

Boudjema Hamani told The Associated Press he was playing petanque with two friends when they saw people running and shouting ""be careful, he has a knife!""

Hamani and his friends ran after the attacker and threw their petanque balls as he was trying to stab people in the street.

At one point another man, Reda Smain, managed to take the 40-centimeter (15-inch) knife away from the attacker.

They pushed the man on the ground and overpowered him until police came a few minutes later, Hamani said.

""Of course it's scary. We are human beings, we're not Superman so if we're stabbed we're going to die ... But we didn't have time to think about it. We had the (petanque) balls with us, so we had a weapon, like him,"" Hamani said.

Smain told French network BFMTV that he struck the attacker's left arm, which was holding the knife.

""I jumped on the knife, took him from his hand,"" he said. ""Then I fell with him and knocked him out.""

"Two European bicyclists found dead in a ravine in southern Mexico were robbed and murdered, authorities say, despite earlier claims they plunged to their deaths in an accident.

Prosecutor Luis Alberto Sanchez said the bodies of Krzystof Chmielewski, of Poland, and Holger Hagenbusch, of Germany, were found at the bottom of a cliff in Chiapas state, the BBC reported.

Chmielewski, 37, was shot in the head and found on April 26 about 130 feet below the road he’d been traveling on. Hagenbusch, 43, likely died from a head wound sustained during a beating and wasn’t discovered until May 4.

The announcement, on Friday, was the latest report to shock the crime-ridden country.

BODY OF MISSING GERMAN CYCLIST BELIEVED FOUND IN MEXICO

Last month, Mexican rapper Christian Omar Palma Gutierrez’ confessed to dissolving the bodies of three film students in acid at the behest of a drug cartel. On April 27, about 12,000 people gathered in Guadalajara to protest the murders of the three and the rise in crime.

Most of the victims have been young people. At least 15,516 people between the ages of 13 and 29 are officially missing.

Violent cartel-related murders continue to spike in the nation, which saw over 25,000 killings in 2017, setting an all time record.

In the case of the bike riders, authorities initially blamed the victims, saying they lost control and fell off the cliff. They also claimed there were no signs of foul play.

But after Hagenbusch’s brother went to Mexico to identify his sibling’s body, he learned Chmielewski “was decapitated and had a foot missing,” according to his Facebook post.

"A Republican congressman touched off a firestorm Tuesday after claiming on Twitter that his office had information suggesting the FBI leaked information to the press and used the resulting articles to help obtain surveillance warrants.

""We've learned NEW information suggesting our suspicions are true: FBI/DOJ have previously leaked info to the press, and then used those same press stories as a separate source to justify FISA's,"" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., tweeted overnight.

The claim stemmed in part from FBI intelligence analyst Jonathan Moffa’s Friday testimony behind closed doors before the House Judiciary and Oversight committees.

A source with knowledge of the testimony backed up Meadows, telling Fox News that Moffa said FBI personnel would use media reports based on information they leaked to justify applications for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants.

The source told Fox News that Moffa, who worked with controversial former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, acknowledged this “had been a practice in the past.”

Republicans have long questioned to what extent leaked information, related to the unverified anti-Trump dossier, was used as a basis for surveillance warrants against former Trump adviser Carter Page in 2016 -- when the bureau was led by James Comey and deputy Andrew McCabe.

The source told Fox News that Moffa did not specifically confirm whether leaking was employed with regard to the dossier, but said the FBI had done this in other cases.

A government official, however, pushed back, saying that the account was incorrect and that Maffa did not testify to this.

And another source familiar with Moffa’s testimony offered a more nuanced version of events. The source told Fox News that Moffa said the FBI keeps track of open source reports related to their cases -- and when asked whether a FISA application would reference a news account, he said it could be possible, hypothetically, but the FBI aims to find better information.

The source stressed that this was not related to any specific situation and that Moffa did not suggest this was a common practice at the FBI.

Meadows, though, largely stood by his claims – but offered a clarification in a Tuesday afternoon statement to Fox News, drawing a distinction between what Moffa testified and what his office has learned from other materials.

“Jonathan Moffa made it clear to the committee the FBI routinely uses media reports to corroborate analytic work product. We have emails and texts plainly showing the FBI leaks to the media, raising major red flags. If FBI executives want the American people to believe they haven’t used leaks to their advantage, they are not being honest,” Meadows said in the statement, while saying this includes FISA materials.

Meadows also told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom” earlier Tuesday that the committee had evidence of the FBI’s practice that would be “hard to refute.”

“We know that some people at the Department of Justice and the FBI actually gave information to the media, then the stories were reported. Then they used those reports to justify further investigations,” Meadows said. “You know, that’s like saying, we’re going to incriminate on one hand, and be the jury on the other. It just doesn’t work that way.”

The Daily Caller first reported on the specifics of Moffa's claims.

The Trump dossier, which contained salacious allegations about the then-presidential candidate, was compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele. Steele, who was also working as an FBI source, had been hired by research firm Fusion GPS to compile details for the dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee.

One source familiar with Moffa's testimony told Fox News that his statements raise concerns that the bureau indeed used this practice with the dossier, referencing an article written by Yahoo! News’ Michael Isikoff.

The Isikoff article was published on Sept. 23, 2016, focusing on Page’s July 2016 trip to Moscow. According to a House GOP memoearlier this year, the Isikoff article did “not corroborate the Steele dossier” as the article was “derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News.” Yet the subsequent FISA application to spy on Page cited the Isikoff article, among other pieces of evidence.

“The [Carter] Page FISA application incorrectly assesses that Steele did not properly provide information to Yahoo News,” the memo read. “Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News—and several other outlets—in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS.”

Moffa served on the FBI’s “Mid-Year Exam,” the code name for the bureau’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information and use of a private email server while secretary of state.

Moffa’s name often appeared in text message conversations between former FBI officials Strzok and Page, who came under scrutiny for their anti-Trump and politically charged exchanges. One text message exchange between the two on July 24, 2016 discussed their need to read “Moffa’s thing,” referencing an FBI “302”—which is an interview or witness deposition in an FBI investigation.

DOCUMENTS SUGGEST POSSIBLE COORDINATION BETWEEN CIA, FBI, OBAMA WH AND DEM OFFICIALS EARLY IN TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE: INVESTIGATORS

Another reference was on Aug. 8, 2016.

“Hey no update yet, waiting on Moffa, he’s in with Dina at mtg scheduled to end at 11,” Strzok texted Page. An hour later, he added: “Hey, talked to him, will let him fill you in. Internal joint cyber cd Intel piece for D, scenesetter for McDonough brief, Trainor [head of FBI cyber division] directed all cyber info be pulled. I’d let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would be best for D to have it before the Wed WH session.”

In the texts, “D” referred to former FBI Director James Comey, and “McDonough” referred to former chief of staff for former President Barack Obama, Denis McDonough, according to GOP investigators.

Page left the bureau in May, and Strzok was fired earlier this month.

On Tuesday, House lawmakers have the chance to question Justice Department senior official Bruce Ohr on the same FBI practice, as Ohr testifies behind closed doors.

Ohr had frequent contact with Steele before and after the publication of the dossier, and the FBI’s ultimate decision to cut ties with the ex-British spy. Ohr’s wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS at the time of the creation of the dossier.",politics
"In 2008, she was chosen to be his running mate – potentially just a heartbeat away from the presidency.

But now former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, like President Trump, has been left off the list of invitees to the funeral of the late U.S. Sen. John McCain, according to multiple reports.

“My guess is, it came from Cindy,” a source close to the McCain family told People magazine, referring to the late senator’s widow. “She is very protective of John’s memory and legacy. She’s also a grieving widow. I think she wants to get through this as best she can.”

“My guess is, it came from Cindy. She is very protective of John’s memory and legacy. She’s also a grieving widow. I think she wants to get through this as best she can.” - Source close to the McCain family, to People magazine

The message was sent through an intermediary, not directly from the McCain family, according to the report.

An NBC reporter tweeted that a Palin ""family source"" said, “Out of respect to Senator McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point. The Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear.”

Palin did not immediately respond to a Fox News email sent early Thursday.

A decade ago, it was McCain’s selection of Palin to be his vice president that catapulted Palin to the national political spotlight from relative obscurity in Alaska.

But their relationship quickly grew strained, amid accusations that Palin was often unprepared for media interviews, or had “gone rogue” by ignoring the advice of McCain campaign handlers.

Some critics charged that Palin was more interested in advancing her own career – and popularity among conservative voters -- than assuring the success of the McCain-Palin ticket, led by the more moderate McCain.

In May, McCain published a book titled “The Restless Wave,” in which he wrote that he regretted choosing Palin as his running mate instead of his close friend, former U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut.

McCain and Palin ultimately lost the White House in 2008 to Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

Ironically, Biden is scheduled to speak Thursday at a McCain memorial service in the senator’s home state of Arizona, while Obama has been invited to deliver a eulogy Saturday at a McCain memorial service in Washington, D.C.

Following McCain’s death from brain cancer last Saturday at age 81, Palin issued a pair of Twitter messages.

“Today we lost an American original,” she wrote. “Sen. John McCain was a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs. John never took the easy path in life - and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self.”

Later, she wrote: “John McCain was my friend. I will remember the good times. My family and I send prayers for Cindy and the McCain family.”",politics
"Ahead of the planned announcement of President Trump’s Supreme Court nomination, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order to protect abortion and contraceptive coverage in the state.

Since Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement, giving Trump the ability to select his second Supreme Court justice in his first term as president, Democrats have publicly expressed concern that the nation’s highest court, with the addition of a conservative judge, could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision that legalized abortion.

Flanked by women holding signs in support of Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, Cuomo on Monday said Trump plans to roll back Roe v. Wade as part of his plan to “make America great again” and “take us back to the dark days ... before women had the constitutional legal protection to control their own bodies.”

He derided the Supreme Court as a “rubber stamp for the president.”

“Mark my words, they are moving to roll back Roe v. Wade. That is going to be the next move by this president,” Cuomo, a Democrat, said.

Without providing many details, Cuomo signed an executive order that he said “protects a woman’s right to choose, protects a woman’s right to contraceptive care – no insurance company can deny it, no bureaucracy can deny it and no federal agency can deny it.”

His order updates a Department of Financial Services regulation to expand coverage of contraceptive drugs and devices and allow women to fill up to 12 months of a prescribed contraceptive at one time, according to a news release. It ensures ""that women in New York who are insured through individual, small group and large group comprehensive health insurance policies as well as Medicaid receive insurance coverage without cost-sharing for contraceptive services.""

Cuomo signed a similar order in January 2017 that ensured in New York “contraceptive drugs and devices are covered by commercial health insurance policies without co-pays, coinsurance or deductibles regardless of the future of the Affordable Care Act.”

Monday's directive codified the 2017 guidance ""regarding information that must be provided in formularies regarding contraceptives, including noting which contraceptives are covered without cost-sharing,"" the governor's office said.

TRUMP’S SUPREME COURT PICK NEEDS SENATE APPROVAL: A LOOK AT THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS

Cuomo also called on the state Senate to hold a special session to pass legislation that would codify Roe v. Wade in New York before the next Supreme Court justice is confirmed. As the Albany Times Union reported, the Republican-controlled state Senate has blocked efforts to pass the Reproductive Health Act (RHA) in the past.

At the campaign-style event Monday, Cuomo said, “God told me I was a feminist when he gave me three daughters.” He blasted the “extreme conservative philosophy in Washington that is trying to take over the country.”

“The federal government … has shown total disrespect to women. The disrespect they show is personal, it’s professional and it is governmental,” Cuomo said, adding the government has “done nothing” with the Me Too movement.

Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging Cuomo in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in September, said Cuomo’s efforts are too late.

“You shouldn’t only govern and fight like a Democrat right before the Democrat primary; you should do it after the election too,” Nixon, an actress, said earlier Monday, according to the New York Daily News.

SUPREME COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF PRO-LIFE CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS

With the announcement planned for Monday night, Trump has already decided who will be his Supreme Court nominee, a source has told Fox News. He’s thought to be deciding between four judges: Amy Coney Barrett, Thomas Hardiman, Brett Kavanaugh and Raymond Kethledge.

In 2016, Trump pledged he would be “putting pro-life justices on the court.”

Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Main and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have said they support abortion rights and will be looking for assurances from the nominee that Roe v. Wade will not be overturned.

Both women are being targeted by a liberal group over their vote. However, in 2017 they both voted to confirm Gorsuch, who was confirmed 54-45.

State fire officials said Thursday that the Carr Fire is surrounded. However, firefighters will continue to patrol the area for several days and crews are still working on repairing broken fences and other damage caused by firefighters.

The blaze charred nearly 360 square miles (929 square kilometers) in and around Redding, making it the seventh largest in California history.

"A Missouri woman who traveled to Australia last August to visit a man she met online was caught smuggling cocaine -- inside the heels of her shoes, officials said.

Denise Marie Woodrum, 51, was busted while going through customs at the Sydney Airport on Aug. 4 last year. She was stopped by officers who discovered two pounds of cocaine in her luggage, the Sydney Morning Herald reported Monday.

Woodrum, who is a lay associate with the Catholic order Adorers of the Blood of Christ, claims she was duped by a man named Hendrick Cornelius and that the items in her luggage were meant for him.

“She was groomed to provide financial gain for this person, Hendrick Cornelius, whatever person or persons it was behind this identity,” her lawyer Rebecca Neil said in court last week, the newspaper reported. “She went on this trip, she was bringing artifacts for him.”

A spokesperson for the Adorers of the Blood of Christ told Fox News on Wednesday that Woodrum was known to them for at least five years and that she was not a nun or a sister with the order, as previously reported.

Cheryl Wittenauer, communications director for the Adorers of the Blood of Christ in St. Louis, said a lay associate with the order is someone who is inspired by the spirituality of a particular order and seeks to follow it in their private life. She said Woodrum once considered becoming a nun, but decided against it.

According to Woodrum, she had crippling debt due to major health problems and a failed marriage. She thought the man she met online was someone special.

However, despite exchanging hundreds of text with this mystery man, Woodrum never met him face to face. Her lawyer claims the 51-year-old was a “vulnerable” woman who had been preyed on.

In January, Woodrum pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug. However, Judge Penelope Wass has questioned Woodrum’s explanation, saying it’s “inconsistent and at times unbelievable.”

According to court documents, Woodrum flew from Missouri to Texas and then to Trinidad and Tobago on July 18, 2017. From there she traveled to the Suriname capital city of Paramaribo.

On July 30 – still in the South American country – Woodrum reportedly texted Cornelius: “Riding in his car to get stuff no signature needed.” That same day she traveled back to the U.S. via Trinidad and Tobago.

On August 2, she texted Cornelius a list of expenses and departed to Sydney from Miami via Los Angeles.

“It’s been a pleasure serving together…” Woodrum reportedly texted after landing.

Stopped at the Sydney airport, Woodrum reportedly told officers she traveled to the Australian city to see the Harbour Bridge and the aquarium. She said the shoes in her suitcase were a gift for her mother.

A substance was reportedly detected inside the heel of a shoe, a wallet and buttons on clothing.

After the shoes tested positive for cocaine, Woodrum reportedly replied: “Why, how much did you find?”

She later told investigators she’d been given gifts and clothes in South America to give to people in Sydney.

All the while, Cornelius was reportedly sending her messages that read: “Are you OK?” “What are you doing honey?” “Shuttle?” “In taxi?”

Woodrum has remained in custody since her arrest and is due to be sentenced early next month.

Meanwhile, Woodrum’s father told the Fairfax Media that his daughter’s arrest was a “big shock to the whole family.”

“It just came out of the blue,” Tom Rozanski, who lives in Illinois, added.

He said his daughter was a former teacher with a master’s degree in marketing, who suffered from depression and had undergone a hysterectomy.

“All of a sudden she met someone she talked to,” Rozanski said. “She said she was going to be doing some traveling.”

He added: “Life took a turn. She has never done anything like this before, and this experience has been difficult for me to understand. Mostly because none of our family has had anything happen to them that even remotely resembles what Denise has done.""

"He has the appetite of a human, but apparently the brain of a chicken.

A suspected burglar of a fried chicken joint in England is being mocked on social media after police had to use the Jaws of Life to remove him after he got stuck in one of the restaurant’s ventilation shafts.

"Dozens of illegal immigrants were discovered stashed away in the back of a tractor-trailer in Texas last week, according to authorities.

The semi transporting 76 immigrants was stopped on Friday at a checkpoint on U.S. 83, north of Laredo in South Texas, U.S. Border patrol said in a statement on Monday. The driver of the vehicle, who authorities say is now in custody, was questioned about his immigration status and it was determined he is a U.S. citizen.

Authorities found the immigrants inside the trailer while the rig underwent further inspection. The vehicle has been seized.

The immigrants are from Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala and they are all in good health, according to the Border Patrol. Thirteen of them were unaccompanied children.

Laredo Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Gabriel Acosta called the incident a “blatant disregard for human life” that “will not be tolerated.”

“These criminal organizations view these individuals as mere commodities without regard for their safety,” Acosta said in a statement. “The blatant disregard for human life will not be tolerated. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to disrupt and dismantle these organizations and prosecute those responsible.”

"More Iranians are paying big money to buy passports in neighboring countries through bribery or fraudulent information, in a bid to evade U.S. sanctions and the Trump administration's travel ban on Iran and six other nations, multiple sources have told Fox News.

The Iranians are getting passports from a number of nations, sources said. But Iran's influence with some elements of the Iraqi goverment is now so prominent the issuing of passports through payoffs and corruption there has become a growing concern, Iraqi and other sources told Fox News.

“It means that Iranians aren’t then flagged as being from a country barred by the United States,” one Iraqi insider told Fox News. ""Mostly, it has been used by business people and merchants wanting to get around the economic sanctions and continue doing business with the West.”

One longtime Iraq-based, Western security expert stressed the Iranian influence inside Iraq has become “significantly heightened” since the ISIS onslaught, along with the establishment of a “Shia corridor” that enables unprecedented access – from Tehran through Baghdad, onto Damascus and then Beirut, posing a direct threat to Israel’s security.

Several counter-terrorism specialists in the U.S. also affirmed that security concerns over the passport issue have been heightened in recent months.

“It is going on, and it is not difficult to do – especially if you have a friendly government helping you out,” noted a former intelligence official currently working as a counter-terrorism consultant in the Middle East. “Iran has many allies in high-level positions in Baghdad.”

Sources also believe the passport issue may be a factor in the assassination of three Iraqi officials in just the last three months. The director of a provincial Iraqi Citizenship Department, Col. Amer Qasem Mohammed, and his aide, Lt. Col. Shaker Mahmoud were killed on Wednesday afternoon by gunmen on the road between Diyalah, near the Iranian border, and Baghdad.

And in late June, Col. Safa Hassan al-Dulaimi – the head of the directorate of passports in the southern Iraqi province of Babil – was assassinated in broad daylight on his way home. Several Iraq sources claimed the motive behind the assassination stemmed from his refusal to issue forged Iraqi passports to the powers behind the Iranian-backed militias.

Long-running international sanctions against Iran were lifted following the 2015 signing of the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). But President Trump in May pulled the United States out of the controversial agreement, prompting the U.S. Treasury to institute new sanctions against money transfer services, some state-operated airlines, as well as individuals aligned with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and missile program.

A full slate of U.S sanctions will be reimposed by November.

The Iranian government does not officially permit its country’s citizens to hold a second passport. But intelligence bureaucrats are known to allow select business figures to carry other passports for ease of travel, and doing business abroad.

Several Iraqi officials denied the notion of a fraudulent passport operation.

“Iraqi passports are issued with a high security standard and it is impossible to make forged passports through the institutes or through the officers who issue them. We get the eye cornea prints and fingerprints, we guarantee high security,” General Saad Maan Al Mousawi, a spokesperson for Iraq’s Ministry of the Interior, told Fox News. “But I say it is possible to fake the passports after they have been issued, if someone lost their passport or it was stolen, it could be forged. But not through legal ways.”

US WITHDRAWAL FROM IRAN DEAL HELPING WIND DOWN YEMEN WAR, OFFICIALS SAY

EXILED AFGHAN LEADER, AND ONE-TIME U.S. ALLY, WARNS AGAINST ""PEACE"" WITH TALIBAN FROM POSITION OF WEAKNESS

Another high-ranking ministry official, who requested not to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media, also insisted Iraq has not issued fraudulently passports for Iranian nationals. He said that if Iranians who could legitimately claim Iraqi citizenships want a passport, they must first obtain Iraqi national documents “which is not easy, is a long procedure, and requires the father to be Iraqi.”

But Iraq isn't the only neighboring country doling out passports to Iranians.

According to one Afghan government official, the problem is most evident in the border province of Herat, where national identification cards can be easily purchased on the black market, or through unscrupulous channels, thus making it significantly easier to obtain a passport under false pretenses.

One Kabul authority said Iranians have been known to pay between $5,000 and $10,000 to acquire all the needed documents – beginning with a national identification card – which then allows them to apply for a second passport.

While both the Iraqi and Afghanistan passports have little value on the internationally recognized Henley index of travel freedom, both ranking close to the bottom, their holders are not on the U.S. travel ban list. Moreover, in the latest available Corruptions Perceptions Index, unveiled in February, Iraq ranked as the 169th most corrupt country out of 180, while Afghanistan fell almost at the bottom, standing at 177.

Representatives for Iranian and Afghanistan governments did not respond to a request for comment.

“The proliferation of forged documents enables a host of illegal activities, like the travel of sanctioned or wanted individuals and other forms of illegal immigration. It is also a deliberate attack on the authority to secure its borders,” said David Ibsen, Executive Director of the not-for-profit, non-partisan policy organization Counter Extremism Project (CEP). “This is not surprising, as Iran will do what it can to circumvent sanctions.”

And the problem isn't contained in neighboring countries like Iraq and Afghanistan.

A Reuters investigation published in June revealed the Comoros Islands, a small nation off the east coast of Africa, suddenly had to cancel the passports “purchased” by more than 100 Iranians –including those of senior executives in industries all targeted by international sanctions.

The legitimate purchase of a passport in some countries is legal, and traditionally tied to individuals agreeing to invest a certain amount of money to boost small economies. This so-called “citizenship by investment” has been used by Iranians in a number of countries.

“Diplomats and security sources in the Comoros and the West are concerned that some Iranians acquired the passports to protect their interests as sanctions crimped Iran’s ability to conduct international business,” the Reuters report stated. “While none of the people or companies involved faced sanctions, the restrictions on Iran could still make a second passport helpful. Comoros passports offer visa-free travel in parts of the Middle and Far East and could be used by Iranians to open accounts in foreign banks and register companies abroad.”

Iranians are also among the largest national groups to be buying up passports as part of the Citizenship by Investment program for the Commonwealth of Dominica, as well as the island of Grenada. Passports from those countries allow visa-free travel to more than 100 countries.

This is not a new problem, some experts told Fox News.

A July 2013 congressional hearing on homeland security documented “the acquisition by hundreds and perhaps thousands of Iranian nationals of legitimate, original passports, codulas, and other national identity documents from Ecuador, Panama, Venezuela and Bolivia” had been granted largely to operatives in the Quds Force, Ministry of Intelligence and other intelligence services in Iran who can then “move across the region relatively undetected because they are no longer identifiable as Iranians.”

Recommendations at the time were made to “focus on the thousands of passports” that had been issued by these countries to Iranians, given the “vast bulk of people receiving these passports by complicit governments” were not tourists but agents “whose primary objective is to find vulnerabilities and points of entry into the United States, identify vulnerable targets in the region and prepare a military response if Iran’s nuclear program were to be attacked.”

The small Caribbean island of St. Kitts and Nevis drew the indignation of the U.S. Treasury Department in late 2014 after three suspected Iranian operatives were seized using St. Kitts passports to launder money at the behest of banks in Tehran, in violation of U.S. sanctions.

Furthermore, more than 5,000 passports then had to be annulled as they did not have listed a birthplace or were awarded to individuals who had changed their names.

The island did make a formal announcement in 2011 that going forward, Iranian investors would be suspended from participation in the citizenship by investment program, citing the “unfolding events coming from the international community” and re-asserting its own position as a “country friendly to all, and an enemy to none.”

But Iranians living abroad were, according to National Interest, were still applying for the citizenship in droves.

In August this year, Citizenship by Investment Unit (CIU) of Saint Lucia suddenly announced Iranians were no longer eligible for the program, saying they were “unable to undertake due diligence checks on site in Iran and validate documents issued from Iran.” No mention was made of second citizenships already issued.

“We know that much of the international Islamist terrorism is being directed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (ICRG). If entrants can acquire a passport from an ESTA eligible country, then they could more easily gain entry to the U.S,"" noted Tom Wilson, Research Fellow in the Center on Radicalization and Terrorism at the Henry Jackson Society, referring to the “Electronic System for Travel Authorization,” which facilitates visa waivers to the U.S.

“Iranians who hold second passports may well be able to buy property in the U.S, or do business with ordinary Americans,"" Wilson said. ""In particular is the concern that key Iranian figures will use these passports to try and avoid the full effects of sanctions.”

One British-based lawyer – a leader in facilitating legitimate pathways for people to procure second nationalities through investment – told Fox News that since Trump took office, and made clear the Iran nuke deal was in jeopardy, there has been a sharp pullback in taking on Iranian cases.

“It’s not worth the hassle,” the lawyer said.

A spokesperson for the U.S State Department insisted national security remains the top priority when adjudicating visa applications.

“Every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes extensive security screening. Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats,” the representative insisted.

“We are constantly working to find mechanisms to improve our screening process, allow travel and immigration to the United States while protecting U.S citizens and excluding individuals who might pose a threat.”

But security experts emphasized that while U.S technology and screening is top-notch, it is not unassailable.

“As long as the demand is there, criminals will find a way,” said Larry Johnson, former Secret Service agent and now CEO of CyberSponse. “In the meantime, the United States Government has to remain vigilant.”",world

An octogenarian couple in Peru has received the skeletal remains of their son from authorities more than three decades after he was taken away by soldiers during the darkest days of the Andean nation's fight with Maoist rebels.

The return was part of a renewed effort by Peru to bring closure to families of the more than 20,000 people forcibly disappeared during the armed conflict.

Maximo Cueto and his wife Gregoria spent the better part of their savings and retirement from a prosperous business raising livestock in the southern Andes looking for their son, Cesareo, ever since he was forcibly taken from his university dormitory one night in 1984. Their search took them as far away as the Amazon rain forest and a former island penitentiary off the coast of Lima used for political prisoners in the 1980s.

Gregoria, 88, even composed a song in the native Quechua language to express the family's grief at not knowing the fate of their son.

""It was an obsession,"" said Elder Chipana, the couple's grandson and nephew of Cesareo.

Between 2008 and 2012, a team of forensic experts carried out thousands of excavations in a 7-hectare plot next to a military barrack in Huamanga that was the site of one of the most horrific crimes committed by the military in its bloody conflict with Shining Path rebels that terrorized much of the countryside in the 1980s and 1990s. There they found the remains of 109 individuals. Many of the bones were burned in a stove used by the military to dispose of bodies and hide any evidence of torture.

Twice before the family thought it had found Cesareo among the victims due to familiar-looking clothing that was found with the remains only to have DNA tests come back negative. Then, in July, they learned that a pile of bones with scrapes on the right knee and marks on the teeth indicating past dental work was their son, said archaeologist Luis Rueda, head of the team behind the excavations.

Authorities hope that in the future thousands of Peruvian families who have spent decades wondering about loved ones who disappeared during the conflict won't have to wait as long for closure. This month, for the first time, the remains of 14 people were turned over to loved ones under a new law that seeks to streamline the lengthy and burdensome process to identify those killed in the conflict.

Under the measure, authorities can turn over remains uncovered by forensic scientists before determining a cause of death or completing an investigation. Families are also no longer required to file a complaint with the chief prosecutor's office first.

For the Cueto family, who persevered in the face of the bureaucratic hurdles, the new law is a welcome change.

Last Saturday, they finally bid farewell to their son in a family mausoleum in Huamanga. A small band played popular Andean music as his maroon-colored coffin was paraded through the city that for years was the setting for a solitary battle they hope other families won't ever have to repeat.

"Dozens of MS-13 gang members and affiliates have been hit with charges following a murder and drug trafficking probe, an official in California said.

Two MS-13 gang members were charged with murder in U.S. court and another four with assault. Another 16 people affiliated with MS-13 are facing drug trafficking charges. Additional charges have been filed in state court.

The street gang reportedly terrorized the city of Mendota by taking advantage of an understaffed police department, Sacramento U.S. Attorney McGregor Scott told The Associated Press on Thursday.

WHAT IS MS-13, THE VIOLENT GANG TRUMP VOWED TO TARGET?

Mendota, with a population of roughly 11,000 people, lies 35 miles west of Fresno in California's agriculturally rich Central Valley. Nearly the entire population is Hispanic, with many immigrants from El Salvador.

The probe, according to Scott, also helped solve assaults and killings in Houston, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and New York. A wiretap obtained as part of the probe linked MS-13 gang members to slayings and assaults in those cities, leading to additional people being charged there.

""The nationwide tentacles of this going out from this little town in Fresno County is dramatic,"" he said.

"President Trump on Tuesday said that the U.S. will secure the southern border with the military until a wall can be built, calling the move a “big step.”

Trump made the remarks during a meeting with Baltic leaders, where he said he had discussed the matter with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. A White House official revealed later Tuesday to Fox News that the plan considered by Trump would be a “substantial” mobilization of the National Guard.

“Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military,” he said. “That's a big step, we really haven’t done that before, or certainly not very much before.”

At a news conference later, he confirmed the plan, saying the border is unprotected by “our horrible, horrible and very unsafe laws.”

“We don't have laws, we have catch-and-release,” he said. “You catch and then you immediately release and people come back years later for a court case, except they virtually never come back.”

Trump did not offer specifics, but the move appears to be at least partly motivated by a caravan of over 1,000 Central American migrants heading toward the U.S. border. Buzzfeed, which first reported on the caravan, said that Mexican officials had not yet attempted to stop the flow.

In Tuesday's discussion, Trump and senior officials “also agreed on the need to pressure Congress to urgently pass legislation to close legal loopholes exploited by criminal trafficking, narco-terrorist and smuggling organizations,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. She added that Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten Nielsen, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford and Chief of Staff John Kelly were among the other officials present.

Reports of the caravan angered Trump, who has sent out a number of tweets threatening to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and to cut foreign aid to countries such as Honduras, from where many of the migrants originate.



“The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our “Weak Laws” Border, had better be stopped before it gets there,” he tweeted Tuesday. “Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!”

At the press conference he said that NAFTA was an “embarrasing” deal and that he had told Mexican officials on Monday: “I hope you're going to tell that caravan not to get up to the border.” He added that he thinks the caravan was being broken up as a result.

The Pentagon was scrambling to come up with a response to Trump's statement on the military guarding the border. But according to a memo obtained by Fox News and discussions with officials, one area where the Pentagon could contribute immediately is the Air Force’s Barry Goldwater live-fire range, which shares a 35-mile border with Mexico in southern Arizona.

The Defense Department is already offering some support to the border, including U.S. Navy ships patrolling waters to seize drugs as well as missions involving over 100 personnel from U.S. military’s northern command -- including eight planes and a drone -- to help border patrol.

In 2010, President Obama authorized 1,200 National Guard troops to increase security at the border, although Republican lawmakers questioned their role and whether they would in fact be “boots on the ground.""



Trump has struggled to secure funding for his central campaign promise of a wall, which the administration and border officials say will cost approximately $20-25 billion. In the omnibus bill signed by Trump last month, $1.6 billion was included for technology and some replacement of existing border fencing -- although it excluded the prototypes Trump recently viewed in California.



Trump briefly considered vetoing the legislation both over its lack of funding for the wall and also the failure to include a fix for the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that granted protection for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children. He has since floated the idea of getting the Pentagon to fund the wall.

Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council, said on Fox News Radio’s “The Todd Starnes Show” that it gives Border Patrol “certainty of apprehension.”

“The criminal smugglers, this is a multibillion dollar industry. They smuggle humans, they smuggle drugs,” he said. “This criminal enterprise, if we arrest the majority of people that cross the border illegally, we put a dent into their criminal enterprise, and if you put a dent into their criminal enterprise, then you can possibly stop them.”

""We express our willingness to sit down face-to-face with the U.S. and resolve issues anytime and in any format,"" North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the outlet, citing the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

Trump’s move to call off the June 12 talks in Singapore highlights the tension between the two countries and further emphasizes the need of a meeting, the official reportedly explained. He added that Kim has been prepping for the summit.

""Our commitment to doing our best for the sake of peace and stability for the world and the Korean Peninsula remains unchanged, and we are open-minded in giving time and opportunity to the U.S.,"" he said.

Word from the hermit kingdom came hours after Trump penned a letter to the dictator saying that talks right now would be “inappropriate” considering “the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” in recent comments from North Korea.

“Therefore, please let this letter serve to represent that the Singapore summit, for the good of both parties, but to the detriment of the world, will not take place,” Trump wrote.

North Korea on Thursday threatened to back away from the meeting.

Vice Minister of the North Korean Foreign Ministry, Choe Son Hui, said in a statement that whether the U.S. “will meet with us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and behavior of the United States,” according to Yonhap News.

The official also reportedly insulted Vice President Pence after he said North Korea had initially asked for the meeting.

""The tremendous anger and open hostility that President Trump mentioned is just a backlash in response to a unilateral denuclearization being pushed ahead of the planned North-U.S summit,"" the official said Friday, according to Yonhap.

Trump closed out his letter to Kim saying that “if you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write.”

“The world, and North Korea in particular, has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity and wealth,” Trump wrote. “This missed opportunity is a truly sad moment in history.”

"President Bashar al-Assad has approved a gas attack in the Idlib province, which is the country’s last rebel stronghold, a report on Sunday said.

Reports of Assad's approval comes about a week after President Trump warned the strongman and his allies not to “recklessly attack” the province. Trump called any gas attack a potential “grave humanitarian mistake.”

The Wall Street Journal, citing U.S. officials, was first to report on Assad.

U.N. officials believe an offensive on Idlib would trigger a wave of displacement that could uproot an estimated 800,000 people and discourage refugees from returning home. The U.S. and France have warned an Idlib offensive would trigger a humanitarian crisis and warned that a chemical attack in Idlib would prompt a western retaliation.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the international pressure did little to sway Assad, who benefits from support from Russia and Iran. The report said Assad has approved the use of chlorine gas.

For Russia and Iran, both allies of the Syrian government, retaking Idlib is crucial to complete what they see as a military victory in Syria’s civil war after Syrian troops recaptured nearly all other major towns and cities, largely defeating the rebellion against Assad.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday urged his counterparts to accept a cease-fire and avert a “bloodbath” in Idlib. But Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a “total annihilation of terrorists in Syria,” while Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke of “cleansing the Idlib region of terrorists.”

On Sunday, government forces bombed the village of Hobeit in Idlib province, killing an infant girl and wounding several other civilians, the Syrian Civil Defense search-and-rescue group reported.

“We haven’t said that the U.S. would use the military in response to an offensive,” one senior administration official told the paper. “We have political tools at our disposal, we have economic tools at our disposal. There are a number of different ways we could respond if Assad were to take that reckless, dangerous step.”

"Election ballots should be printed in English only, a Republican running to be Arizona's next secretary of state said last weekend in a comment that drew pushback from both sides of the aisle.

Candidate Steve Gaynor's remarks came during a GOP candidate forum in Wickenburg last Saturday, the Arizona Republic reported.

""My printing plant in L.A. printed an information pamphlet not too long ago. It had 18 languages on it,"" Gaynor, the owner of a printing business in Southern California, said, according to the paper. ""I would be the first to say it should be -- ballots, information pamphlets, all the material in our country -- should be in English.""

""My printing plant in L.A. printed an information pamphlet not too long ago. It had 18 languages on it."" - Steve Gaynor, GOP candidate for Arizona secretary of state

Many in the crowd booed, the report said.

Incumbent Secretary of State Michele Reagan, who is among Gaynor's opponents in the state's GOP primary Aug. 28, accused Gaynor of ""pandering"" to far right-wing groups, the Republic reported.

Another candidate for secretary of state, state Sen. Katie Hobbs, D-Phoenix, said Gaynor's remarks were worrisome, the report said.

Maggie Acosta, lead canvasser for a progressive voter advocacy group, told the Republic that Spanish-language materials were crucial in Arizona because many of the state's voters who speak and read English still prefer to cast a ballot in their first language, to make sure they cast their votes correctly.

“A lot of the people are willing to (vote), yet they are afraid that they’re going to make a mistake on something,"" Acosta said. ""They get discouraged and they’d just rather not vote.""

The federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 requires that some districts provide election materials in other languages for minority citizen groups who speak different languages, according to the report.

“A lot of the people are willing to (vote), yet they are afraid that they’re going to make a mistake on something. ... They get discouraged and they’d just rather not vote."" - Maggie Acosta, leader canvasser

Based on U.S. Census data demographics, 10 of Arizona's 15 counties must provide voting materials in languages other than English, the Republic reported. About 900,000 Arizona voters are eligible to receive translated ballots under the law, the report said, citing Census data.

Gaynor said the counties should be able to decide if they want to print materials in Spanish.

He added that learning English would help immigrants ""assimilate into American society,"" the Republic reported.

"The last known Nazi collaborator living in the United States -- a 95-year-old former camp guard who played an ""indispensable role"" in the murders of thousands of Jews -- was deported to Germany from his New York City home early Tuesday morning, completing what the U.S. ambassador to Germany called a ""difficult task.""

Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador who arrived in Germany earlier this year after political maneuvering by Democrats held up his nomination for months, told ""FOX & friends"" in an exclusive interview that President Trump — who is from New York — instructed him to make the removal of Jakiw Palij a priority. Grenell said the new German government, which took office in March, brought ""new energy"" to the matter.

""It's really a credit to President Trump, who was very clear about this case, made clear he wanted this individual out of the United States,"" Grenell said, later adding, ""it's a great day for the United States to have this man out of our country.""

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Tuesday implemented a deportation order against Palij that dated to 2004. But kicking out Palij, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1949 and became a citizen in 1957 after concealing his Nazi background, was no easy task.

Grenell said the deportation came after months of diplomatic negotiations, and was ""difficult"" because Palij is not a German citizen and was stateless after losing his citizenship in the U.S.

""[Germany] had a moral obligation, not necessarily a legal one, because he worked in the name of the then-German government,"" he told ""FOX & friends.""

The ambassador praised Germany's new foreign and interior ministers who both ""wanted to work with President Trump to make this happen."" He also said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was ""aggressive"" about the case.

Palij admitted to Department of Justice officials in 2003 that he trained at a Nazi camp in German-occupied Poland. Court documents indicated that men who trained at the SS Training camp in Trawniki carried out the Nazi regime’s plan to murder Jews in Poland.

The 95-year-old also served as an armed guard at the adjacent Trawniki Labor Camp – where he played an “indispensable role” in the death of roughly 6,000 Jews who were killed in one of the single largest massacres of the Holocaust in 1943, according to the statement.

Palij, who claimed he was working on a farm and in a factory during World War II, had his U.S. citizenship revoked in 2003 by a federal judge, and ordered to be deported a year later. His appeal was denied in 2005.

After the war, Palij maintained friendships with other Nazi guards who the government says came to the U.S. under similar false pretenses. And in an interesting coincidence, Palij and his wife purchased their Queens home near LaGuardia Airport in 1966 from a Polish Jewish couple who had survived the Holocaust and were not aware of his past.

“Through extensive negotiations, President Trump and his team secured Palij’s deportation to Germany and advanced the United States’ collaborative efforts with a key European ally,” the statement read.

The State Department later issued a statement saying Germany has re-admitted Palij. As for what will happen to Palij in Germany, Grenell said ""it's in the hands of the Germans"" to figure out what to do with him next.

""The fact is we have a president who really wants to fight for the American people, make sure that the rule of law is followed,"" he told ""FOX & friends.""

In a special ceremony at the White House on Monday, Trump honored two agencies -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection -- however, as ABC News noted Palij was not mentioned.

"The chaotic start to Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing was coordinated from the top by Democratic senators who wanted to stall the Supreme Court nomination process amid complaints about access to documents.

Kavanaugh returns before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday for the start of formal questioning. He has delivered only his opening statement so far, vowing Tuesday to be a “neutral and impartial arbiter” after enduring a morning and afternoon of blistering statements from Democrats warning about the implications of his potential confirmation. Many of those Democrats repeatedly tried to object, delay and even adjourn the hearing amid requests for more documents and more time to review the files they had.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., seemed to acknowledge the show was coordinated when asked by GOP Sen. Thom Tillis during Tuesday’s hearing to respond to reports that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a phone call over the holiday weekend discussing protest plans.

Durbin said “there was a phone conference yesterday,” where “many issues were raised.”

He said this included concerns that “over 100,000 documents related to Judge Kavanaugh had been characterized by the chairman of the committee as committee confidential” and questions of whether the committee should hear the nominee “without access to basic information about his public record.”

Politico, citing unnamed sources, reported that Democrats discussed going even further than their strategy of rapid-fire disruptions. According to the report, they considered staging a mass walkout during the confirmation hearing.

But the party’s top lawmakers ultimately decided against such a course of action, in part fearing the backlash from a made-for-TV moment would only help the Republican Party, and impede any chances to stop the nomination of Kavanaugh, the report said.

The consideration of such a drastic move revealed a split between the party’s more liberal wing, who wish to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh by all means necessary, and more senior Democrats, who believe the nomination should be defeated only by following rules and norms.

The Democrats ultimately came to a compromise – a disruptive and chaotic hearing, Politico reported.

Younger Democrats, such as California Sen. Kamala Harris, hijacked Tuesday’s hearing almost as soon as it started and urged the committee to delay the hearing amid protests by liberal activists, some of whom were arrested.

Harris received praise for her defiance of the chamber’s norms. “This was a big step forward, and Kamala Harris showed real leadership by going first in interrupting the hearing. Now we need other Democrats who aren't on the committee to speak up and oppose this nominee, too,” Brian Fallon, director of Demand Justice, an anti-Kavanaugh group, told the outlet.

By not staging a walkout, however, Democrats also allowed themselves to become part of the process and grill Kavanaugh in the upcoming hearings, hoping to mobilize opposition to his candidacy.

The obstructionist tactics, which will surely boost some lawmakers’ reputations among the increasingly liberal base, may still backfire when it comes to the confirmation of Kavanaugh.

Democrats ultimately need to convince moderate Republicans to vote against Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of the swing votes that could stop the nomination, dismissed Tuesday’s protests as “a lot of drama,” according to the outlet.

Meanwhile, another viral moment from Tuesday’s hearing – when Fred Guttenberg, father of Jaime Guttenberg who was killed in the Parkland shooting, was seen approaching Kavanaugh for a handshake, only for the nominee to walk away – also was the result of some planning.

The committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, tweeted that she invited Guttenberg to sit in the audience.

“He knows firsthand how Brett Kavanaugh’s extreme views on guns could lead to more massacres,” tweeted Feinstein, who has long championed gun control measures.

But Guttenberg said it was his decision to approach Kavanaugh.

“I initiated an effort to introduce myself to Kavanaugh. It was my decison and I own it. Anyone trying to come up with some politial master plan is simply wrong,” he tweeted.",politics
"An Indonesian shaman was arrested Sunday for allegedly keeping a young girl hidden in a cave for 15 years and tricking her into having sex with him, police said.

Tolitoli police rescued the woman, who was only identified as HS, and who was trapped in a crevice between large rocks near Galumpang village, the Jakarta Post reported. Police saved the woman after they received a report she was being held captive by an 83-year-old witch doctor named Jago.

“We found the victim in a gap between rocks,” Tolitoli police Chief Muhammad Iqbal Alqudusy told the Jakarta Post, adding police suspect Jago was keeping the woman as his sex slave.

The man showed HS a picture of a boy named Amrin “who she thought was her boyfriend,” Iqbal said.

“She was led to believe that Amrin’s spirit had entered (the elderly man’s) body,” Iqbal said at a news conference Tuesday. “It is obvious that he was satisfying his lust.”

The man reportedly told HS the spirit was guarding the hole to stop her from leaving the cave.

The woman believed she was having sex with “Jin Amrin” since 2003 when she was really having sex with the shaman, Iqbal told Reuters.

The woman’s sister was married to the shaman’s son, according to the Jakarta Post. The shaman had been known for his healing methods and his so-called abilities to channel spirits.

The shaman reportedly told the victim’s parents in 2003 she had gone to Jakarta to find work.

Jago faces charges under Indonesia’s child protection laws. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 15 years in prison.",world
"A federal judge praised the Trump administration Friday for its efforts to reunite families separated at the nation's southern border, calling it “a collaborative process that’s well underway.”

U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw said at a hearing that the administration has demonstrated “good faith” after largely complying with orders to reunite migrant families with children under five years old.

The administration was ordered to reunite all children by Tuesday but failed to do so by the deadline. The American Civil Liberties Union requested that the government be penalized but did not address the matter at the hearing, according to a USA Today report.

The administration disputed that characterization, saying it had reunified all 58 children under 5 who were eligible and that it complied with the judge's order.

It acknowledged that 19 of the 58 children were reunified Wednesday, and one on Thursday — after the deadline — ""for logistical reasons specific to each case.""

The administration initially provided a list of about 100 kids under 5 who were believed eligible for reunification by this week's deadline but whittled down the list to fewer than 60 by Thursday.

It said parents of 11 children were excluded for their criminal histories and that seven turned out not to be parents. Others were determined to be a danger to the child.

Sabraw ordered the administration to provide a list of names of the remaining parents in immigration custody and their children by Monday and complete background checks for them by Thursday in order to meet the final deadline of July 26.

He also ordered that the information be handed over to the ACLU in advance of the reunifications.

"The Navy's first female admiral, retired Rear Adm. Alene B. Duerk, died Saturday at the age of 98, the service branch announced Wednesday.

Duerk, born in Defiance, Ohio, in 1920, joined the Navy as an ensign in 1941 after completing nursing training at the Toledo Hospital School of Nursing in Ohio, the Navy said in a news release.

""Alene Duerk was a strong and dedicated trail blazer who embodied the very principles that continue to guide Navy Medicine today,"" Vice Adm. Forrest Faison, Navy surgeon general, said in a statement. ""She will forever be remembered as a servant leader who provided the best care to those who defended our nation, honoring the uniform we wear and the privilege of leadership.""

The Navy said her first tours of duty during World War 2 included ward nurse at Naval Hospital Portsmouth in Virginia, Naval Hospital Bethesda in Maryland, and board the Navy hospital ship U.S.S. Benevolence in 1945. While aboard the Benevolence, Duerk helped attend to the sick and wounded being brought back from the Third Fleet's operations against Japan.

At the end of World War 2, Duerk was involved with the repatriation of liberated allied prisoners of war, according to the Navy.

""The time I was aboard the hospital ship and we took the prisoners of war, that was something I will never forget,"" Duerk told the Library of Congress' Veteran's History Project. ""That was the most exciting experience of my whole career.""

ARMY VETERAN WOUNDED IN IED BLAST SURPRISED WITH MORTGAGE-FREE HOME IN TEXAS

After being released from active service in 1946, Duerk returned in 1951 as a nursing instructor at the Naval Hospital Corps School in Portsmouth, Va. and as inter-service education coordinator at the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.

She then served at hospitals over the next two decades in San Diego, Yokosuka, Japan, Chicago, and in Washington D.C. In May 1970, she was appointed as appointed director of the Navy Nurse Corps and helped expand Navy's sphere of nursing into ambulatory care, anesthesia, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology.

President Richard Nixon approved her selection to the rank of rear admiral on April 26, 1972, making her the first woman to be selected for a flag rank. Duerk retired in 1975, but remained a strong advocate for nursing throughout her life, according to the Navy.

""It took 197 years and a forward-looking Chief of Naval Operations, Elmo Zumwalt, to break with tradition before Alene Duerk became the first woman admiral in the U.S. Navy,"" Naval History and Heritage Command director Sam Cox said in a statement. ""But the credit goes to Duerk. From the crucible of caring for wounded Sailors, Marines and prisoners of war during World War II in the Pacific, she blazed a trail of stellar performance in tough jobs, serving as an inspiration for an ever increasing number of women officers who have followed her path.""",world
"Over the last six months, we have seen a government shut-down, much debate, multiple legal challenges, and countless protests over whether the federal government should extend legal status to the Dreamers – the 690,000 people who were brought to our country illegally as children who are currently enrolled in President Obama’s controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

Throughout this debate over the DACA Dreamers, however, almost no attention has been paid to another group of Dreamers – a group that is here legally yet still faces the threat of being ejected from the United States and separated from their families.

These children came to the United States with their parents, who reside here thanks to employer-sponsored skill-based H-1B visas. As their parents wait for Green Cards – a process that for some can take decades due to backlog – some of these individuals turn 21 and lose their legal status to continue to live in the United States. This forgotten group has been dubbed the DALCA Dreamers – the “L” stands for “legal.”

These DALCA Dreamers call America home, they are educated in the United States, and many have the potential to significantly contribute to our society and overall economic prosperity. However, they have been largely ignored in the Left’s crusade to protect DACA Dreamers because the DALCA Dreamers don’t necessarily fit in an identity politics-focused electoral model that benefits Democrats.

As Senator Rand Paul pointed out in a letter to his Congressional colleagues, the predicament these children face is not currently solved by either DACA or the DREAM Act as written.

As Congress and the president work to fix our immigration problems – including finding a compassionate solution for DACA Dreamers – we must not allow these DALCA Dreamers to fall through the cracks and be forgotten.

This should be no problem for the administration. Helping DALCA Dreamers fits perfectly with President Trump’s plan to create a merit-based immigration system. President Trump has repeatedly called for compromise and has outlined a fair, compassionate, and innovative framework for reforming our immigration system.

The White House Framework on Immigration Reform and Border Security lists “providing legal status for DACA recipients and other DACA-eligible illegal immigrants” as one of President Trump’s four priorities. President Trump’s plan provides a pathway to citizenship based on work, education, and moral character standards for 1.8 million individuals over the next 10 to 12 years – provided they do not break the law or threaten public safety or national security. The president should include the DALCA Dreamers under this pillar.

Last September, President Trump gave Congress six months to fix President Obama’s unconstitutional, overreaching DACA nightmare and exercise its constitutionally-vested power to fix our immigration system. However, thanks to a few activist court decisions, President Trump’s March 5 deadline has now come and gone.

The bright side is that while the DACA issue is being litigated in the courts, Congress has more time and opportunity to tackle this problem and develop a fair, compassionate system that ensures America remains the land of opportunity without sacrificing our safety or national security.

However, as lawmakers work on this solution, they must keep in mind how senseless, unfair, and hypocritical it would be to provide a fix for DACA Dreamers – who came here illegally – and neglect to provide a solution for the DALCA Dreamers who have followed the rules and are being victimized by our backlogged, broken system.

At the same time, the ultimate solution must be fair and just for American citizens. As President Trump said in his State of the Union Address, “Americans are dreamers too.”

There is no doubt, fixing immigration will be difficult – but it is not impossible.

Now is the time for legislators from both sides of the aisle to come together to provide a reasonable, fair solution for all the Dreamers living in our country.",politics
"Shaped like a peanut and smaller than some big-city airports, this tropical Pacific island has an unusual history. Thanks to rich deposits of a fertilizer ingredient, Nauru's 11,000 citizens were once among the wealthiest people on earth. But after much of the phosphate was plundered, Nauru squandered its wealth on bad investments, like a 1993 musical about Leonardo da Vinci.

That left the island searching for new sources of income, and in recent years it found an answer by becoming a holding station for hundreds of refugees who tried to reach Australia by boat. Australia designed a policy of keeping boat refugees and asylum seekers far from its shores to deter more of them from trying to make the voyage, but many critics say the policy violates human rights.

The fate of those refugees, including a growing number of children who advocates say are suffering from life-threatening medical conditions, is casting a shadow over the Pacific Islands Forum conference that starts in Nauru on Monday night. The forum brings together 18 members including Australia and New Zealand to discuss regional issues.

On the agenda are plans for an enhanced regional security agreement and discussions on the threat that climate change poses for low-lying islands. China's growing role in the Pacific will likely be a point of tension, with some forum members favoring diplomatic relations with Taiwan. But Nauru has been eager to limit discussion of the refugees.

For years, Nauru has effectively prevented most journalists from reporting firsthand by charging 8,000 Australian dollars ($5,750) to apply for a media visa. Nauru has waived the fee for the forum, but has allowed only a handful of journalists and placed restrictions on them.

Many of the more than 600 refugees on the island describe the hopelessness and depression they feel after being stuck in limbo for up to five years. They say they're not accepted by the locals, and that many of their children don't attend island schools because they are bullied or made to feel unwelcome.

While the U.S. has taken some of the refugees from Nauru under a deal struck by former President Barack Obama and reluctantly accepted by President Donald Trump, many refugees fleeing places like Iran and Somalia say they have no realistic hope of being allowed into the U.S. under its current immigration policies, which has sharpened their sense of despair.

A series of Australian court cases have described how some of the 120 or so refugee children on Nauru have been evacuated because they are suffering from resignation syndrome, a medical condition in which they withdraw socially and stop eating and drinking.

Ahead of the forum, Nauru has hit back at the findings.

""Sadly some refugee children on Nauru are being manipulated into self-harm by some of their families (supported by activists) in a disgusting & tragic political game,"" the government wrote on Twitter. ""The end goal is to make international headlines & get to Australia. This is the real child abuse.""

But Louise Newman, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne who has advocated for the refugee children, says some of their symptoms are impossible to fake.

""To all intents and purposes, they become comatose,"" she said. ""It's like they go into hibernation from the overwhelming stress. Their brain switches off engagement with their social environment. They don't respond to pain. Their knee-jerk reflex is absent.""

Newman said she has seen four cases of Nauru children aged between about 10 and 14 with resignation syndrome. She said they typically need to be rehydrated intravenously and that full recovery can take a year or more.

""It's very confronting,"" she said. ""It speaks to me of the terrible consequences of policies that are poorly thought through for children. Australia should not be condoning what amounts to a form of state-sponsored child abuse.""

Nauru in recent weeks has dismantled a much-criticized tent encampment that was home to some of the refugee families and relocated them into community housing. On Twitter, Nauru's government has denounced media reports that it was trying to polish its image ahead of the forum as ""#FakeNews.""

""Fact - it's dismantled because no longer needed,"" the government wrote.

Many of the leaders gathering this week in Nauru have little appetite for intervening in what they see as an issue between Nauru and Australia.

""We've got 50,000 people who are homeless back home,"" said New Zealand's Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters in Nauru, adding ""we have to help fix their lives up as well before we start taking on new obligations of the level that some people would like.""

Aside from the refugee issue, Australia faces other challenges at the forum, said Jonathan Pryke, the director of the Pacific islands program at Australia's Lowy Institute, a think tank.

A draft declaration for an enhanced security agreement states that climate change is the biggest risk to the region, Pryke said, yet climate change has become such a toxic issue in Australian politics that it helped topple former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last month.

Turnbull's replacement Scott Morrison is planning to skip the forum, which Pryke said is not a good look, and he will instead send new foreign minister Marise Payne.

""I imagine they'll have to hold their nose to sign off on the declaration,"" Pryke said of the Australian delegation.

He said that as a tiny island, Nauru, which has been independent for 50 years, has limited options for making money. Despite that, Pryke said, it has managed to confound pessimists by surviving several boom-and-bust periods and the sometimes extravagant lifestyles of its political elite.

After losing the money from the phosphate, Pryke said, Nauru, which is just 21 square kilometers (8 square miles), remade itself first as a tax haven and money laundering hub and later as the camp for Australia's refugees.

""They have been a bit of a chameleon when it comes to generating new revenue,"" he said. ""It's a good income source for them now. But it does come at the cost of the wellbeing for individuals who are on the island against their will. It's hard to justify.""",world
"New details are being released about Texas Senate Democratic nominee Beto O’Rourke’s arrest 20 years ago for drunken driving, including how a witness at the time reportedly said O’Rourke attempted to flee the scene after crashing his car.

The Houston Chronicle published police reports from O’Rourke’s September 1998 DWI arrest in Texas near the New Mexico border. The records, according to the paper, indicate the incident was a “more serious threat to public safety than has previously been reported.”

The arrest has long been public knowledge, but the details in the police reports had not.

The police reports published by the paper state that a witness said O’Rourke was driving drunk at a “high rate of speed” in a 75 mph zone on the interstate when he lost control and hit a truck. O’Rourke’s car crossed the center median and into oncoming lanes, the police report says, though no one was injured.

According to the paper, a witness stopped at the scene and said O’Rourke tried to drive away.

“The driver attempted to leave the accident but was stopped by the [witness],” a police officer wrote, according to the police report.

CRUZ, O'ROURKE IN TALKS FOR DEBATES

O’Rourke recorded 0.136 and 0.134 blood alcohol levels on Breathalyzers, the records said. The state legal limit at the time was 0.10.

O’Rourke was arrested, but had the charges dismissed after completing a court-approved diversion program, the paper said.

O’Rourke, in a statement released by his campaign, said Friday, “I drove drunk and was arrested for a DWI in 1998. As I've publicly discussed over the last 20 years, I made a serious mistake for which there is no excuse."" His campaign said the arrest is something O'Rourke has long addressed.





In a recent op-ed, O’Rourke referenced his past brushes with the law.

“Twenty-three years ago I was arrested for attempted forcible entry after jumping a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso,” O’Rourke said. “I spent a night in the El Paso County Jail, was able to make bail the next day, and was released. Three years later, I was arrested for drunk driving,” also describing it then as “a far more serious mistake for which there is no excuse.”

Added O’Rourke: “But those mistakes did not ultimately define me or stop me from what I wanted to do in my life or how I wanted to contribute to the success of my family and my community — as a father, small business owner, city council member, and congressman.”

O’Rourke, a Democratic congressman, has surged in the polls in his race against incumbent Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The Cruz campaign declined to comment.

But Texas Republicans accused O’Rourke of misleading voters about the past incident.

“While Beto touts his honesty on his DWI arrest, we now know he has been misleading Texas voters about it all,” Republican Party of Texas chairman James Dickey said.

Dickey added: “He has been misleading Texas voters about the costs and damages of the policies he’s promoting in his campaign, and also about true scope of this arrest. Texas voters deserve better.”

Meanwhile, President Trump on Friday said he planned to campaign for Cruz, his former rival during the 2016 presidential race.

“I will be doing a major rally for Senator Ted Cruz in October,” Trump tweeted. “I’m picking the biggest stadium in Texas we can find. As you know, Ted has my complete and total Endorsement. His opponent is a disaster for Texas - weak on Second Amendment, Crime, Borders, Military, and Vets!”

While recent polls indicate that O’Rourke is closing the gap on Cruz, the Real Clear Politics polling average of the race shows Cruz with a lead of 5.5 points.",politics

Pope Francis visited a famous shrine Sunday in Ireland and was to celebrate a Mass dedicated to families after an emotional meeting with Irish victims of clerical sex abuse and those wrenched away from their mothers in forced adoptions demanded by Catholic authorities.

Francis arrived Sunday in Knock, the Marian shrine in northwestern Ireland, where he prayed and blessed thousands of jubilant Irish faithful, who gathered in raincoats under clouds.

On Saturday, the first day of his visit, Francis spent 90 minutes meeting with victims of clerical and institutional abuse, including two people who were forcibly given up for adoption as newborns because their mothers weren't married. They are some of the thousands of Irish children taken from their mothers who were then forced to go live and work in laundries and other workhouses for ""fallen women.""

One of them, Clodagh Malone, said Francis was ""shocked"" at what they told him and ""he listened to each and every one of us with respect and compassion.""

The survivors asked Francis to speak out Sunday to let all the mothers know that they did nothing wrong and that it wasn't a sin — as church officials have told them — to try to find their children later in life.

They said the Argentine pope understood well their plight, given Argentina's own history of forced adoptions of children born to purported leftists during its 1970s military dictatorship.

""That is a big step forward for a lot of elderly women, particularly in the countryside in Ireland who have lived 30, 40, 50, 60 years in fear,"" another adoptee, Paul Redmond, told The Associated Press. ""That would mean a lot to them.""

Francis' first day in Ireland was dominated by the abuse scandal and Ireland's fraught history of atrocities committed in the name of preserving and purifying the Catholic faith. He received a lukewarm reception on the streets, but tens of thousands of people thronged Dublin's Croke Park Stadium for a family rally featuring Ireland's famous Riverdance performers and tenor Andrea Boccelli.

Francis' visit had originally been intended to celebrate Catholic families at the close of the Vatican's once-every-three-years World Meeting of Families. But it has been overshadowed by the abuse scandal, which has devastated the church's reputation in Ireland since the 1990s and has exploded anew in the U.S. following accusations of misconduct and cover-up by members of the U.S. hierarchy.

The U.S. scandal took on a new twist Sunday, with a former Vatican ambassador to the U.S. purportedly penning a letter accusing Vatican officials of knowing about the sexual escapades of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick since 2000, but making him a cardinal anyway. The letter attributed to Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano was published Sunday by two conservative outlets, the National Catholic Reporter and LifeSiteNews.

Francis accepted McCarrick's resignation as cardinal last month after a U.S. church investigation determined an accusation he molested a minor was ""credible."" But in the letter, Vigano said McCarrick had been initially sanctioned by the Vatican in 2009 or 2010 but that Francis rehabilitated him in 2013 despite being informed of McCarrick's penchant to invite young seminarians into his bed.

The Vatican didn't immediately comment or say if the letter was authentic.

Upon arriving in Ireland, Francis sought to respond to the outcry over the U.S. and global sex abuse and cover-up scandal during a speech to Irish government authorities at Dublin Castle.

""The failure of ecclesiastical authorities — bishops, religious superiors, priests and others — to adequately address these repugnant crimes has rightly given rise to outrage, and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community,"" he told them. ""I myself share these sentiments.""

But neither his words nor the meeting with victims assuaged demands for heads to roll over the abuse scandal.

Colm O'Gorman, who is leading a solidarity rally Sunday in Dublin for abuse victims, said Francis' remarks about sharing the shame felt by Catholics were an ""insult to faithful Catholics, who have no reason to feel shame because of the crimes of the Vatican and the institutional church.""

Separately, survivors of one of Ireland's wretched mother and baby homes were to hold their own demonstration Sunday. The location is Tuam, site of a mass grave of hundreds of babies who died at a church-run home.

Francis is nearby, at Knock, but had no plans to visit the site. He did, however, hear about Tuam on Saturday from Ireland's minister for children, Katherine Zappone. Their conversation wasn't released but Francis said her words ""still echo in my ears.""

Deeply Catholic Ireland has had one of the world's worst records of clergy sex abuse and the ill-treatment of women and children. Government-mandated inquiries concluded that thousands of children were raped or molested by priests or physically abused in church-run schools — and Irish bishops worked for years to hide those crimes.

"Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in a fiery speech Tuesday, announced legislation to prohibit lawmakers and other officials from owning or trading individual stocks -- and impose a lifetime ban on members of Congress being hired as lobbyists once they leave office.



In a speech at the National Press Club, the Massachusetts senator declared that “corruption has seeped into the fabric of our government” and said that “like a cancer eating away at our democracy, corruption has eroded Americans’ faith in our government.”



She said her proposal would “padlock the revolving door"" between big business and the federal government, and stop self-dealing by lawmakers.

""Today I'm introducing the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation proposed in Congress since Watergate,"" she claimed.



The legislation, called The Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, would ban members of Congress, Cabinet secretaries, federal judges and other government officials from owning and trading individual stocks. It would also ban foreign lobbying, ban lobbyists donating to candidates and lawmakers and slap a lifetime ban on lobbying by lawmakers, presidents and agency heads.



As Democrats gear up to fight Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, her proposal also would require the Supreme Court to follow ethics rules for other federal judges.



Warren has been widely floated as a possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. Asked Tuesday about whether she was running, she brushed off the question by saying she wasn’t running for president in 2020, but running for senator in 2018.



But in her remarks, she took a few shots at President Trump directly on the subject of corruption. She said the Trump administration was not the cause of corruption in D.C., but “they’re just the biggest stinkiest example of it.”

Her bill would also require politicians to release more tax and financial information, as she suggested Trump may be vulnerable to blackmail from foreign powers.

""Right now, that problem begins with a president who may be vulnerable to financial blackmail from a hostile foreign power and God knows who else -- because it's a president and his family who may be personally profiting off hundreds of policy decisions every day -- but we don’t know, because he won’t show us his tax returns and won’t get rid of his personal business interests,"" she said.

WARREN TO INTRODUCE THE 'ACCOUNTABLE CAPITALISM ACT'



The move represents the latest form of left-wing populism from Warren, and comes after she introduced the “Accountable Capitalism Act,” which she says would give workers a ""stronger voice in corporate decision-making at large companies.""",politics
"President Trump said Tuesday that he misspoke when he seemed to dismiss allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, stating clearly that he accepts the U.S. intelligence community's conclusions as he sought to quell a bipartisan firestorm over his press conference with Vladimir Putin.

The president clarified his remarks during a meeting with lawmakers at the White House, in a rare backtrack.

In Helsinki a day earlier, Trump had said he doesn't ""see any reason why"" Russia would be behind election meddling. This and other comments led to bipartisan outrage and accusations that he was taking Putin's word over the intelligence community's.

But Trump said Tuesday he meant the opposite. He suggested he was surprised by the negative reaction when he returned to Washington.

""I came back and said 'What is going on, what’s the big deal?'” Trump said, adding that he reviewed the transcript and ""realized that there is a need for some clarification.""

The president told reporters that he meant to say he doesn't see why Russia ""wouldn't"" be responsible.

“I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't' ... sort of a double negative,"" he said.

It's unclear whether the clarification will calm the backlash in Washington, as Trump also said following his meeting with Putin that the Russian leader gave a ""strong and powerful"" denial. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., kept up his criticism Tuesday afternoon, tweeting: ""President Trump tried to squirm away from what he said yesterday. It’s twenty-four hours too late, and in the wrong place.""

But Trump sought to make clear Tuesday that he stands behind the intelligence community.

""I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election took place,"" he said, adding: ""It could be other people also.""

Trump's comments came after even his allies urged him to clean up the press conference statements from Finland. Until now, Trump had battled his critics via Twitter while defending his trip abroad.

Trump tweeted earlier Tuesday that his earlier NATO meeting, where he pressed allies to commit more in defense spending, as well as the Putin summit were a success. Further, he argued his actions at NATO would be bad for Russia.

“I had a great meeting with NATO. They have paid $33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future, only because of me. NATO was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for Russia). The media only says I was rude to leaders, never mentions the money!” Trump tweeted on Tuesday.

He added, moments later, that his meeting with Putin was “even better.”

“While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way—the Fake News is going Crazy!”

Trump continued to defend the meetings themselves while speaking to lawmakers at the White House, touting them as a success.

""We are going to have peace, that's what we want, and that's what we're going to have. I say peace through strength,"" Trump said of his talks with NATO allies, noting that the talks brought a ""great spirit that we didn't have before.""

Trump also defended his meeting with Putin, saying he entered with a strategy of ""diplomacy"" and ""engagement,"" which is ""better than hostility.""

Trump said he was in a position of ""strength"" in the meeting.

""Our economy is booming, and our military ... it will be more powerful of a military than we've ever had before,"" Trump said, noting the range of topics he and Putin discussed included Syria, Iran, nuclear proliferation, North Korea and Israel.

""I think the meeting I had with President Putin was really strong. I think they were willing to do things, frankly I thought they wouldn't be willing to do,"" Trump said. ""It was a very, very good meeting.""

Trump had angered members of both parties, though, by saying both countries are to blame for damaged U.S.-Russian relations, and letting Putin deny election meddling unchallenged.

Democrats let loose on the president in response.

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said earlier Tuesday that Trump's remarks were ""nothing short of treason,"" echoing comments from Obama CIA boss John Brennan. He brushed off pressure from the party’s left flank to pursue impeachment, calling the issue a “distraction” – but kept the door open for some kind of future rebuke, saying there will be time to address such issues “once we take control of the House back.”

“Russia did meddle with our elections,” House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters on Capitol Hill Tuesday, while urging the U.S. to aid other democracies around the world in protecting their election systems. “We know that they interfered, and we have passed sanctions…to make sure they don’t interfere again.”

Ryan suggested that the U.S. “will face this Russian aggression again.”

When asked whether he thought Trump was treasonous, he responded: “I do not.”

Ryan did say, however, that Special Counsel Robert Mueller “should be allowed to carry out his work” in investigating Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.

On the Senate side, Republicans are discussing a new measure to back the intelligence community’s findings that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. So far, a similar measure has not been introduced or discussed in the House.

“I do think that the findings ... during the end of the Obama administration provides a road map to what the Russians did, as do the indictment of the 12 Russian GRU intelligence officials. And we’d better wake up,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said on the Senate floor Tuesday.

Cornyn added that he “trusts” the intelligence community and the special counsel investigation “so far.”

“[The investigation] has shown there was absolutely no collusion with the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence activity leading up to the election,” Cornyn said. “That’s what I think has got the president so spun up, is because he feels this is an attack on him personally.”

He added: “I wish we could separate those two. But indeed our Democratic colleagues don’t want to separate those because they realize that this is the best way to keep this story going for as long as they can, through the next election, and who knows, through the presidential election as well.”

Trump was hit with a blistering statement from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has been out of Washington for months battling brain cancer. He called the president’s performance “disgraceful.”

Even some of the president’s closest surrogates, like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, criticized his comments and urged him to address them.

"Long after the FBI cut ties with former British spy and Trump dossier author Christopher Steele, senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr continued to maintain extensive contact with him, according to newly reported emails.

The emails, first reported by The Hill, reveal Steele even continued to send information to Ohr after the election.

The FBI “suspended and then terminated” Steele as a source in early November 2016 for what the bureau defined as “the most serious of violations” – an “unauthorized disclosure to the media of his relationship with the FBI,” according to a House Republican memo earlier this year. The FBI reportedly told Steele at the time he could no longer “operate to obtain any intelligence whatsoever on behalf of the FBI.”

Yet the emails show Ohr, a former associate deputy attorney general, and Steele communicated extensively from 2002 all the way into 2017.

One text message from Steele to Ohr on Jan. 31, 2017 reportedly said: “B, doubtless a sad and crazy day for you re-SY.” The text is an apparent reference to President Trump’s firing of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates.

The text continued: “Just want to check you are OK, still in the situ and able to help locally as discussed, along with your Bureau colleagues.”

Ohr reportedly replied: “I’m still here and able to help as discussed….I’ll let you know if that changes.”

Steele reportedly said: “If you end up out though, I really need another (bureau?) contact point/number who is briefed. We can’t allow our guy to be forced to go back home. It would be disastrous.”

It is unclear what and whom Steele was referring to in that exchange.

The Hill reported that FBI officials admitted they continued to receive information from Steele through Ohr.

The FBI declined to comment when asked by Fox News whether the bureau relied on Steele’s intelligence after their working relationship was terminated.

Steele also sent one email to Ohr on July 1, 2016, obtained by The Hill, making an apparent reference to Trump.

“I am seeing [redacted] in London next week to discuss ongoing business, but there is something separate I wanted to discuss with you informally and separately,” Steele wrote. “It concerns out favourite business tycoon!”

Ohr and Steele reportedly had a call on the morning of July 7, 2016.

Steele authored and compiled information for the controversial and unverified anti-Trump dossier on behalf of Fusion GPS, which was hired to conduct opposition research funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign through law firm Perkins Coie.

Last year, Fox News confirmed that Ohr’s wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS during the 2016 election. According to court documents obtained by Fox News last year, Fusion GPS hired Mrs. Ohr to help investigate Trump. A separate Fox News review of her previous published works reveal she wrote extensively on Russia-related subjects.

The dossier “formed an essential part” of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants approved to surveil then-Trump campaign associate Carter Page, according to the House GOP memo alleging government surveillance abuse during 2016.

According to new documents obtained this week by The Washington Examiner, Ohr also continued communicating with Fusion co-founder Glenn Simpson before, during and after the election.

Other emails obtained by the Examiner reveal Steele’s communications with Russian aluminum financier Oleg Deripaska. Steele emailed with Ohr about Deripaska, who was seeking a visa to attend a meeting in the U.S. According to the Examiner, the U.S. revoked Deripaska’s visa based on alleged involvement with Russian organized crime.

Deripaska was reportedly close to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Those communications raised questions of whether Steele was working with Deripaska while working on the dossier, and whether Fusion GPS and the Justice Department were involved.",politics
"An aide for Cynthia Nixon, the Democrat running in the New York gubernatorial primary against Governor Andrew Cuomo, reportedly asked to control the temperature of the room in which the two candidates are scheduled to debate this week, citing sexism.

Nixon and Cuomo are set to debate Wednesday night at Hofstra University in Long Island, to be moderated and aired by WCBS-TV.

CYNTHIA NIXON MOCKS CUOMO'S REMARKS BASHING AMERICA, AS 'GREATGATE' ESCALATES

The news station, according to The New York Times, received an email from Nixon's team last week requesting that the station keep the debate room's temperature at 76 degrees.

Cuomo likes to work in cool conditions, The Times reported in 2011, following the governor's inauguration.

Rebecca Katz, a strategist for Nixon, reportedly told the local CBS station that working conditions are ""notoriously sexist when it comes to room temperature, so we just want to make sure we’re all on the same page here.""

Katz told the newspaper that as of Tuesday, she had not yet heard from WCBS, which declined to comment to The Times.

GOV. ANDREW CUOMO FINALLY AGREES TO DEBATE CYNTHIA NIXON

""Unlike Cynthia Nixon, the Governor has more important things to focus on than the temperature of a room,"" Cuomo's campaign told Fox News in a statement.

"City officials in Portland, Ore., say they'll be cleaning up the “disgusting” Occupy ICE camp after police cleared the area of protesters Wednesday.

The mayor’s office said it would pick up a portion of the tab for the clean-up, FOX 12 reported. Meanwhile, the Portland Police Bureau has cordoned off the site, calling it a biohazard.

Activists set up the camp near the local office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an outcry over the agency's crackdown on illegal immigrants.

The protesters advocated abolishing the agency, an objective that is increasingly being embraced by top mainstream Democrats in Congress, including U.S. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

DEMOCRATS CALLING FOR ICE TO BE ABOLISHED INCLUDE KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, ELIZABETH WARREN AND OTHERS

“It was pretty disgusting that that’s how they were living back there,” Frank Savage, a Portland resident who lives near the camp, told the outlet.

“It was pretty disgusting that that’s how they were living back there. Getting tired of waking up to the bullhorn and the sounds and the cussing.” - Frank Savage, Portland, Ore., resident who lives near the Occupy ICE camp

He said that the area was littered by the protesters but is now relieved that things will go back to normal. “Getting tired of waking up to the bullhorn and the sounds and the cussing,” he added.

Debris being cleared Wednesday included wooden pallets, makeshift toilets, books, toys, plastic containers, liquor bottles, tents and furniture, photos published by the Oregonian showed.

Mayor Ted Wheeler publicly ordered the Occupy ICE protesters to leave the camp Monday, but they ignored the mayor’s request.

That prompted Portland police to step in and clear the protesters. No tickets or arrests were made in the process.

“For the most part everything was done with very little incident,” police Chief Danielle Outlaw said.

This was the second time authorities had to intervene to disperse the protesters in Portland who set up camps. Last month, Homeland Security police had to clear out activists who occupied an ICE building in the city in protest of President Trump’s zero-tolerance policy toward immigration and the separation of migrant children from their parents.

As officers were clearing up the building, protesters were heard chanting “No racist police!” and some activists were pointing in each of the officers’ faces and calling them “Nazis.”

PORTLAND ICE FACILITY PROTEST CAMP BROKEN UP BY FEDS AS CROWDS SHOUT ‘NOT RACIST POLICE!’

The city is having contractors clean up the mess left by the activists. The efforts will also receive help from Multnomah County inmates, who will receive work-time credit and other financial incentives, the sheriff’s office reportedly said.

The camp was set up on land owned by the city and TriMet, a public agency in charge of the public transit system in Portland’s metropolitan area.

A TriMet official said they don’t know why the protesters who started the camp can’t be held accountable for the costs associated with cleaning the area.

“I can’t answer that. I just don’t think there is a mechanism to reimburse for the cost,” the official told FOX 12.

The city doesn’t yet have an estimate of the total cost of the cleanup.",politics
"The parents of freelance journalist Austin Tice told Fox News Wednesday night that they have “confidence” that their son is still alive, six years after he vanished under frightening circumstances in Syria.

Tice, who would now be 37 years old, disappeared in 2012 after stopping at a checkpoint in Syria while on his way into Lebanon. Five weeks after his disappearance, a video surfaced showing Tice blindfolded and being held by armed men. That was the last time Tice was seen alive.

Marc and Debra Tice told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum they have “confidence” that their son is still alive and waiting to come home.

“We know he’s waiting for us to do whatever it takes to get him home free, we just can’t wait for that day,” Marc said on “The Story.”

He also said that those involved with bringing Tice home also have that same “confidence” that he’s still alive.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Tuesday at a briefing that U.S. investigators “believe him to be alive.”

Nauert continued, “We remain deeply concerned about his well-being and we’re actively working to bring Austin Tice home.”

While the identities of his apparent kidnappers remain murky, investigators fear they may have links to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's murderous regime, as The Washington Post noted.

Tice's parents also praised the current administration’s efforts to find their son.

“We really do admire this administration’s commitment to bringing Americans home, they certainly got a good track record so far and we really look forward to the day where we see Austin be another one of their wins,” Debra said.

“We have a high level of confidence” in the current administration, Marc added.

Further information regarding Tice’s whereabouts and the identity of his captures has remained intentionally unknown. The FBI recently offered a $1 million ewward for information leading directly to his “safe location, recovery and return.”

Syria has proven to be an especially dangerous country for reporters. Of the 54 journalists believed to be held hostage around the world, 29 are in Syria, according to Reporters Without Borders.

"The latest rallying cry from the far left to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) isn’t a likely winner this election year, as a new poll finds only a quarter of Democrats support eliminating the agency supported by the Trump administration.

The findings demonstrate tension among Democrats about how to address the crisis at the border that intensified in June, as the White House came under fire over the separations of illegal-immigrant families.

But even as they don’t want to fully dismantle ICE, 57 percent of Democrats view the agency negatively, including nearly three-fourths of those who describe themselves as liberal, according to the poll released Monday by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Last month, a Fox News Poll found that the call to abolish ICE was not trending among voters. The July poll showed that 41 percent of registered voters approved of how ICE was handling its job, while an identical 41 percent disapproved. The poll also discovered that, by a margin of more than 2 to 1, voters were against disbanding the agency — 42 percent opposing vs. 18 percent favoring.

Some potential 2020 Democratic presidential contenders, such as Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, backed getting rid of ICE in response to the separations. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in June: “The president’s deeply immoral actions have made it obvious we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our morality and that works.”

Others, including Sen. Kamala Harris of California, urged a rethinking of the agency, but stopped short of calling for its abolition.

The push to abolish ICE became something of a litmus test among liberal Democrats this summer after self-declared socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unseated a 10-term party leader for a New York congressional seat in part by campaigning on the issue. But it hasn’t proved a political winner in other races.

President Trump has seized on the Democratic criticism of ICE to paint the party as weak on immigration and national security.

The administration worked to reunite separated families after an international outcry, but the process is ongoing.

Overall, opinions about ICE are divided along partisan lines.

While a majority of Democrats view the agency negatively, Republicans largely have favorable views of ICE.

A full one-third of Americans have said they're too unfamiliar with the agency to form an opinion, according to the AP poll.

DEMOCRATS CALLING TO ABOLISH ICE INCLUDE GILLIBRAND, WARREN AND OTHERS

Dianne Stone, a 68-year-old retired bus driver from Charlotte, North Carolina, said ICE should be modified but not scrapped. After spending decades living in Southern California, she said ICE ought to be less of a law enforcement agency, and more dedicated to helping immigrants negotiate the border.

“Yes, there are more drugs and crime coming across the border than years ago. But you can’t keep kids in cages,” Stone said. “ICE can be part of a more sophisticated vetting process where you’re keeping criminals out.”

The public largely is critical of the administration’s progress in reuniting families. Nearly 6 in 10 think the Trump administration is doing too little, though 8 percent say it’s doing too much, and a third think it is doing enough, the AP poll showed.

Anna Lee Lish was appalled by the scenes of children separated from their parents at the border in June, but does not blame ICE for the problem.

“I thought it was horrific,” said the 60-year-old social worker from Pocatello, Idaho. “ICE was just doing its job, following orders. But it’s the policy of separating families that needs to change, not abandon ICE.”

The partisan divide is dramatic: 85 percent of Democrats say the administration is doing too little to reunite children with their families, compared to 22 percent of Republicans in the AP poll. Still, that means nearly a quarter of Republicans feel the administration should be doing more.

Reviews of Trump’s overall handling of immigration also are divided.

More than three-quarters of Republicans largely have favorable views of the president’s immigration performance, while more than 90 percent of Democrats disapprove. Nearly two-thirds of independent voters said they don’t approve of Trump’s handling of the issue.

And while the Trump administration seeks to curb legal immigration, Americans are more likely to say they want to keep it at existing levels — 42 percent — than to want the number of immigrants let in to be increased — 29 percent — or decreased — 28 percent, the AP poll found.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,055 adults was conducted Aug. 16-20 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.

"President Trump lashed out again Wednesday at Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, asking ""how the hell"" he is still employed after he testified on Capitol Hill about his relationship with former British spy Christopher Steele and his ties to the now infamous anti-Trump dossier.

“How the hell is Bruce Ohr still employed at the Justice Department?” Trump tweeted. “Disgraceful! Witch Hunt!”

Republicans allege that Ohr played a key role in selling the so-called Steele dossier, commissioned by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS and paid for by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Ohr was grilled over his involvement behind closed doors on Tuesday by the House Oversight and Judiciary committees

Messages indicate Ohr continued to communicate with dossier author Steele after the FBI fired him as a source in late 2016 due to his contacts with the media.

“I don’t know if it's improper but I want to know who at DOJ knew and it certainly looks like he continued to meet with Mr. Steele after the FBI had terminated their relationship with Mr. Steele,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Fox News ahead of the Tuesday meeting.

Ohr’s wife Nellie worked at Fusion as a Russian specialist and did research that formed part of the dossier.

Ohr, who joined the Justice Department in 1991 and eventually was named the associate deputy attorney general before being demoted amid the investigation into his meetings with Steele, did not reply to questions shouted by reporters before his hearing on Tuesday.

At least seven Republican House members traveled to Washington over the August recess for the interview. No Democratic lawmakers appeared to attend, though staff were in the room.

Democrats say the entire GOP investigation is an attempt to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller. They have criticized the Republicans' focus on Ohr as overblown and misleading.

“With Paul Manafort in jail, Michael Cohen in court, and a host of longtime Trump confidants cooperating with federal prosecutors, we can understand why Republicans are increasingly desperate to create a distraction and undermine the Department of Justice as a hedge against what the investigators may find,"" Reps. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Elijah E. Cummings, D-Md., said Wednesday in a joint statement.

The two lawmakers added: ""Mr. Ohr has already been forced to endure President Trump’s baseless Twitter attacks. Yesterday’s interview was merely a doubling down of that strategy."" Nadler and Cummings serve as ranking members on the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees respectively.

Trump’s tweet on Wednesday was not the first time the president has singled out Ohr.

Trump said last Friday that it was a ""disgrace"" for Ohr to be in the Justice Department and added that he suspects he'll ""very quickly"" revoke his security clearance. That tweet, along with his revoking of the security clearance for former CIA Director John Brennan, have drawn strong criticism from many in the intelligence community and raised questions of whether Trump may be obstructing the Mueller investigation.

Mueller and his team have been looking at Trump's public statements and tweets as they investigate the obstruction question.

""I don't think it advances the criminal obstruction case, but I think it's factually relevant,"" said Mark Zaid, a national security attorney. ""I think it shows the state of mind and intent to interfere or impede any unfavorable discussion of his potential connection to Russia.""

"President Trump initially decided against releasing an official White House statement on Sen. John McCain following his death, two administration sources confirmed to Fox News.

The statement would have praised him for his decades of service and his heroism as a Vietnam War POW. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and other senior aides all had pushed for such a statement, which would have called McCain a “hero.”

The president, however, rejected the statement and instead issued a brief tweet Saturday night following the legendary Arizona Republican senator’s death.

The tweet said, “My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!”

The decision on the statement was first reported by The Washington Post.

The president eventually issued a statement late Monday afternoon announcing top officials will attend McCain's service, Vice President Pence will speak at a Capitol ceremony on Friday and U.S. flags will fly at half-staff until his internment.

""Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain’s service to our country and, in his honor, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment,"" Trump said, in a statement largely focused on the services of the coming days.

Trump’s decision to nix the earlier statement speaks to the longstanding feud between the two men, dating back to when Trump, as a candidate, said McCain was not a war hero and seemed to fault him for being captured during the Vietnam War. McCain endured five years in captivity, an experience that later shaped his views, as a senator, on interrogation techniques. Known as the Senate’s “maverick,” McCain often bucked party ideology, earning him praise on Democratic side of the aisle and sometimes criticism from his own party – but he remained an influential voice even through his battle with brain cancer. He twice ran for president and was the Republican Party’s presidential nominee in 2008.

Tributes to McCain, meanwhile, poured in from other world leaders and statesmen including former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.

“Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did. But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own,” Barack and Michelle Obama said in their statement.

“In an era filled with cynicism about national unity and public service, John McCain’s life shone as a bright example. He showed us that boundless patriotism and self-sacrifice are not outdated concepts or clichés, but the building blocks of an extraordinary American life,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement.

McConnell also announced that McCain will lie in State at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.",politics
"The biggest news story in 2018 is not Omarosa or Stormy Daniels – it is the booming economy, according to Director of the White House Economic Council Larry Kudlow, who made that case to pals at a recent dinner. He is right, of course. The acceleration in U.S. growth, bringing rising wages and increased job opportunities across the board, is a monumental achievement of the Trump White House. Especially since so many liberal economists, like Larry Summers, said it couldn’t be done.

The second biggest news item is that President Trump’s approval ratings have held steady as a rock, especially among Republicans. There is a ferocity among his followers that does not attach in this era to any other political figure, and for that we can credit, at least in part, the media. The worse their attacks on the president become, the more steadfast his support. Go figure.

The third biggest story, in my view, is that many GOP candidates appear oblivious to both these themes. Democrats spend more time talking about the economy and the GOP tax cuts than Republicans do; they certainly have more to say about the president. Many Republicans running for office appear embarrassed by the economic power unleashed by lower tax rates and deregulation; it’s almost as though they don’t understand what is happening. At best, they seem unable to articulate why the tax cuts are helping their voters.

These reluctant Republicans have allowed Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues to set the narrative about the GOP tax cuts and the buoyant economy. Democrats began lying about the GOP tax bill before it was even written, with Chuck Schumer et al initially saying that it would not benefit middle-class workers. When numerous analyses indicated that claim was flat-out wrong, and as Americans discovered the savings in their paychecks, their tune changed, slightly. Now they stress that the gains are mostly flowing to the wealthy, and to big, fat corporations. They are hoping the politics of envy will override relief that jobs are suddenly plentiful and that consumer optimism is off the charts, for the first time in a decade.

Here’s a heads-up: midterm elections are always about turnout. Always. Trump, and Trump alone in many districts, will drive GOP turnout. He is the energy in the party, his is the story – and he can tell it better than anyone. Do they really think John Kasich boosted Troy Balderson’s vote?

A recent story in the New York Times is typical. It says the lower taxes on businesses are “unlocking tens of millions of dollars in campaign donations from the wealthy conservatives and corporate interests that benefitted handsomely from it.” The piece names various people and corporations who have donated to the Congressional Leadership Fund, and hints that Sheldon Adelson, for instance, gave $30 million to the Paul Ryan-linked Super Pac with monies received from the tax reform bill.

The Times fails to mention that Adelson has in previous elections topped that figure, and has consistently supported Republicans and Donald Trump. They also neglect to list the billionaires who have given millions to House Majority, the corresponding Democrat Super Pac, like Paloma Partners founder Donald Sussman or Euclidean Capital, the family office of hedge fund wizard James Simon. Were their donations a direct result of the GOP tax cuts, too?

The Times piece quotes Corry Bliss, the head of the Super PAC working to hold onto the GOP majority in Congress, saying he had “all but begged every campaign to run on the middle-class tax cut,” to no avail. He says, “In this environment, if you don’t make clear the contrasts between the two teams, then you are not going to get the benefit of the doubt.”

He notes that two incumbent Republicans running in contested districts carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016 – Carlos Curbelo in Florida and Will Hurd in Texas – are running better than expected by doing just that.

For the past year, Democrats have hoped that anti-Trump sentiment would translate to a Blue Wave, giving them the 24 seats needed to flip control of the House of Representatives and maybe even gaining an advantage in the Senate. They have clung to a couple of special election outcomes, mainly Conor Lamb’s win in Pennsylvania’s 18th District and more recently the tight race in Ohio’s 12th, to bolster their hopes. They can also cite history; almost always the party in the White House leaks power in the midterms.

But Trump continues to turn convention on its head. The recent Ohio race was close, but – let’s be honest – the president’s last-minute rally for Republican Troy Balderson appears to have pushed him over the edge. (The official tally drags on.) Before voting day, internal GOP polling showed Balderson trailing rival Danny O’Connor. Party officials had written off the seat.

Republican candidates and strategists anguish over President Trump’s popularity and dither over whether to back him. Here’s a heads-up: midterm elections are always about turnout. Always. Trump, and Trump alone in many districts, will drive GOP turnout. He is the energy in the party, his is the story – and he can tell it better than anyone. Do they really think John Kasich boosted Troy Balderson’s vote?

Democrats are counting on anti-Trump fever to drive their voters to the polls. Since the party has yet to present a platform that excites Americans, they are relying on their constituents to vote against Donald Trump. For many, that will be enough. But it is a risky strategy, especially since a number of Democrats’ core constituents appear tilting ever so slightly in Trump’s direction. African-American support for the president has increased, according to a variety of polls, as has his approval ratings among Hispanics. Both those groups, most likely, appreciate the better job opportunities they see, and their rising wages.

President Trump will doubtless campaign relentlessly between now and November, and candidates would do well to ask for his support. They would also be well advised to talk up the economy. That is indeed the biggest story of the year, for all Americans.",politics
"Connecticut is joining a growing alliance of liberal states in a ""pact"" that would supposedly allow them to change the way presidents are picked -- by allocating each state's electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote.

The uphill campaign, which if ever brought to fruition would almost certainly face a court challenge, has gained renewed attention amid Democratic grumbling about the Electoral College in the wake of President Trump's 2016 win. While he defeated Hillary Clinton in the electoral vote, he lost the popular vote by 2.9 million ballots.

Enter the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which blue states are joining to commit to allocating their electoral votes to the national popular-vote winner -- regardless of their own state results.

The pact is meant to be a work-around to the constitutional requirements that created the Electoral College system, which awards each state's electors to the winner of that state.

In theory, the game-changing compact would take effect once it signs on states representing at least 270 electoral votes, the threshold to win the presidency. With the expected addition of Connecticut's seven electoral votes, the group now has 172.

Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy is expected to sign the legislation into law, following the state Senate approving legislation opting Connecticut into the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact on May 5. The state House passed the legislation last month.

“The National Popular Vote Compact will ensure an equal vote for every American citizen, regardless of which state they happen to live in,” Malloy said in a statement.

Other jurisdictions that have joined the pact include California, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia — all places where Clinton defeated Trump in 2016. Connecticut would be the first state to sign on since 2014, when New York joined.

“The vote of every American citizen should count equally, yet under the current system, voters from sparsely populated states are awarded significantly more power than those from states like Connecticut,” Malloy said. “This is fundamentally unfair.”

But critics say the pact would actually hurt smaller states like Connecticut, given that candidates would be likely to only focus on large population centers and neglect rural areas.

And from a constitutional perspective, the proposal could also run into obvious legal challenges.

“Not only did the framers of the Constitution expressly reject the idea of a direct, popular election for president, but also not one state either in the wake of ratification or at any time thereafter has ever sought to appoint its presidential electors on the basis of votes cast outside the state, as the National Popular Vote Compact requires,” law professor Norman R. Williams argued in the BYU Law Review.

Trump has not publicly supported The National Popular Vote Compact. But he has said he would prefer picking a president based on the popular vote.

“I would rather have a popular election, but it's a totally different campaign,"" Trump said during an interview last month ""Fox & Friends.""

The plan has been pushed for last several years, and proponents are working to get other states to pass legislation joining the pact. According to the National Popular Vote website, the proposal has passed in at least one house in 11 other states, including Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma and Oregon.",politics
"Rick Gates on Monday took the stand in the federal fraud case against his former business partner, ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, testifying that he and Manafort conspired to commit bank and tax fraud -- and that he embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from Manafort.

The day ended with the judge in the case ripping into prosecutors, telling them to expedite their case. But earlier, federal prosecutor Greg Andres got the government's star witness to admit he committed crimes while working for Manafort.

“Did you commit crimes with Mr. Manafort?” Andres asked Gates after he took the stand.

“Yes,” Gates said.

Manafort, facing charges of bank and tax fraud related to his work in Ukraine, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Gates struck a plea deal with prosecutors to cooperate in the case against his former business partner. The usually bearded Gates appeared in court clean-shaven on Monday.

During his testimony, Gates read out loud the language from his indictment charging him with conspiracy and making false statements to the government.

“Who did you conspire with?” the prosecutor asked.

“Paul Manafort,” Gates replied.

Gates testified that he and Manafort under-reported income and failed to file FBAR, or Foreign Bank Account Report, forms.

Gates said that Manafort requested “over the years” that Gates make wire transfers from foreign accounts “primarily in Cyprus,” and those funds were not reported.

Gates also testified that he lied to Manafort’s bookkeeper and accountants.

He replied “yes” when asked if he knew it was a crime not to file those reports.

Gates also admitted to embezzling “several hundred thousand” dollars from Manafort while working for him.

The trial is set to reconvene Tuesday morning. Andres, the prosecutor, said to expect another three hours of Gates testimony.

After the jury was dismissed for the day, there were fireworks as U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis III lit into Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team, telling the prosecution to expedite its case against Manafort.

During the back-and-forth, Ellis admonished the prosecutor for not looking at him while speaking. “Look at me! Don’t look down!”

Andres responded that he was looking at a relevant document, but the exchange got more heated. “You looked down as if to say: that’s B.S.!” Ellis said.

Gates' testimony is important for prosecutors: Ellis said in court last week they “can’t prove conspiracy” in the case unless prosecutors call Gates to the stand.

During opening arguments last week, the defense team made it clear they intend to blame Gates, who handled some day-to-day business operations for Manafort, for many of the alleged reporting deficiencies Manafort is charged with.

“Rick Gates had his hand in the cookie jar and couldn’t let his boss find out,” Manafort defense attorney Thomas Zehnle said during opening arguments.

Prosecutors have introduced a bevy of exhibits and are in the process of calling several witnesses as part of their effort to paint Manafort as a tax scofflaw who failed to report money spent on luxury items -- then lied to get bank loans when his foreign consulting work dried up.

The judge in the Paul Manafort trial reminded prosecutors on Friday of the high bar for conviction -- that they must prove the former Trump campaign chairman knowingly violated tax and bank laws related to his political work overseas.

Manafort served as chairman of Trump’s presidential campaign during the summer of 2016, and was forced out in August of that year amid news stories about his ties to then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

Earlier Monday, Ellis threatened to kick reporters out of the courtroom if they continue being “disruptive.”

“If you cause a disruption, I will have you excluded!” Ellis said.

MANAFORT CASE JUDGES ADMONISHES ‘DISRUPTIVE’ REPORTERS DURING TRIAL

The warning came after multiple reporters rushed out of the courtroom at the same time Monday after it was announced that Gates would testify Monday.

Under rules, reporters covering the trial cannot use phones or laptops in the courtroom and must go outside to transmit news from inside.

Ellis, a 78-year-old Reagan-appointed judge, is known for his colorful comments.

"The U.S. campaign to rein in Iran has scored a victory in the German financial sector, after the Deutsche Bundesbank− the country’s central bank− imposed a rule stopping a $400 million cash delivery to Tehran.

Iran's cash-starved economy desperately needs hard currency ahead of crippling U.S. bank sanctions that will be introduced in November.

Germany allows the Iranian-owned European-Iranian trade bank (EIH) to operate in Hamburg. The EIH holds more than $400 million that Tehran wants to receive in cash ahead of a second wave of U.S. sanctions due in November that impact banks and Iran’s energy sector.

The Deutsche Bundesbank has cooperated with the EIH in the past to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. The U.S. and the European Union previously sanctioned the EIH for its role in advancing Iran’s nuclear and missile programs. The sanctions on the EIH were lifted after the world powers reached an agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program in 2015.

IRAN CROWDS REPORTEDLY CHANT 'DEATH TO THE DICTATOR!' AS US SANCTIONS INCREASE ECONOMIC UNREST

But President Trump effectively tore up the “decaying and rotten” deal in May and vowed to impose greater sanctions on the regime.

The disclosure in July that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government was seeking to circumvent the pending sanctions triggered the U.S. ambassador to Germany to urge her government to stop the massive payment transfer.

“We are grateful to our German partners for recognizing the need to act.

Iran’s malign activities throughout Europe are a growing concern,” Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Berlin, told FoxNews.com. Grenell, a former Fox News contributor, led the campaign to persuade German authorities to prevent the cash transfer.

The U.S. embassy to Berlin tweeted: ""Close partnership = results. Thank you to our German counterparts for acting to stop Iran’s activities.""

The German central bank's new anti-Iran rule is slated to go into effect on August, 25.

Chancellor Merkel's efforts to send more than $400 million to the mullah regime echoes the Obama administration’s 2016 delivery of $1.7 billion in cash to Tehran, as part of a ransom to secure the release of American hostages held by the Islamic Republic.

President Trump has repeatedly slammed his predecessor for sending the cash.

The United States government has classified the Islamic Republic of Iran as a top state-sponsor of terrorism. The Merkel administration is going to great lengths to promote trade with Tehran. The German Economy Ministry said on Monday “export guarantees and investment guarantees from the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs are still available to companies” that want to operate in Iran.

Germany's government provides 57 companies with more than $1 billion in export and investment guarantees for their business with Iran.

TRUMP RENEWS 'BITING SANCTIONS' AGAINST IRAN, WARNS COUNTRIES DOING BUSINESS WITH TEHRAN

Major German multinational companies, however, are voting with their feet.

Automobile manufacturer Mercedes-Benz announced on Tuesday that it had frozen all business with Iran due “to applicable sanctions.” The first wave of U.S. sanctions kicked in on Tuesday and will impact Iran’s automobile sector, as well as trade in precious metals.

Sportswear giant Adidas meanwhile followed the lead of its U.S. competitor Nike and pulled the plug on its business with Iran.

Adidas said in a statement last week that it will not extend commercial agreements with Iran's soccer association. Iran's state- controlled media reported that Adidas withdrew from Iran's market because it fears damage to its business in the U.S.

Peter Kohanloo, the president of the U.S.-based Iranian American Majority organization, told FoxNews.com: “Germany, France and the UK always talk about human rights and democracy, but by resisting more sanctions, they’re actively opposing a growing revolution inside Iran to replace one of the most egregious human rights violating dictatorships in the world.

“Germany is making a huge mistake by injecting much-needed cash into the mullahs’ resistance economy as they murder Iranian protesters.”

IRAN'S WIDESPREAD AND GROWING PROTESTS PUSH CITIZENS TO BRINK

In a joint statement on Monday, Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, and the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany said: “We are determined to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran.”

The EU implemented a “blocking statute” to insulate EU companies active in the Islamic Republic from American sanctions.

The Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry said on its website that in the first five months of this year, exports to Iran dropped by four percent.

Over the last few years, 120 German companies have opened offices in Iran, according to the German industry group, but that trend is sinking.

German exports to Iran climbed to $3.96 billion in 2017, up from $2.89 billion in 2016.",politics
"President Trump declared his administration the ""most transparent in history"" Saturday, saying his White House staff has supplied more than a million pages of information to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators.

In a Twitter message Saturday evening, the president said he allowed White House attorney Don McGahn and others on the White House staff to ""fully cooperate"" with Mueller in a bid to show there was ""no collusion"" and ""no obstruction.""

The president's message followed reports that McGahn had spoken with investigators from Mueller’s investigative team multiple times, which Fox News confirmed Saturday.

The revelation came amid a New York Times report, citing multiple sources, indicating that McGahn willingly spoke to the team members – who are looking into, among other things, whether President Trump obstructed justice – for 30 hours over the course of at least three separate occasions. He reportedly gave insight into Trump's demeanor regarding Mueller’s investigation.

The special counsel is investigating alleged Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.

Specific incidents mentioned in these conversations included moments surrounding Trump’s decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey, and his reported preference that Attorney General Jeff Sessions oversee the investigation, according to the Times. (Sessions ultimately recused himself.)

Trump seemingly responded to the Saturday's report tweeting: ""I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn, and all other requested members of the White House Staff, to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion, No Obstruction. Witch Hunt!""

A source familiar with the investigation confirmed to Fox News that McGahn spoke to Mueller at length on three occasions. However, the source played down the Times article, saying that there didn’t seem to be anything revelatory in the report’s information and adding that it was already known that Trump instructed McGahn to cooperate with Mueller’s team.

The special counsel declined to comment when contacted by Fox News.

McGahn initially began working with Mueller’s team at the behest of Trump’s original team of lawyers, the Times reported. McGahn and his own lawyer, William Burck, were surprised by this decision, sources told the newspaper, and questioned whether he was potentially being set up. As a result, they reportedly decided to cooperate in order to clear McGahn of any wrongdoing.

Burck released a statement saying, ""President Trump, through counsel, declined to assert any privilege over Mr. McGahn's testimony, so Mr. McGahn answered the Special Counsel team's questions fulsomely and honestly, as any person interviewed by federal investigators must.""

John Dowd, Trump’s former lead outside attorney, told Fox News that “Don McGahn was a very strong witness for the president.”

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News, “The president and Don have a great relationship. He appreciates all the hard work he’s done, particularly his help and expertise with the judges and the Supreme Court.”

The Times report comes amid pressure from Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, for Mueller to conclude the monthslong investigation.

“Time for Mueller investigation to file report,” Giuliani tweeted earlier Saturday. “We will release ours. Don’t interfere with election like Comey. The President had nothing to do with Russians. He didn’t obstruct an investigation. 1.4 million documents and 32 witnesses no privilege raised.”

"Anti-Trump news organizations continued to attack the president this past week on many fronts, including for what CNN Senior Political Analyst John Avlon called “a real culture of corruption.” In reality, Avlon should have been describing the state of journalism.

CNN, that stalwart of James Earl Jones voiceovers, has no room to point fingers. It got caught believing another phony story about President Trump and is too stubborn and woke to admit it. (Sort of like when three CNN investigative journalists had to resign in 2017, except then the network admitted they were wrong.)

Meanwhile, NBC is facing allegations from a former top producer that executives actively interfered in reporting on allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. And The New York Times has become increasingly obvious about the word play it injects into news stories, so its left-wing agenda remains intact.

There are far too many failure points in the media to fit easily into one column – journalists ignoring Texas Democratic Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke’s past DUI arrest; hypocritical outlets that claim to love Republicans only after they pass away; and repeated defenses of Antifa.

If Avlon wanted to find his culture of corruption, he might start at NBC. The peacock network used to employ Ronan Farrow, who was digging into the Weinstein story. Only, as he got close, the bosses shut him down. He was forced to publish his investigative report and won a Pulitzer Prize .

Turns out it was deliberate. Both The New York Times and Daily Beast had scoops out this week showing how NBC executives tried to silence the Weinstein story. (Just don’t call this media bias!)

Former NBC investigative producer Rich McHugh told The Times that “the network’s handling of the matter ‘a massive breach of journalistic integrity.’” McHugh said he and Farrow were ordered to “stand down” three days before interviewing “a woman with a credible rape allegation against Harvey Weinstein.”

The Daily Beast piled on, writing: “Sources: NBC Threatened Ronan Farrow if He Kept Reporting on Harvey Weinstein.” The Beast explained: “According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, NBC News General Counsel Susan Weiner made a series of phone calls to Farrow, threatening to smear him if he continued to report on Weinstein.”

Farrow said he suspected NBC News President Noah Oppenheim “who moonlighted as a Hollywood screenwriter – was potentially communicating with Weinstein directly about the story, according to the sources.”

NBC went on to have its own internal #MeToo problem with “Today” anchor Matt Lauer, who was forced out in a huge sexual misconduct scandal.

NBC is still playing games on air – in the very same “Today” show. Friday, it spent just one minute and eight seconds on a report and 43 seconds of that time defending NBC.

“Meet The Press Daily” host Chuck Todd on MSNBC blundered into this fiasco by leveraging another story to pretend media bias doesn’t exist.

Todd said: “One of the mistakes we in the mainstream media made during when these false allegations against us for being biased for 40 years happened is we started believing, ‘Oh, maybe we are biased.’ ‘Oh, wait, we can’t look biased.’ So, then, we created a lot of false equivalency issues.”

Sure, Chuck. Sure.

2. Speaking of Blunders: Most journalists know that a too-good-to-be-true scoop seldom is. But they keep falling for them to aid the Resistance.

That hasn’t stopped CNN, as the network refuses to admit it ran another bogus story about President Trump. Here’s AP’s David Bauder describing the problem: “Despite a key source backing off his assertion, CNN is sticking by a story casting doubt on President Donald Trump’s claim that he did not have prior knowledge of a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer to get damaging information on Hillary Clinton.” Broadcast networks went bonkers after the original report, devoting more than 39 minutes to it during morning and evening newscasts in the last week of July.

The key source is Lanny Davis, the lawyer for Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen. Davis now says he was wrong when he gave CNN the information. CNN’s reporting team, including former Washington Post Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein, said on the July 26 broadcast of “Cuomo Prime Time” that Cohen would rat out Trump. He was supposed to tell investigators “Mr. Trump knew in advance about a now infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer damaging information on Hillary Clinton,” the New York Times reported.

Davis first denied on air at CNN that he was the source for this story. Then he fessed up, firing a torpedo at the network’s “scoop.” Yet it took the broadcast networks about a week to carefully distance themselves from this disaster. But CNN has held on for dear life.

The Washington Post published a long article dissecting CNN’s weird sourcing of the story, where Davis provided information on background but was then cited as declining to comment. The Post made it clear that “critics say the practice is murky at best and ethically dubious at worst.”

The result is even fellow liberal outlets have distanced themselves from CNN. Newsweek wrote: “CNN REFUSES TO BACK DOWN FROM COHEN, TRUMP TOWER STORY DESPITE LANNY DAVIS SAYING INFO MAY BE WRONG.” And Politico gutted CNN’s source as well, “Lanny Davis burns reporters. Should they still give him a megaphone?” (Hint: No!)

Trump has accused CNN of a “major lie” and called it “FAKE NEWS,” of course. CNN hasn’t given up … yet. The Daily Caller described its defense as “CNN QUADRUPLES DOWN ON DUBIOUS TRUMP STORY.” Next headline is quintuples.

3. Weaponizing Journalism: It wasn’t enough for The New York Times to claim conservatives had “Weaponized the First Amendment.” How dare those right-wingers expect equal treatment under the law? Now they’re accused of using the Catholic Church’s sex scandal in a similar manner.

The ridiculously biased piece was headlined: “Vatican Power Struggle Bursts Into Open as Conservatives Pounce.” (Note how conservatives “pounce!”) Poor Pope Francis is faced with a crisis because “an ideologically motivated opposition has weaponized the church’s sex abuse crisis to threaten not only Francis’ agenda but his entire papacy.”

This was a common theme in media as major outlets like The Times and Washington Post targeted conservative Catholic media to defend the pope’s liberal social agenda.

The Times’ weaponization of journalism doesn’t just stick to social issues. It has even warned how the Internal Revenue Service “could be weaponized for political purposes.” That’s apparently only a problem when Republicans do it, not Democrats.

4. Graphic Objection: Sometimes media bias is so bad, it takes a lawyer to object. Kudos to the lawyer in question, Ted Frank, director of litigation for the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Frank spotted a horribly screwed-up New York Times graphic about the number of appellate judges confirmed during a president’s first congressional session.

The chart ranged from 15 (Obama) to 24 (Trump), yet Trump’s gavel was, well, huge. “Today, the New York Times taught me that 24 is over ten times larger than 15,” wrote Frank. He was right. It was the kind of graphic you could only make if you are trying to make Trump’s 60-percent increase appear like a judicial apocalypse.",politics
"In one of the more stunning revelations contained in the report compiled by the Justice Department’s watchdog, former FBI Director James Comey claimed he doesn’t remember the moment he decided – and put down in writing -- that Hillary Clinton had committed crimes.

We know that on or about May 2, 2016, Comey composed a statement summarizing Clinton’s mishandling of classified documents, concluding that she was “grossly negligent.” Those pivotal words have a distinct legal meaning, and are drawn directly from a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. 793(f), which makes it a felony to handle classified documents in a “grossly negligent” manner.

Comey used the exact phrase not once, but twice.

Based on Comey’s finding, Clinton should have faced a multiple-count criminal indictment, since the FBI discovered that she had stored 110 classified emails on her unauthorized, private computer server. Other people had been prosecuted for similar conduct that jeopardized national security in violation of the law. Yet, Comey – despite characterizing Clinton’s actions with the clear language denoting violation of the law - saw to it that no charges were ever brought against Clinton.

Based on Comey’s finding, Clinton should have faced a multiple-count criminal indictment, since the FBI discovered that she had stored 110 classified emails on her unauthorized, private computer server.

Under questioning, Comey admitted to the Inspector General Michael Horowitz that he authored the May 2 statement and penned every word of it himself. But then he offered the implausible claim that “he did not recall that his original draft used the term 'gross negligence,' and did not recall discussions about that issue.”

Comey’s amnesia is preposterous. He would have us believe that, as FBI director, he memorialized in print his decision that the leading candidate for president of the United States had committed crimes, yet later could not recollect anything about the most important decision of his career.

The truth is that Comey well remembers what he wrote, because he participated in subsequent discussions with top officials at the FBI about Clinton’s “gross negligence.” Several meetings were held on the subject and contemporaneous notes prove that Comey was in attendance. Those records show that although Comey was convinced that Clinton was “grossly negligent” in violation of the law, he was determined to clear her notwithstanding. To achieve this somersault and absolve the soon-to-be Democratic nominee, the legally damning terminology would have to be stricken from his statement.

Just as Comey, Strzok, Page and company conspired to clear Hillary Clinton, they likewise concocted their “insurance policy,” a scam investigation of then-candidate Donald Trump.

Metadata shows that on June 6, the FBI’s lead investigator on the case, Peter Strzok, sat down at his office computer to cleanse his boss’s statement of the vexing term, “gross negligence.” With the help of his paramour and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, the words “extremely careless” were substituted to make Clinton appear less criminally culpable. Page told the IG that “to use a term that actually has a legal definition would be confusing.”

It most certainly would. After all, how could Clinton be exonerated under the “gross negligence” law if that very phrase was used to describe her behavior? The phrases mean the same thing, but only one appears in the statute.

Strozk and Page also expunged from Comey’s statement his reference to another statute that Clinton had plainly violated. She should have been charged under the statute’s “intent” provisions. With Comey’s consent and encouragement, the pair sanitized his findings of fact and contorted his conclusions of law. Clinton, who had not even been interviewed by the FBI yet, was free and clear. The investigation was a sham.

Comey may not have remembered writing the words that should have indicted Clinton, but he had complete recall of his inability to read the law. He told the IG he thought “Congress intended for there to be some level of willfulness present even to prove a ‘gross negligence’ violation.” If Comey had ever read the legislative history, he would have known that in 1948, Congress amended the original Espionage Act of 1917 to add a “gross negligence” provision that did not require intent or willfulness.

Amnesia must be contagious at the FBI. Testifying before Congress, Strzok feigned no recollection of using his computer to make the critical alteration that cleared Clinton. He did, however, directly implicate the FBI director.

“Ultimately, he (Comey) made the decision to change that wording,” said Strzok.

But wait, how could Comey order a change in the words he doesn’t remember writing? Their stories don’t jibe. At least one of them is lying.

Strzok’s memory repression must be acute. He also informed Congress he does “not recall writing” the infamous text message to his lover, Page, vowing to “stop” Trump from being elected president.

“What I can tell you is that text in no way suggested that I or the FBI would take any action to influence the candidacy,” Strzok insisted.

That is a remarkably dexterous explanation for something he does not remember doing. When confronted with a myriad of other messages extoling Clinton and disparaging Trump, Strzok had the temerity to say, “I do not have bias.” Later, “Those text messages are not indicative of bias.”

No one with an ounce of intelligence could possibly buy the self-serving rubbish that Strzok was peddling. This includes the inspector general who, after an exhaustive investigation, concluded that the Strzok-Page communications “are not only indicative of a biased state of mind but imply a willingness to take official action to impact a presidential candidate’s electoral process.”

Just as Comey, Strzok, Page and company conspired to clear Hillary Clinton, they likewise concocted their “insurance policy,” a scam investigation of then-candidate Donald Trump. The FBI had no legal basis to initiate its investigation into Trump and his campaign. Facts were invented or exaggerated. Laws were perverted or ignored. The law enforcers became the law breakers. Comey’s scheme to leak pilfered presidential memos in order to trigger the appointment of his friend, Robert Mueller, as special counsel was a devious maneuver by an unscrupulous man. Comey’s insinuation that the president obstructed justice was another canard designed to inflame the liberal media. Sure enough, they became his witting accessories.

Compare all of this – that there was never any credible evidence that Trump or his campaign collaborated with Russia to win the presidency – with the fact that there was ample evidence that Clinton had broken the law.

This is the story of “The Russia Hoax.”

"John McCain’s death from brain cancer at age 81 came exactly nine years after the death of Ted Kennedy – and both longtime U.S. senators died from the same type of brain cancer.

McCain, R-Ariz., had been battling the illness for just over a year while Kennedy, D-Mass., died at age 77, 13 months after his diagnosis, the Arizona Republic reported.

Both succumbed to glioblastoma, which affects roughly 10,000 Americans a year and is described by doctors as ""highly malignant.""

Despite being from opposite ends of the political spectrum, the two senators were reportedly close friends. During Kennedy’s funeral service in 2009, McCain read a eulogy in which he said, “The place won’t be the same without him.”

“I admired his passion for his convictions, his patience with the hard and sometimes dull work of legislating, and his uncanny sense for when differences could be bridged,"" McCain told the Boston crowd.

McCain, much like Kennedy when he battled his illness, was largely absent from Washington during the final year of his life. But the Arizona ""maverick"" angered many of his Republican colleagues last September when he voted in opposition to a GOP-led effort to overhaul ObamaCare.

The coincidence that both senators died on the same date was not lost on social media. By Saturday evening, ""Ted Kennedy"" was trending on Twitter.

""Fitting that Senator McCain would pass 9 years to the day since his dear friend Senator Ted Kennedy,"" Anthony Scaramucci tweeted. ""Their fierce patriotism and mutual respect, despite ideological differences, embodies the Washington we have lost and must regain. True American statesmen.""",politics
"President Trump threw his unabashed support behind Tiger Woods on Sunday, a week after the golfer opened up about respecting the office -- regardless of any agreements or disagreements with the president.

“Tiger Woods showed great class in the way he answered the question about the Office of the Presidency and me,” Trump tweeted. “Now they say the so-called ‘left’ is angry at him. So sad, but the ‘center & right’ loves Tiger, Kanye, George Foreman, Jim Brown & so many other greats, even more.......”

Woods was responding to a question last week about Trump’s policies, his feuds with NBA and NFL players and whether the golfer had anything to say to people who “find it interesting” that he maintains a rather personal relationship with the president.

“He's the president of the United States. You have to respect the office. No matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office,” Woods said during a news conference just after the final round of the PGA Northern Trust tournament.

One reporter asked Woods, “At times, especially 2018, I think a lot of people, especially immigrants, are threatened by him and his policy — what do you say to people who might find it interesting that you have a friendly relationship with him?”

“Well, I’ve known Donald for a number of years,” Woods responded. “We've played golf together. We've had dinner together. I've known him pre-presidency and obviously during his presidency.”

Woods’ comments drew strong criticism from many in sports world.

ESPN’s “First Take” co-host Max Kellerman blasted Woods’ remarks, saying it was a “thoughtless statement dressed up as a thoughtful statement.”

He continued, “And it either holds in contempt the intelligence of people who hear it or else it’s just a stupid thing to say. … To say you must have respect for the office — Tiger, be clear. Are you saying that the office, therefore, confers respect onto its present temporary occupant? No. Having respect for the office means principally, in my view, is the office holder should have respect for the office.”

The other names cited in Trump's tweet all have praised the president in recent months. Kanye West, in a tweetstorm heard 'round the world, wrote last April: “You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.”

Foreman, a boxing legend, called Trump “a good president” last year. He said that around the time of his boxing heyday, “We were patriotic. The greatest day of my life was when I put on the colors, representing the United States.”

Brown, an NFL star enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, said last month: “I should be criticizing Trump on every level because he does certain things that call for criticism, but when I look at television I see all these announcers become experts and they’re pointing the fingers and they’re not doing a doggone thing but pointing their fingers, I find myself really pulling for the president.”

Trump followed up his Woods tweet by writing: “The fact is that African/American unemployment is now the lowest in the history of our country. Same with Asian, Hispanic and almost every other group. The Democrats have been all talk and no action. My Administration has already produced like no other, and everyone sees it!”

"A women’s studies professor predicts President Trump’s supporters, whom she calls “overt racists,” will “provoke violence” when Trump leaves the Oval Office – even if it is after two terms.

Julie Novkov, chair of the political science department at the State University of New York at Albany, concludes in a recent article for New Political Science that Trump supporters having political power is “dangerous.”

She defines core Trump supporters as overt racists who view immigrants, blacks, Muslims, and Jews as “enemies of the American state” and are “particularly inclined to embrace propaganda.""

I believe that Trumpers – the core supporters Trump has bound to himself through his consistent and persistent messaging – will not accept as legitimate any means through which he departs from the presidency. - Julie Novkov

The public university professor argues there are no good options for the country with Trump supporters in power.

“At best it might shift some areas of the country back to the political configuration common in some areas of the American south in the 1920s,” she wrote, “when gaudy populist racism vied with conservative, racist legitimation projects for hegemony entirely within the Democratic Party.”

The alternative, Novkov argues, is that Trumpers “could provoke violence and place the nation in the position of having to engage in its violent suppression.”

Whether it is impeachment, resignation, failure to win re-election, or death, Novkov believes Trump supporters will riot when he leaves office.

“I believe that Trumpers – the core supporters Trump has bound to himself through his consistent and persistent messaging – will not accept as legitimate any means through which he departs from the presidency,” Novkov wrote. “Can the Trumpers can be reincorporated into a democratic republic as engaged political actors who accept the fundamental premises of democratic governance?”

She argued that even if Trump finishes a second term as president, ""they will vociferously demand that he be permitted a third term,” adding that if their response is violent, “state violence will be necessary in response to maintain order.”

This fall, the anti-Trump professor is set to teach American Federalism and a public law graduate course at the New York-based public university, according to CampusReform.org.

"Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters clashed in a public hearing Wednesday with Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling over the escalating harassment of Trump administration officials.

Waters controversially called over the weekend for protesters to accost members of the Trump Cabinet -- this, after White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and other senior officials were pressured to leave restaurants amid the immigration debate.

So while sitting next to Waters at a House Financial Services Committee hearing Wednesday morning, Chairman Hensarling called on those who promote diversity to also promote “diversity of thought.”

“I also lament, as I look back, that there was a time in America’s history where you could be denied service in a restaurant based on the color of your skin. Now, apparently, it’s the color of your voter registration card,” Hensarling said.

Hensarling did not mention Waters by name but did address his colleagues on the committee, where Waters sits as top Democrat.



“To all my colleagues, particularly those who disagree with my political views, I don’t own a restaurant. But if I owned a restaurant in Dallas, I want you to know that you’d be welcome there and I’d be proud to be seen with you,” he said.



He added, “I would not yield you the moral high ground, I would not lessen my passion for individual liberty and economic opportunity, but I would listen carefully to your views and I would seek common ground with you.”



Waters took exception to his comments, and responded with a fiery retort.



“Let me just say that I think every reasonable person [has] concluded that the president of the United States of America has advocated violence, he has been divisive, and he has been the one that has caused what we see happening today, where people are trying to push back on his policies and where people are trying to have protests instead of violence but he continues to call names and he continues to challenge people in very violent ways,” she said.

She went on to quote a number of statements Trump had made, particularly about how he’d like to punch protesters demonstrating at his rallies. Hensarling stared straight ahead throughout her remarks.

“So Mr. Chairman, if you want to talk about civility, you start with the president of the United States and you implore him not to continue to promote violence, not to continue to promote divisiveness and then I think he would be a better example and people would follow a better example rather than get trapped into what he is advocating which is pure violence,” Waters said.

TRUMP SARCASTICALLY CONGRATULATES MAXINE WATERS FOR BECOMING 'UNHINGED FACE' OF DEM PARTY

The remarks mark the latest in escalating rhetoric from both Waters and Trump. On Wednesday, Trump said that her “crazy rants” have made her “the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party.”

The days of protests, meanwhile, follow the administration's controversial policies that resulted in the separation of families caught illegaly crossing the border. Trump has since reversed the practice.

"Voters in North Carolina will be asked this November whether or not the right to hunt, fish and harvest wildlife should be enshrined in their state’s constitution.

The ballot measure, which easily passed through the Republican-controlled state Senate in June in a 44-4 vote, has become an unexpectedly divisive issue in North Carolina. Supporters argue the amendment would protect certain hunting practices, but opponents claim it's little more than a ploy to draw Republican voters to the polls.

If it passes in November, the measure would not change state hunting regulations or modify any existing provisions in state law. But it would – particularly the language protecting “the right to use traditional methods, to hunt, fish and harvest wildlife” – help ward off any legal challenges to certain hunting methods and the hunting of certain animals.

The bill’s sponsors say that with North Carolina’s changing demographics and a population shift to cities like Charlotte and Raleigh, they worry anti-gun and animal rights activists could impinge on the rights of hunters and fishers.

“This change creates a situation that in the future could bring conflict between those who enjoy hunting and fishing and those who don’t,” North Carolina state Sen. Norman Sanderson, who co-sponsored the bill to have the measure put on the ballot, told Fox News. “We don’t want the rights of hunters and fishers to be infringed upon.”

In a message to the state Senate Agriculture/Environment/Natural Resources Committee, John Culclasure, the coordinator of the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, said the amendment would act to preemptively halt restrictions like those for bear hunting in Maine and dove hunting in Michigan.

“Constitutionally safeguarding the right to hunt, fish, and harvest wildlife is critical to the future of North Carolina’s outdoor heritage,” Culclasure said.

Many Democratic lawmakers in Raleigh, however, argue that there is currently no push in North Carolina to restrict any type of hunting and fishing and that the ballot measure is simply about Republicans playing politics ahead of the hard-fought midterm elections.

“There are no threats to the right to hunt and fish in North Carolina,” state Sen. Floyd McKissick told Fox News. “This is just a move by Republican lawmakers to motivate their base to go the polls on Election Day because they’re worried they are at risk of losing power.”

McKissick pointed to three other measures slated to be on the upcoming ballot in the Tar Heel State – a voter ID requirement, an amendment on judicial seats and a measure to make the legislature responsible for appointments to state commissions – as similar attempts by Republican lawmakers to increase turnout among conservative voters.

While Sanderson admitted that “anything I can do to increase voter turnout is a good thing,” he brushed off the idea that this, and other ballot measures in the state, are just a way to increase Republican turnout.

“I’ve enjoyed hunting and fishing since I was six years old and I don’t want to have that threatened,” he said. “Having this in the state’s constitution would mean it would need to be taken into consideration every time someone wants to take a rifle out of the hand of a hunter.”",politics
"The wife of a Facebook co-founder has contributed the majority of cash to a political action committee led by Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King that targets district attorney races across the U.S. in a bid to reshape the criminal justice system.

Cari Tuna -- wife of Dustin Moskovitz, who co-founded Facebook together with Mark Zuckerberg -- contributed more than $650,000 to the Real Justice PAC in February 2017, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

The PAC also took in $400,000 in contributions in addition to Tuna’s generous donation, making her the top contributor funding most of the group’s activities.

King, who has recently come under fire for pushing a debunked story about a state trooper sexually assaulting a woman, said his group is working to elect “reform-minded prosecutors at the county and municipal level who are committed to using the powers of their office to fight structural racism and defend our communities from abuse by state power.""

SHAUN KING SLAMMED FOR PUSHING WOMAN’S NOW-DISCREDITED CLAIM TROOPER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER

Tuna’s donation appears to be the only contribution she made this election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission data. In previous cycles, she spent millions on a labor union PAC and an environment group.

She also gave money to the Democratic Party group and over $400,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund, Hillary Clinton’s fundraising committee.

Her husband, who left Facebook in 2008, also used his wealth to oppose now-President Donald Trump, spending nearly $30 million to defeat him, according to the Free Beacon.

""We just felt really compelled to, sort of, get off the sidelines and help ensure that the Democrats were able to win the election,"" Moskovitz said at the time.

The revelation comes after reports that New York billionaire George Soros has funneled so far nearly $3 million into California’s district attorney races, supporting candidates that are in favor of progressive policies, including lower incarceration rates, crackdowns on police misconduct and changes in a bail system that they argue discriminates against the poor.

SOROS SPENDS BIG IN CALIFORNIA’S DA RACES IN BID TO RESHAPE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

Soros reportedly spent more than $1.5 million on a political action committee to prop up the San Diego County candidacy of Geneviéve Jones-Wright, who pledged to form a police misconduct unit and attacked policies that “criminaliz[e] poverty.”

She openly embraced the support of Soros, saying “I love it!"" during a recent fundraiser. ""If he didn't take an interest in this campaign, it would be an even more uneven playing field,” she added, according to the Los Angeles Times.

"A federal judge on Tuesday denied former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s request to move his trial farther from Washington, D.C.

Manafort’s attorneys asked that the upcoming trial be moved from Alexandria, Virginia, southwest to Roanoke. They claimed that potential jurors in Alexandria were more likely to have supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. They also cited extensive pretrial publicity as a factor.

U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III disagreed with Manafort’s attorneys, saying there was no reason to believe Manafort would not get a fair trial in the Eastern District of Virginia. The trial is scheduled to start on July 25.

Ellis previously accused the Mueller investigation of targeting Manafort as a means of bringing down the president.

'C'MON MAN!' JUDGE ACCUSES MUELLER TEAM OF LYING, TRYING TO TARGET TRUMP

""You don't really care about Mr. Manafort,” the judge told Mueller’s team at a hearing in May. “You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever.""

He also suggested Mueller’s team lied about the scope of the investigation and was seeking “unfettered power.”

Manafort is facing charges including conspiracy to commit money laundering, making false statements and working as an unregistered agent of the government of Ukraine. His trail stems from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.

If convicted, Manafort could face decades in prison.

"For more than a decade, a conservative Catholic diocese in Nebraska was the only church in the U.S. that refused to participate in annual reviews of sexual misconduct that were a key reform enacted in the wake of the 2002 Boston clergy abuse scandal.

As a new wave of abuse scandals rock the Roman Catholic church, critics say the Diocese of Lincoln is now paying the price for its unwillingness to change and lack of transparency.

Accusers have been coming forward in recent weeks with allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct by clergy in Nebraska, and the diocese is facing a potential criminal investigation and criticism that it mishandled abusive priests even as it should have been subjected to increased scrutiny after the Boston scandal.

From 2002 to 2015, leaders of the Lincoln diocese refused to participate in annual audits designed to uncover sex abuse allegations and gauge how well church officials were complying with child-protection policies. Church leaders called the audits a pointless endeavor that assumed wrongdoing by the diocese and its priests, but one of the bishops during that period knew of at least two allegations against priests, according to interviews and a letter obtained by The Associated Press.

""I think the closed nature of the diocese made this worse,"" said Rachel Pokora, a member of the Catholic reformist group Call to Action. ""Even if the audits never revealed anything — and I think they probably would have — it still shows an unwillingness to be open.""

The Nebraska attorney general's office has spoken with at least two accusers and urged others to come forward about abuse in the diocese. Lincoln police are also investigating a priest accused of having an ""emotionally inappropriate, non-sexual relationship"" with a 19-year-old male altar server that involved alcohol in 2017, church officials said.

A Lincoln police spokesman confirmed the investigation but declined to comment further. On Wednesday, the diocese unveiled a new, anonymous hotline and website to take complaints.

The scandals come amid accusations that Pope Francis was complicit in the face of sex-abuse allegations against a former high-ranking cardinal in Washington, D.C., and a grand jury investigation that identified more than 1,000 child victims in Pennsylvania.

Many of the new allegations in Lincoln focus on the actions of the Rev. James Benton, a 71-year-old priest who retired last year despite church leaders knowing about abuse allegations against him for at least 15 years.

Dr. Stan Schulte, a 37-year-old chiropractor in Lincoln, said Benton, his uncle, molested him at a rectory sleepover in the early 1990s when he was a boy. Another Lincoln man, Jeffrey Hoover, reported a similar experience with Benton during a camping trip in the early 1980s while he and the priest slept in the same bed.

Church officials said they didn't have enough evidence to pursue charges. Benton has not been charged with a crime, although the two men have spoken with an investigator from the Nebraska attorney general's office.

A diocese spokesman, the Rev. Nick Kipper, said church officials would not comment beyond statements from the current bishop, the Rev. James Conley.

Hoover said he reported his experience to a priest in 1997 and directly to then-Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz in 2002. Schulte notified the diocese in 2017 and said he probably would not have been molested if the diocese had properly responded to Hoover's allegations.

Bruskewitz led the Lincoln diocese until 2010 and was the bishop who refused to participate in the audits, saying the diocese was already following all civil and Catholic laws. He argued that some members of the board that oversaw the audits were ""advocates of partial-birth abortion, other abortion, human cloning and other moral errors.""

""It is understandable then how such persons could dislike the Diocese of Lincoln, which upholds the moral teaching of the Catholic Church,"" Bruskewitz said in a 2006 statement.

Under the audits, participating dioceses must disclose cases of sexual abuse and misconduct to a national review board that compiles all cases for an annual public report that shows the number of allegations and makes recommendations for how churches can improve.

The Lincoln Diocese is one of the nation's most conservative, a reputation highlighted by its refusal to allow female altar servers. Virtually all Catholic churches eliminated their bans shortly after the Vatican lifted the restriction in 1994.

Conley, who succeeded Bruskewitz, reversed the diocese's policy on the audits and began participating in them in 2015 after declaring that the process had improved from its previous methodology.

Benton has denied the allegations and an investigation didn't turn up enough evidence to prosecute, according to a May 7 letter the diocese sent to Schulte. But the church offered to reimburse Schulte up to $3,000 for counseling if he submitted receipts showing where he had sought treatment. Schulte said he felt it was intrusive for church officials to know where he went.

The church also promised to keep Benton at a home for retired priests and said it would not let him help with Lincoln church services.

Benton retired in fall 2017 after new allegations surfaced, and the church imposed new restrictions to prevent the priest from engaging in public ministry in the diocese and banned him from being alone with minors.

Hoover said Benton touched his hip and groin area twice on a camping trip with other boys, when Hoover was around 10 years old.

Hoover said he was disgusted by the diocese response but didn't pursue it because he doubted the church would do anything more, he felt embarrassed, and he assumed Benton wouldn't interact with young boys in the future.

""I probably would have just lived with it,"" he said. ""But as soon as I started having kids of my own, I realized it's not just about me.""

The cases came to light after a defrocked priest leveled allegations this month against the late Monsignor Leonard Kalin, the former pastor of the University of Nebraska's Newman Center. Kalin served at the Newman Center from 1970 to 1998, and died in 2008.

Those accusations prompted another former seminarian, Wei Hsien Wan, to allege that Kalin made unwanted sexual advances toward him and another man when he was a young seminarian in 1998.

Wan said he reported Kalin's actions to a priest twice, after which time Bruskewitz imposed restrictions on Kalin.

Wan said he doesn't believe the diocese has been transparent. He pointed to an Aug. 4 public statement from Conley, which acknowledged ""one report of a physical boundary violation"" by Kalin. Wan said the church was aware of allegations from him and another seminarian in 1998.

""The Diocese has proven itself incapable of handling allegations in a responsible manner,"" Wan said by email from his home in Malaysia.

"Attorney General Jeff Sessions is under fire for briefly repeating “lock her up” during the Turning Point USA High School Summit on Tuesday as the crowd chanted the anti-Hillary Clinton rallying cry. But some media watchdogs feel Sessions is being wrongly accused by reporters of joining the chant.

When Sessions took the stage, the crowd chanted the phrase and he appeared to awkwardly utter it as well, laugh it off and move on. However, CNN broke into programming with a “just in” chyron focusing on Sessions repeating the expression and various news organizations covered it as if he'd started the mantra himself.

HuffPost wrote that Sessions “joined a group of teenagers in chanting ‘lock her up.’” Politico headlined its video, “Sessions: ‘Lock her up,’” and The Associated Press wrote that Sessions repeated the chant. BuzzFeed wrote that Sessions “joined” the chant and dozens of pundits took to Twitter to mock the situation – including MSNBC Managing Editor Dafna Linzer, who wrote, “The attorney general of the united states just joined a chant of ‘lock her up’ at an event in DC.”

Daily Wire reporter Ryan Saavedra told Fox News that the mainstream media “intentionally misled the American people” by dishonestly painting Sessions as participating in the chant. Saavedra pointed to CNN, which played the clip without including the next words uttered by Sessions, which were, “I heard that a long time over the last campaign.”

Other news organizations were more accurate, such as Vox, which headlined the story, “Jeff Sessions laughs at ‘lock her up’ chants, briefly repeats the line.”

While pundits across the political spectrum condemned Sessions for not telling the high schoolers to knock it off, he didn’t lead the derogatory chant or egg on the crowd.

“This deceptive take by the media closely mirrors Trump’s ‘animal’ comment where they did not show the full context of what was being said and used a selectively edited clip to make an attack,” Saavedra said.

Free Beacon reporter Alex Griswold quickly noticed the disparity, tweeting: “I don't like how this is being described. Hearing a chant, laughing and saying it once, and moving on is not ‘chanting,’ ‘joining a chant,’ and it sure as hell isn't ‘join[ing] the call to imprison... Hillary Clinton.’""

NewsBusters Managing Editor Curtis Houck told Fox News that it is “another basic example of how many on the left have lost their minds and seize upon every perceived allegation, joke, or even slight against someone” on their side of the aisle.

“He was clearly acknowledging what the high school students were chanting and chuckled before moving on."" - NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck

“He was clearly acknowledging what the high school students were chanting and chuckled before moving on. He didn't raise his fists and chant along with them or tell the audience that the Justice Department will make sure Hillary Clinton is locked up. The fact that he didn't do those things yet the media are going gangbusters over this story shows how they should stop a few times a day and just breathe,” Houck said.

Mediaite columnist Joseph Wulfsohn told Fox News that it “seemed more like a reaction to the chant than him actually joining in on it,” and lthat iberal media members should be resting easy with the knowledge that Sessions hasn’t actually attempted to lock her up.

“He’s been the attorney general for a year and a half and he still hasn’t indicted Hillary Clinton or anyone in her inner circle. Once again, their overreaction outweighs the latest error from this administration,” Wulfsohn said.

Sessions’ speech included a blistering attack on campus culture, which went largely uncovered by the mainstream media that focused on his reaction to the chant.

“Rather than molding a generation of mature, well-informed adults, some schools are doing everything they can to create a generation of sanctimonious, sensitive, supercilious snowflakes,” Sessions said. Too many schools are coddling students. … There was a ‘cry-in’ at Cornell after the 2016 election, therapy dogs at the University of Kansas. … I hope they had plenty of tissues.”

He added that instead of fostering open debate on campus, school administrations are bowing to liberal ideologies and “coddling students” with trigger warnings, crying rooms and therapy sessions.

Sessions called out a number of schools – including Middlebury College in Vermont and the University of California, Berkeley – that he says have actively tried to silence conservative speakers.

"A federal judge in Seattle issued a restraining order Tuesday afternoon temporarily stopping the release of blueprints to make untraceable and undetectable 3D-printed plastic guns.

U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik issued the order a day after eight states sued the government to block a settlement reached by the Trump administration last month allowing a Texas-based company, Defense Distributed, to resume online-sharing of blueprints for the 3D firearms.

The company was set to allow downloads on Wednesday, although blueprints have been posted since Friday. The temporary restraining order blocks the release until the next scheduled hearing on August 10.

Despite reaching a settlement with the company in June, President Trump seemed to have his reservations over the technology.

""I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!"" he tweeted ahead of Tuesday’s ruling.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters that Trump “is committed to the safety and security of all Americans” and that he is supporting a “nearly two-decade old law” that makes it “illegal to own or make a wholly, plastic gun of any kind -- including those made on a 3D printer.”

NRA Executive Director Chris Cox doubled down on Tuesday, saying that despite what technology is shared online, “undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years.”

“Federal law passed in 1988, crafted with the NRA's support, makes it unlawful to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer, or receive an undetectable firearm.""

In the meantime, Congressional Democrats have urged President Trump to reverse the decision allowing Defense Distributed to publish the plans with a series of fiery statements to the media.

While the blueprints to manufacture a plastic gun using a 3D printer might be available, gun industry experts say they may not be the best options for criminals to go to the trouble of obtaining a firearm. They argue the printers needed to make the guns are very expensive, the guns themselves tend to disintegrate quickly and traditional firearms are easier to come by.

"Democratic lawmakers in Illinois have drawn up a piece of legislation that would give extra cash to schools that reallocate funds toward replacing armed security officers with unarmed social workers and behavior therapists.

The controversial bill, proposed by Rep. Emanuel “Chris” Welch, D-Westchester, would offer grants to schools that use funds meant for school security and instead spend it on mental health services, including hiring social workers or implementing other practices ""designed to promote school safety and healthy environments,"" as The Associated Press reported.

16 other Democrats in the House have backed Welch's plan.

“This increased presence of law enforcement in schools does not necessarily enhance school safety,"" Michelle Mbekani-Wiley from the Sargent Shriver Center for Poverty Law told The Associated Press. ""Instead it dramatically increases the likelihood that students will be unnecessarily swept into the criminal justice system often for mere adolescent or disruptive behavior.""

However, supporters of school resource officers say their role is essential to keeping students safe, especially from acts of violence.



The bill came after a string of school shootings prompted many Americans to call for more school resource officers. Many Second Amendment supporters backed proposals to arm certain teachers after training.

According to the National Conference of State Legislators, 200 bills or resolutions have been introduced in 39 states regarding school safety as of early April. More than half of those measures were introduced following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 people.

In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a school safety plan that would prioritize grants to states that agreed to use the money to hire more law enforcement in schools.

Although there is no official count of school resource officers employed in Illinois, the former president of the Illinois School Resource Officers Association Deputy Kip Heinle said he believed the number to be around 500.

Tony Kim, also known as Kim Sang Duk, 59, was a teacher at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology when detained by North Korean authorities at Pyongyang International Airport on April 22, 2017.

A month later, he was allegedly accused of ""committing criminal acts of hostility aimed to overturn [North Korea.]""

Kim Hak Song, 55, also worked at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology before his detention on May 6, 2017. He was detained on suspicion of committing “hostile acts” against the country’s government.

Kim Dong Chul, 64, was arrested in October 2015 and has been serving a 10-year term with hard labor for alleged espionage.

"From Vietnam to Germany, leaders from around the globe paid tribute late Sen. John McCain over the weekend -- praising his committment to world peace and diplomacy.

More than 50 years after his plane was shot down over Hanoi and he was taken as a prisoner of war, dozens of people on Sunday gathered at the city's Trúc Bạch Lake for a memorial service to McCain.

“His contribution to the Vietnam-U.S. relationship will be remembered.” Le Ma Luong, the former director of the Vietnam Military History Museum in Hanoi, told Reuters.

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel called McCain ""one of the great political personalities of our time” and offered her condolences in a statement tweeted Sunday by her spokesman, Steffen Seibert.

McCain was ""a tireless fighter for a strong trans-Atlantic alliance; his significance went well beyond his own country,"" Merkel said.

She added: ""John McCain was led by the firm conviction that the sense of all political work lies in service to freedom, democracy and the rule of law. His death is a loss to all those who share this conviction.""

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas added his own tribute to the Republican senator in a statement issued in Berlin on Sunday.

Maas said that ""he stood for an America that is a reliable and close partner. An America that takes responsibility for others out of strength, and stands by its values and principles even in difficult moments — and bases its claim to leadership on that.""

In neighboring France, French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted in English that McCain ""was a true American hero. He devoted his entire life to his country.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that he is deeply saddened by McCain's passing and will always treasure his friendship. He added that McCain was a ""great American patriot and a great supporter of Israel.""

Netanyahu noted that McCain's ""support for Israel never wavered. It sprang from his belief in democracy and freedom.""

McCain was a frequent visitor to Israel, and backed the country in the Senate. He strongly opposed the nuclear ambitions and militancy of its archrival Iran.

Other tributes poured in from across the Israeli political spectrum. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman called McCain one of Israel's greatest friends. Yair Lapid, head of the opposition Yesh Atid Party, lauded McCain as ""a soldier with integrity in a world of politicians.""

Officials in Pakistan also offered condolences over McCain’s death, saying he will be ""greatly missed.""

Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a statement Sunday that McCain had ""always stood for strong Pakistan-U.S. relations and a cooperative approach for promoting peace and building stability in the region.""

As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain made many visits to the region. In a visit to Pakistan last year, he said there could be no peace in neighboring Afghanistan without Pakistan's cooperation.

Pakistani officials said McCain often worked to ease tensions between Pakistan and the United States even as Washington urges the country to do more to crack down on Islamic militants operating along the porous Afghan border.

Back in Vietnam, the communist country’s former ambassador to Washington, Nguyen Quoc Cuong, praised McCain’s role in normalizing relations between Washington and Hanoi.

Coung wrote on his Facebook page that McCain was very proud of the monument erected by Vietnam at Trúc Bạch Lake, where mourners left flowers and other tributes to the late senator on Sunday.

Coung says there were times when McCain expressed concern that after he and Sen. John Kerry were gone, a new generation of American lawmakers would not fully understand the care with which to promote Vietnam-U.S. relations, and so he made a point to bring young senators with him on his visits to the Southeast Asian nation.

"Authorities in Sweden launched a massive search Wednesday after crown jewels belonging to the country's royal family were stolen by thieves who escaped on a speed boat.

Two crowns and an orb -- one belonging to King Karl IX, the other to Queen Kristina -- were snatched Tuesday morning from the Strangnas Cathedral, a 900-year-old church located about 50 miles from the capital of Stockholm.

The two men lifted the jewels from locked glass boxes and made their getaway in a speedboat waiting at a nearby waterway, Sky News reported.

""The alarm went off when the burglars smashed the security glass and stole the artifacts,"" Catharina Frojd, a spokeswoman for the 14th-century Strangnas cathedral, told The Associated Press.

The church wrote on its website that the stolen items were kept ""in accordance with the prevailing safety regulations in locked and alarmed displays in the cathedral."" It gave no further details.

A witness to the heist, Tom Rowsell, told the Aftonbladet newspaper he was eating lunch with friends when he saw the two men run ""from different directions.""

""I saw a white little boat and the men jumped in the boat and sped away,"" Roswell told the news outlet.

Swedish Police said in a statement they've deployed helicopters and boats to search for the pair, who sped off in a motorboat into the vast system of lakes west of Stockholm.

""It's 1-0 to them right now,"" police spokesperson Thomas Agnevik told the Aftonbladet newspaper.

Authorities have asked the public for help, while Sweden's main news agency, TT, said an international inquiry for the artifacts would be made in Interpol's system.

""I have talked to someone at the county administrative board that says it is not possible to put an economic value on them -- these are invaluable objects of national interest,"" Agnevik told local media. ""We are looking for a small and open motorboat. We have some different information about how exactly the boat looked.

Maria Ellior of the Swedish police's National Operations Department told TT the items are ""impossible to sell."" The artifacts, which date from the 17th Century, are made of gold and enamel and encrusted with beads, crystals and pearls.

The jewels were burial crowns to mark the death of King Karl IX in 1611, and were later exhumed and put on display, according to Sky News.

The Gothic-style cathedral where the theft took place is the burial site for Sweden's 17th century royals, built mainly of red bricks, and belongs to the Lutheran church.

Police said that the cathedral has been closed so ""technical examinations"" can be carried out after the theft.

"A key lawmaker has ratcheted up the pressure to obtain video of a deposition Christopher Steele, author of the infamous Trump dossier, gave in a U.K. legal proceeding that could shed light on events that led to the appointment of a special counsel to investigate President Trump.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley wants to review the deposition given by Steele, a former British spy, as part of ongoing civil litigation against online publisher Buzzfeed and Steele's U.K.-based company Orbis Business Intelligence LTD.

On both sides of the Atlantic, a multimillion-dollar civil litigation fight is underway. Russian tech guru Aleksej Gubarev claimed that his companies, Webzilla and XBT Holding, were defamed after Buzzfeed published the 35-page unverified dossier authored by Christopher Steele in January 2017. Steele wrote a series of memos which became known as the ""Trump dossier"" and one of the memos alleged that Gubarev's companies ""used botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data, and conduct 'alerting operations' against the Democratic party leadership.""

Steele has yet to tell Congress details about who he was working for and when. For a time, the former spy was a paid FBI ""confidential human source"" while he was working for Glenn Simpson and the American-based opposition research firm Fusion GPS during the hotly contested 2016 U.S. presidential election.

After a long legal battle, on June 18 in London, as Fox News first reported, the former spy finally sat down for a four-hour deposition in a secret location. Fusion GPS hired Steele with money received from law firm Perkins Coie, which the Democratic National Committee had retained. Currently, Steele's deposition is designated confidential and sealed under the Amended Protective Order in Gubarev's lawsuit. Now, Grassley has written that he wants to see it.

In the letter dated July 25 and written to Gubarev's Boston-based legal team citing Fox News' reporting, Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote that ""...Mr. Steele has refused all Congressional attempts to interview him.""

It continued, ""Accordingly, please produce to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary the transcript and video of Mr. Steele’s deposition, as well as any exhibits used during the deposition and all other discovery materials received from Mr. Steele.""

The videotaped deposition of David J. Kramer, confidant of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is sealed as well. Kramer pleaded the fifth before Congress but was deposed in the Gubarev case.

MCCAIN ASSOCIATE TAKES FIFTH OF TRUMP DOSSIER QUESTIONS

McCain personally had dispatched Kramer to the U.K. to receive a briefing in person by Christopher Steele in 2016. Upon his return, Kramer received a copy of the dossier from Fusion GPS, which McCain gave to the FBI.

In a statement to Fox News, Gubarev attorney Evan Fray-Witzer said his client is happy to work with Grassley, writing: ""From the start, Mr. Gubarev has been adamant that he would cooperate with any request for information from the United States Government and so it is our intent to comply with the request from the Senate Judiciary Committee if we're permitted to do so.""

INSIDE THE TRUMP DOSSIER HANDOFF: MCCAIN'S 'GO-BETWEEN' SPEAKS OUT

Fray-Witzer continued, ""Under the terms of the protective order, however, we were required to notify Mr. Steele's counsel and Mr. Kramer's counsel of the request and give them the opportunity to ask the Court to block the government's request, which we've done. We don't know if they intend to file anything with the Court. If they choose to do so, then we will wait for instructions from the Court on how to proceed.""

Fray-Witzer noted to Fox News that Kramer's attorney must be notified about the committee's request for Steele's deposition because ""Kramer's testimony was discussed at the Steele Deposition and Kramer's testimony is also subject to confidentiality.""

Calls by Fox News to Kramer's Florida-based attorney were not returned.

The Grassley letter specifically noted interest in Steele's role in the dossier and his relationship with the FBI. ""The Senate Committee on the Judiciary has been investigating a number of issues connected to Mr. Steele's dossier, including: the FBI's relationship with Mr. Steele relating to his dossier work; the FBI's reliance on Mr. Steele's dossier in applications for surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act; the FBI's sworn statements to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) about Mr. Steele's clients, sources, methods, and credibility; the FBI's sworn statements to the FISC about Mr. Steele's description to the FBI of his interactions with the media; Mr. Steele's post-election dossier work and interactions with the Justice Department; and additional related issues, several of which remain classified.""

""This marks the latest example of how the Dodgy Dossier cases continue to play an essential role in restoring the integrity of our justice system. I'm glad Chairman Grassley and other Congressional leaders continue to get the support they need from these alternative sources,"" former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page responded. Documents showed that the FBI in October 2016 used the dossier in part to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to spy on Page.

Newly released text messages from Steele to then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, first reported by The Hill, revealed how Steele was deeply concerned about Grassley's pursuit of his work on the dossier. On March 7, 2017, Steele texted Ohr, ""Would it be possible to speak later today please? We’re very concerned by the Grassley letter and it's (sic) possible implications for us, our operations and our sources. We need some reassurance. Many thanks.""

Ohr replied, ""Sure.""

Next up for a videotaped deposition in the Gubarev litigation against Buzzfeed and Christopher Steele is Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS.

Fray-Witzer said, ""We expect the deposition to take place before the end of the month, as ordered by the Court.""",politics
"Donald Trump has long demonstrated a knack for getting his political opponents to make fools of themselves. Sen. Marco Rubio learned this the hard way on the 2016 campaign trail when he tried to out-Trump Mr. Trump. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and former CIA chief John Brennan got caught in the trap last week.

Cuomo took issue with Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” telling an audience full of Democrats that “we’re not going to make America great again – it was never that great.” The audience booed. Cuomo was attempting to insult the president but wound up insulting the country and then spent several days walking back what he said. Cuomo’s late father, Mario, also served as governor of New York. He once remarked: “There are few things more amusing in the world of politics than watching moderate Republicans charging to the right in pursuit of greater glory.” His son is evidence that such behavior is bipartisan.

Brennan, who called Trump’s July press conference with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin “nothing short of treasonous” on Twitter, had his security clearance revoked by the president last week. But during an appearance on MSNBC a few days later, he rescinded his comment. “I didn’t mean that he committed treason. But it was a term that I used,” he said. “Sometimes my Irish comes out.” Trump’s statements after the meeting with Putin were roundly criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike, and Brennan was free to add his voice. But a former top intelligence officer who wants to decry the president’s reckless behavior on cable news and social media might want to be more mindful of his own behavior.

Likewise, the political press has decided that its job isn’t merely to inform the public but also to take down the current White House, even if such efforts cost journalism what little credibility it has left. Last Thursday, hundreds of newspapers nationwide simultaneously published editorials attacking Trump in the guise of promoting a free press. The president regularly accuses news outlets of biased coverage. He prefers tweets and rallies to news conferences because he doesn’t trust the Washington Post and CNN to give him or his agenda a fair shake. Trump’s base comprises tens of millions of voters convinced that the media is as eager as the Democratic Party to run their guy out of office, and last week’s stunt only feeds those fears. Journalists who don’t like what the president has said about the press might want to start behaving like objective reporters instead of liberal political activists.

"The co-chair of the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Keith Ellison, was accused of emotional and physical abuse by an ex-girlfriend who said: ""You know you did that to me.""

Ellison responded to the allegations Sunday, issuing a brief statement that said, ""I never behaved in this way.""

The allegations surfaced Saturday night from Karen Monahan after her son alleged in a Facebook post that he had seen text messages from Ellison threatening her and video of the congressman screaming obscenities at her as he dragged her off a bed by her feet, The Associated Press reported.

""My brother and I watched out mom come out of pure hell after getting out of her relationship with Keith Ellison,"" 25-year-old Austin Monahan said.

On Sunday, Karen Monahan said that what her son posted was the truth.

""Every statement he made was true. @keithellison, you know you did that to me,"" she tweeted.



Karen Monahan did not respond to a request from The Associated Press asking for copies of the video or text messages.

""Karen and I were in a long-term relationship which ended in 2016, and I still care deeply for her well-being,"" Ellison said. ""This video does not exist because I never behaved in this way, and any characterization otherwise is false.""

The allegations come days before Democratic voters choose between Ellison and other candidates in a Tuesday primary for attorney general.

Ellison posted photos to his Twitter account showing him posing with Monahan.

Earlier on Sunday, Ellison’s rivals in the race for attorney general demanded that he respond to the allegations, WCCO-TV reported.

Matt Pelikan and former Minnesota House Speaker Debra Hilstrom called the allegations troubling, the station reported.

Another candidate in the race, former Ramsey County Attorney Tom Foley, said the allegations were serious, according to the station.

“If there are records and video of his interaction with the victim, those materials also should be turned over to law enforcement for immediate investigation,” he said.

The station reported reaching out to Austin Monahan and left a message on the cell phone believed to be his that was not returned.

Hilstrom said in a tweet that Austin Monahan tagged her with his post. She then shared it with her followers.",politics
"A former Ohio State University wrestler told Fox News Thursday that he sent a series of emails to Rep. Jim Jordan about alleged sexual abuse by a team doctor in an effort ""to help him realize he needed to step forward and lead [and] cut through the BS at Ohio State.""

Michael DiSabato has accused the Ohio Republican, a two-time NCAA wrestling champion at the University of Wisconsin and a former Ohio State assistant coach, of turning a blind eye to allegations against Richard Strauss, who died in 2005.

Earlier this week, Jordan's office denied knowing about any allegations against Strauss. Jordan did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

""Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State,"" spokesman Ian Fury told Fox News.

DiSabato told Fox News that Jordan's response to his claims has been ""disappointing. The position he took was staggering at best. He chose to double down. Triple down.""

U.S. Capitol Police are reviewing emails sent to Jordan by DiSabato, some of which date back to March. Sources tell Fox News that Jordan had previously forwarded the emails to Chief of Staff Kevin Eichinger and Jordan's attorney. However, an email sent from DiSabato at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday was ""the last straw"" and prompted Jordan to alert Capitol Police.

Fox News has obtained two of the emails sent to Jordan, most of which are hard to decipher and peppered with emojis. Both messages -- dated May 6 and June 15 and bearing the subject line ""WINTER IS HERE"" -- appear to be directed to Ohio State football legend Archie Griffin and former NCAA official Oliver Luck, the father of Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck.

""I BCC over 250 of my VO BROTHERS WHO WERE RAPED and/or sexual prayed [sic] upon daily under the Buckeye banner which you wanna tie your brand ..."" reads the May 6 email, which closes with the phrase: ""#RapeCoverUpAWayOfLife.""

""VO"" appears to refer to Varsity O, an alumni organization for former Ohio State athletes.

The June 15 email reads in part: ""Please Jesus look down on us and save us from the international news outlets who are going to be setting up shop in columbus [sic] and Urbana Ohio this fall to provide daily updates on the most vile sex abuse and abuse of power scandal in modern American history of higher education and organized sport!""

The email refers to Jordan as ""Reverend James – the 'squeaky clean' US Congressman from Urbana, who does not recall systemic sex abuse and has never heard agent orange tell a lie and wants to be speaker of the house despite his apparent lack of knowledge of the systemic sex abuse….""

Male athletes from 14 sports at Ohio State have reported alleged sexual misconduct by Strauss, who was on the faculty and medical staff and published a variety of research.

Ohio State has not released details about the claims but said more than 150 former students and witnesses have been interviewed so far. The school has urged anyone with information about Strauss to contact the independent investigators from Seattle-based law firm Perkins Coie.

"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced Wednesday he will review potential Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses by both the Justice Department and the FBI, following requests from Congress and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

The Office of the Inspector General released a statement Wednesday outlining the start of the review.

“The OIG will initiate a review that will examine the Justice Department’s and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person,” the statement obtained by Fox News read. “As part of this examination, the OIG also will review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source.”

The OIG statement added that Horowitz also would “review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.”

The statement continued, “If circumstances warrant, the OIG will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.”

Last month, Sessions directed Horowitz to probe the allegations of government surveillance abuse, in light of memos released on Capitol Hill by the House Intelligence Committee about FBI and DOJ efforts to obtain FISA warrants to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

“We believe the Department of Justice must adhere to the high standards in the FISA court,” Sessions said in February at a news conference. “Yes it will be investigated. And I think that’s just the appropriate thing the inspector general will take that as one of the matters he’ll deal with.”

“Thus far, members of Congress and Russian entrepreneurs in U.S. courts have made the greatest initial progress in getting to the bottom of Washington’s illegal influence on the 2016 election. Whereas many of these illicit schemes allegedly occurred in part within DOJ, it’s encouraging that members of their staff are now investigating the increasingly clear pattern of wrongdoing,” Page told Fox News on Wednesday.

House Intel Republicans released a memo in late February detailing the DOJ's and FBI’s surveillance of Page, saying the infamous anti-Trump dossier funded by Democrats “formed an essential part” of the application to spy on him.

The dossier, authored by former British spy Christopher Steele and commissioned by Fusion GPS, was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign through the law firm Perkins Coie. It included salacious and unverified allegations about President Trump’s connections to Russia.

The Republican memo stated that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testified that “no surveillance warrant would have been sought” from the FISA court “without the Steele dossier information.”

The memo also said Steele, who worked as an FBI informant, eventually was cut off from the bureau for what the FBI described as the most serious of violations, “an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his relationship with the FBI.”

The memo noted that the FBI and DOJ obtained “one initial FISA warrant” targeting Page and three FISA renewals from the FISC. The statute required that every 90 days, a FISA order on an American citizen “must be reviewed.”

Former FBI Director James Comey signed three FISA applications for Page, while McCabe, current Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who leads the Russia probe, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and former Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente signed at least one, according the Republican memo.

Democrats, then, released a rebuttal memo.

The White House said the GOP memo raised “serious concerns about the integrity of decisions made at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and the FBI to use the government’s most intrusive surveillance tools against American citizens.”

Republican lawmakers and Sessions had been pressing Horowitz to probe the alleged FISA abuses.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he was ""grateful"" that Horowitz had decided to review the FISA application and the FBI's relationship with Steele.

""Federal surveillance authority is an important tool to combat terrorism and keep Americans safe, but it must be used by the book in order to protect the constitutional rights and civil liberties of all Americans,"" Grassley said. ""We need to be sure that improper political influence, misconduct or mismanagement is never a factor when federal law enforcement seeks permission to secretly surveil Americans.""

In January, Grassley and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., referred Steele to the Justice Department and the FBI for criminal investigation, alleging that Steele had made false statements to authorities about the dossier.

Earlier this week, FBI Director Christopher Wray announced plans to “double the number” of agents handing records for the House Judiciary Committee after it subpoenaed the Justice Department for documents on FISA, the Clinton email investigation and the firing of McCabe.

Over the last year, Horowitz has been conducting a review of the FBI's and DOJ’s actions related to the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. A final report on the investigation is expected in several months.

"An American family of three living in the republic of Georgia died during an attack by a disgruntled shepherd, who shot and killed the father and young son, and caused the mother to flee in fear -- until she fell into a ravine and died, officials said.

Ryan Smith, his wife, Lora Smith, and their son, Caleb, were pronounced dead when their bodies were found last week, days after the family was killed on July 4, the Interior Ministry of Georgia announced Monday.

Police began searching for the family last Friday after someone notified them that the Smiths and their son, all of whom have dual citizenship in Georgia and the U.S., were missing. Authorities began searching Khada Gorge, the Dusheti region of Georgia, and found a car and personal belongings in Tskere village.

On the same day, Lora Smith’s body was found at the edge of a waterfall with “no traces of violence.” Ryan Smith’s body was discovered the next day.

An autopsy revealed Ryan Smith died from a gunshot wound.

Officials arrested a 19-year-old man, who they believed had shot Ryan Smith and Caleb with a hunting rifle. The suspect then hid the 4-year-old’s body. Smith’s wife fell into a ravine while trying to escape, officials said.

The shepherd later confessed to the murder and led police to the boy’s body, Agenda.GE reported. He was charged with premeditated murder and faces life in prison.

Officials believe the murder stemmed from a dispute between the shepherd and Ryan Smith, but authorities did not provide further information.

The couple had been living in the country for more than 10 years. They received their Georgian citizenship in 2012 and lived in Marneuli region, Agende.GE reported.

According to his Facebook page, Smith was from San Diego, Calif., but later moved to Georgia, where, in 2011, he started reWoven, a company that creates handcrafted woven carpets in an effort to revive the traditional carpet weaving industry.

Smith wrote in a blog post on the company’s website he moved to Azerbaijan from the states in 2002. He left Azerbaijan in 2005 and returned to the U.S. where he met his wife and got married.

The couple later moved to the republic of Georgia.

Lora Smith taught English through a Georgian government program. Locals who knew the couple told Agende.GE the Smiths were planning to build a kindergarten using their own money.

The U.S. Embassy in Georgia declined to comment to The Associated Press.

"The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department have continued to insist they did nothing wrong in their Trump-Russia investigation. This week should finally bring an end to that claim, given the clear evidence of malfeasance via the use of Bruce Ohr.

Mr. Ohr was until last year associate deputy attorney general. He began feeding information to the FBI from dossier author Christopher Steele in late 2016—after the FBI had terminated Mr. Steele as a confidential informant for violating the bureau’s rules. He also collected dirt from Glenn Simpson, cofounder of Fusion GPS, the opposition-research firm that worked for Hillary Clinton’s campaign and employed Mr. Steele. Altogether, the FBI pumped Mr. Ohr for information at least a dozen times, debriefs that remain in classified 302 forms.

All the while, Mr. Ohr failed to disclose on financial forms that his wife, Nellie, worked alongside Mr. Steele in 2016, getting paid by Mr. Simpson for anti-Trump research. The Justice Department has now turned over Ohr documents to Congress that show how deeply tied up he was with the Clinton crew—with dozens of emails, calls, meetings and notes that describe his interactions and what he collected.

Mr. Ohr’s conduct is itself deeply troubling. He was acting as a witness (via FBI interviews) in a case being overseen by a Justice Department in which he held a very senior position. He appears to have concealed this role from at least some superiors, since Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein testified that he’d been unaware of Mr. Ohr’s intermediary status.

A Japanese man released by North Korea after being accused of a crime arrived in Beijing from Pyongyang on Tuesday and is expected to return home, reports said.

Tomoyuki Sugimoto had been in North Korean custody for an investigation into the unspecified crime, but the North's official Korean Central News Agency said Sunday the country decided to be lenient and expel him for humanitarian reasons.

Kyodo News said Sugimoto confirmed his identity to its reporters who were on the same Air Koryo flight. NHK television quoted a Japanese diplomat as confirming the man's identity and describing his health as ""not bad."" He is expected to return home later Tuesday, reports said.

Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said he could not comment ""because of the nature of the matter."" He only said that protection of Japanese nationals is the government's biggest responsibility.

Kyodo reported Sugimoto was escorted by North Korean authorities and showed up just before the gate closed for departure carrying a single bag. He was seated in economy-class but an official of the state-run Air Koryo sat in the row behind him and watched over him, Kyodo said.

He was silent during the trip except for asking a Kyodo reporter's identity before boarding the flight, the news agency said.

Earlier reports say Sugimoto was believed to be a videographer and was arrested in the North's western port city of Nampo, where North Korea may have suspected him of filming a military facility. Kyodo, quoting an unidentified Japanese government source, said Sugimoto was on a North Korea tour arranged by a China-based travel agent.

The Japanese government reportedly had sought his release through the North Korean Embassy in Beijing. Japan does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea.

In December 1999, a Japanese correspondent for the Nikkei newspaper was detained in North Korea for more than two years on spying charges in Pyongyang. Separately, Japan and North Korea have also disputed over abductions of Japanese citizens decades ago.

North Korea has also arrested other foreign nationals. Three Korean-Americans accused of anti-state activities and detained for more than a year were released and returned home in May. American college student Otto Warmbier, accused of stealing a propaganda poster and sentenced to 15 years in prison in the North, died in June 2017 days after he was repatriated to the U.S. with severe brain damage.

Their arrests had compounded the dire state of relations over North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

"The Health and Human Services inspector general’s office said Wednesday it would launch an investigation into migrant shelters housing children, paying special attention to safety and health-related concerns.

A spokeswoman with the agency said that the probe will not focus on specific allegations of mistreatment. HHS also will look into the training and qualifications of federal contractors who deal with the wellbeing of the children in custody.

The agency announced it was reviewing the conditions of the shelters a day after a federal judge in California ordered that families separated at the border be reunited with their children within 30 days. Children under five were ordered to be reunited within 14 days of the order.

HHS is sheltering about 12,000 migrant children, including some 2,000 who arrived at the southwest border with a parent and were separated because of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy.

Calls to pass legislation that would end family separations at the border went unanswered Wednesday after the GOP’s immigration bill was rejected overwhelmingly in a 301-121 vote.

"Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro challenged democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to a debate, offering to donate $10,000 to her campaign if she accepted -- but it triggered a sparring match online.

Shapiro initially tweeted a video on Wednesday in which he mocked Democratic National Committee chairperson Tom Perez for calling Ocasio-Cortez, a New York congressional candidate, the “future of the Democratic Party,” before issuing his challenge.

“Miss Ocasio-Cortez, I’m really excited that you’ve been elevated to that position and I would love to have a real conversation with you about the issues. You’ve noted that you think Republicans are afraid to debate you or talk to you or discuss the issues with you,” Shapiro said.

“Not only am I eager to discuss the issues with you, I’m willing to offer $10,000 to your campaign, today, for you to come on our Sunday special,” he continued. “We can have an hour long conversation about all the topics under the sun, really probe your belief system.”

Shapiro said he would also debate Ocasio-Cortez for charity.

“However you want to do it, I am more than willing to talk to you,” Shapiro said. “Let’s make this happen.”

Shapiro, Daily Wire editor-in-chief, said that he wants to make “America a more civil and interesting place,” and feels a conversation with Ocasio-Cortez could do just that.

Thursday night, Ocasio-Cortez compared Shapiro's offer to ""catcalling"" on Twitter.

""Just like catcalling, I don’t owe a response to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions,"" she wrote. ""And also like catcalling, for some reason they feel entitled to one.""

Shapiro responded: ""Discussion and debate are not 'bad intentions.' Slandering someone as a sexist catcaller without reason or evidence does demonstrate cowardice and bad intent, however.""

Ocasio-Cortez’s unanticipated victory over veteran Rep. Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary over Crowley's New York seat put her in a national spotlight earlier this year.

Ocasio-Cortez lit up social media on Wednesday night when she appeared on CNN’s “Cuomo Prime Time” and stumbled when discussing Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House minority leader.

“This is painful. It’s Miss South Carolina on maps bad,” Shapiro tweeted in response to her interview.

Donald Trump Jr. captioned video of her interview with, “OMG this is insane and yet the liberal campaign to make her the rockstar face of the left will continue ... let’s face it, I guess they don’t have much else.”

Ocasio-Cortez’s talk with Cuomo isn’t her first media appearance to whip up criticism since her upset victory over Crowley. She has struggled to explain how many of her platforms -- such as Medicare for all and a federal jobs guarantee -- would be funded.

Still, she has emerged as a liberal darling since bursting onto the scene – though not everyone is a fan.

Comedian Lewis Black, who also considers himself a socialist, told The Daily Beast in a recent interview that Ocasio-Cortez isn't the answer.

“The one thing I’ve learned in my lifetime is that we’ve got to get to the middle before we start pushing things in other directions. We’ve gotta get to the middle, and they have to sit down and decide how to do things,” Black said when asked if Ocasio-Cortez provides a “glimmer of hope.”

"Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday vowed to be “a neutral and impartial arbiter” if confirmed to the Supreme Court, after a chaotic first day of hearings on Capitol Hill amid political theatrics and protests from Democrats.

“If confirmed to the Supreme Court, I will keep an open mind in every case,” Kavanaugh said. “I will do equal right to the poor and to the rich. I will always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law.”

Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings started Tuesday and are set to continue through the week.

Before he spoke, Kavanaugh was introduced by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman and attorney Lisa Blatt – a liberal Democrat who said she voted for Hillary Clinton for president but supports Kavanaugh’s nomination.

Democrats, in their opening remarks Tuesday, sounded the alarm about Kavanaugh’s past work in Republican politics, including as a lawyer in George W. Bush’s White House.

But Kavanaugh said Tuesday, “I don’t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences.”

Earlier Tuesday, protests from Democratic lawmakers and demonstrators delayed the formal start of proceedings by more than an hour. Within moments of Tuesday's confirmation hearing kickoff, top Democrats tried to sideline the session with a rapid-fire string of objections concerning access to the nominee's records.

The spectacle underscored the political nature of the confirmation hearings, coming two months before the midterms and as some senators gear up for a possible 2020 presidential run against President Trump. Several of those senators led the charge Tuesday in objecting to Kavanaugh.

When Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley first tried to deliver opening remarks, Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris raised objections to the committee just receiving a batch of 42,000 documents relating to the nominee's work with past administrations.

“We cannot possibly move forward,"" Harris, a potential 2020 Democratic presidential contender, said.

Grassley told her she was ""out of order,"" but other Democrats chimed in to back up Harris, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who moved to adjourn.

This prompted applause from some in the audience, and touched off protests and shouting. Then, after New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker added his voice complaining of a ""rush,"" Grassley countered: “I think you are taking advantage of my decency and my integrity.”

The chaos led Republican Sen. John Cornyn to remark, ""This is the first confirmation hearing subject to mob rule."" The Texas senator suggested Democrats would be “held in contempt of court” if they behaved that way in a court of law.

More than an hour and 15 minutes after the hearing began, Grassley moved past Democratic attempts to delay and finally delivered his opening statement, over the sustained shouts of protesters who were being escorted out of the room.

""Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified nominees – if not the most qualified nominee – I have seen,"" Grassley said.

The disruptions continued as lawmakers attempted to make opening statements. There were 63 interruptions before the break for lunch.

Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch struggled to deliver his prepared remarks, as protesters audibly shouted over him.

“I think we ought to have this loudmouth removed,"" a frustrated Hatch said. ""We shouldn't have to put up with this kind of stuff.""

Grassley acknowledged it was one of the most unruly openings of any Supreme Court hearing, saying ""this is something I've never gone through before in 15 Supreme Court nominations.""

The Capitol Police said they arrested 70 people on Tuesday.

Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin defended the outbursts.

“What we've heard is the noise of democracy,” Durbin said. “This is what happens in a free country when people can stand up and speak and not be jailed, imprisoned, tortured or killed because of it.”

Kavanaugh has left one of the longest paper trails of any recent Supreme Court nominee, having served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office in the George W. Bush administration.

Kavanaugh also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.

Booker, another possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, acknowledged he already decided to vote against Kavanaugh’s confirmation. But he pleaded to delay the vote until more documents are released.

“We should not vote now,” Booker said. “We should wait. And if we're not waiting, we should object to your nomination.”

Democrats have seen thousands of those documents, but say they want time to review and seek more.

“If you will trust the American people, they will trust you,"" Durbin told Kavanaugh. ""But if your effort today continues to conceal and hide documents, it raises a suspicion.”

Democrats have specifically raised objections over how the Senate received 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents the night before the confirmation hearing began.

“This is the most incomplete, most partisan, least transparent vetting for any Supreme Court nominee I have ever seen,” Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy said.

KAVANAUGH HEARINGS LAUNCH AMID PARTISAN FIREWORKS

Grassley, in a written statement submitted for the record, on Tuesday accused Democrats of trying to “bury this committee in millions of pages of irrelevant paperwork.” He called out California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s ranking member, for wanting to search the emails of every Bush White House aide for Kavanaugh documents.

“This would have taken months and months to complete,” Grassley said. “As I have repeatedly stated, I am not going to put the American taxpayers on the hook for the Democratic leaders’ fishing expedition.”

As the hearing kicked off, Democrats zeroed in on the controversy over the production of documents from Kavanaugh’s past work. But as the hearing went on, the Democrats began emphasizing their concern over how Kavanaugh would rule on cases involving abortion and guns.

“You are being nominated for a pivotal seat,"" Feinstein said. ""It would likely be the deciding vote on fundamental issues.”

Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse told Kavanaugh the NRA “has poured millions into your confirmation,” saying they “clearly have big expectations on how you will vote on guns.” He also expressed fear that Kavanaugh would rule to overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling regarding abortion.

“Despite confirmation etiquette, your own words make clear you don't really believe Roe vs. Wade is settled law, since the court, as you said, can always overrule its precedent,” Whitehouse said.

Republicans, though, argued Kavanaugh is highly qualified, saying Democrats aren’t making a case that he doesn’t have the experience to sit on the high court.

“If it's not about his judicial record, what is this fight about?” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said. “I believe this fight is nothing more and nothing less than an attempt by our Democratic colleagues to relitigate the 2016 presidential election.”

Harris, the California Democratic senator, took issue with Kavanaugh’s past work, saying has a history of carrying out “deeply conservative partisan agendas.”

“If we look at his record on the D.C. Circuit, and in his recent writings and statements, it is clear that the nominee has brought his political bias to the bench,” Harris said.

But Republicans argued some records sought by Democrats, from Kavanaugh’s time in the White House, are irrelevant to how he'd serve as a justice.

“The question before us today is not what does Brett Kavanaugh think 11 years ago on a policy matter,” Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse said. “The question is whether or not he has the temperament and character to take his policy views and political preferences and put them in a box marked irrelevant and set it aside every morning when he puts on the black robe.”

Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch.

“My judicial philosophy is straightforward,” Kavanaugh said Tuesday. “A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. A judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.”

The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee.

Republicans command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, which would return to 51-49 once a Republican successor to the late Sen. John McCain is seated. While the hearing was ongoing, former Sen. Jon Kyl was named to that seat.

Republicans have little margin for error, though Vice President Pence can break a tie.

Republicans have said they hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

"Sen. John McCain was laid to rest Sunday — on a grassy hill at the U.S. Naval Academy within view of the Severn River and earshot of midshipmen present and future, and alongside a lifelong friend.

McCain picked the historic site, not Arlington National Cemetery, where his father and grandfather, both admirals, were buried.

Years ago, Chuck Larson, an admiral himself and an ally throughout McCain’s life, reserved four plots at the cemetery — two for McCain and himself, and two for their wives, now widows. Larson died in 2014, and McCain wrote in a recent memoir that he wanted to be buried next to his friend, “near where it began.”

A horse-drawn caisson carrying the senator’s casket led a procession of mourners from the academy’s chapel to its cemetery following a private service. The senator’s widow, Cindy, and his children were among those who walked behind the caisson. Joining them were family and friends as well as members of McCain’s Class of 1958, military leaders and academy midshipmen.

Around 4 p.m., a flyover of military aircraft honored the Navy pilot who was shot down over Vietnam, and held more than five years as a prisoner of war. The burial was private as per the wishes of McCain, the Arizona Republican and 2008 presidential nominee who died Aug. 25 from brain cancer at age 81.

Vehicles that had carried mourners began leaving the area between 4:30 and 5 p.m.

One scheduled speaker at the service, Sen. Lindsey Graham, said before the service that he would tell the audience that “nobody loved a soldier more than John McCain, that I bear witness to his commitment to have their back, travel where they go, never let them be forgotten.”

Other scheduled speakers included David Petraeus, the retired general and former CIA director, and McCain’s son Jack.

As the hearse carrying McCain passed through a gate and into the academy, loud applause rang out from the several hundred people lining the street outside on the hot and muggy summer day. Many held their hands over their hearts and waved American flags. Some shouted, “God bless you.”

People in the crowd held signs that read: “Senator John McCain Thanks For Serving! Godspeed” and “Rest In Peace Maverick.”

Among the pallbearers on a list provided by McCain’s office were Frank Gamboa, his academy roommate; Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; and two men who were POWs with McCain in Vietnam, John Fer and Everett Alvarez Jr.

Tributes to McCain began Wednesday in Arizona and continued for the remainder of the week.

On Saturday, speeches by his daughter Meghan and two former presidents — Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama — remembered McCain as a patriot who could bridge painful rivalries. While their remarks made clear their admiration for him, they also represented a repudiation of President Trump’s brand of tough-talking, divisive politics. Trump and McCain were at odds during the 2016 campaign, and for much of Trump’s presidency.

“There’s a lesson to be learned this week about John McCain,” said Graham, R-S.C.

“No. 1, Americans appreciate military service. ... If you work hard and do your homework and know what you’re talking about, people will listen to you. That if you pick big causes bigger than yourself, you’ll be remembered,” he told “Fox News Sunday.”

“He tried to drain the swamp before it was cool, that you can fight hard and still be respected. If you forgive, people appreciate it, and if you admit to mistakes, you look good as a stronger man. That’s the formula, John McCain. This was a civics lesson for anybody who wanted to listen. Why do we remember this man? Because of the way he conducted his public life.”

The mother of a 17-year-old Moroccan girl who told police she was gang-raped, forcibly tattooed and held against her will for two months recalled how her daughter was dumped at the family's home by two men, the scars of horror stamped on her body, ""her honor lost.""

The harrowing case in a nation where violence against women is widespread but largely ignored has sparked a public outcry, with people taking to social media to demand justice and a petition campaign invoking the teenager's name: ""We are all Khadija.""

The teen, whose story has dominated Moroccan media since an online video was posted last week showing her arms, legs and neck covered in crude tattoos and cigarette burns, told authorities she was released in mid-August after two months in captivity.

In an interview Wednesday with the Associated Press, her distraught mother said she fainted when she saw her daughter's desecrated body and asked whether the girl would ever again be the daughter she knew.

""I was caught off guard when those criminals brought my daughter and I saw her in this condition. I fainted ... I collapsed, seeing her like that, the tattoos, the burns, her honor lost,"" the mother said, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect the family's privacy and that of her daughter, who she referred to only by her first name, Khadija.

""Why did they do this to my child? Are they beasts? Will my daughter ever return to the way she was?"" the mother asked.

Reflecting the stigma associated with sexual abuse in this Muslim nation, the girls' parents initially refused to report her case to authorities.

""But she insisted,"" her mother said. ""She picked up the family records and just went to the gendarmes. I followed her.""

As the mother spoke, rabbits and chickens roamed about the cement floor of the family's rundown home in the town of Oulad Ayad in the Atlas Mountains of central Morocco, a rural region rife with poverty and high rates of illiteracy and unemployment.

Twelve suspects are in custody in the alleged kidnapping and rape, and three are still at large, according to Ibrahim Hashane, a volunteer lawyer who is pressing the case. He said Wednesday that an examining judge had ordered an investigation and a hearing was scheduled for Sept. 6.

In an online video interview with Morocco's Chouf TV last week, the girl alleged that her kidnappers ""would assault me one by one,"" burned her and didn't feed her or let her shower. She displayed crude swastikas and other tattoos as well as cigarette burns on her hands and legs.

The teen said that two men kidnapped her at knife-point when she was visiting her aunt during the May-June holy month of Ramadan, before selling her to other men in exchange for money or drugs. She said her captors gave her drugs that knocked her out for days at a time.

The horrific account has sparked calls for an end to a culture that turns a blind eye to sexual assault and other violence against women, with nearly 75,000 people signing a petition urging action.

In an article titled ""We are all Khadija,"" Moroccan author and filmmaker Abdellah Taïa, criticized what he called Morocco's rape culture and called on the government and King Mohammed VI to intervene. It was signed by dozens of Moroccan intellectuals.

""We will move on. A new source of collective excitement. Nothing will be done,"" he wrote. ""And as always, it is women who pay the price of all the dysfunctions of a society that still does not want to grow.""

Rape victims in Morocco often face backlash in a conservative society where they are often blamed for their ordeals.

In the case of Khadija, relatives of some of the suspects and others have come forward to cast aspersions on her character.

Among them was Houcine Harshi, president of the Moroccan Association for the Defense of Human Rights, who cautioned that her allegations should be viewed with caution and claimed that she was known in town for associating with drug users, something that her mother strongly denied.

Abdelwahed Saadi, a social worker and neighbor of the teen's family, said no circumstances could excuse the alleged assault.

""This girl is a minor. She says she has been abused and raped. Her words must be taken seriously,"" he said.

In Morocco, violence against women remains widespread and a largely taboo subject.

Concern about sexual violence gained momentum last year when video footage circulated online of boys on a bus ripping the clothes off a girl and groping her breasts, among other abuse. Neither the passengers nor the bus driver intervened.

In February, parliament passed a long-sought law recognizing some forms of abuse for the first time and criminalizing some forms of domestic violence. But critics say it doesn't go nearly far enough.

A survey by U.N. Women, a United Nations agency for the empowerment of women, carried out in the Moroccan capital, Rabat, and in some neighboring cities found that 41 percent of the men surveyed believe that financial support justified marital rape.

Over 50 percent reported having been emotionally abusive to their wives, and 15 percent acknowledged using physical violence against women.

The survey, conducted in 2016 and released in February, found that 62 percent of the men interviewed believe women must tolerate violence to preserve family unity. The study questioned 2,400 men and women over three months. No margin of error was given.",world

Hundreds of volunteers from 18 countries have gathered in the northeastern French town of Verdun to keep alive the memory of those who fought under appalling conditions in World War I.

Re-enactors dressed in soldiers' uniforms brought to life a big military encampment in the town and held a military parade Saturday, part of a series of events to mark the centenary of the end of the war.

Visitors could visualize soldiers' daily life during the war through the reconstruction of field kitchens, First Aid posts and command posts.

Soldiers in khaki, grey or blue uniforms, depending on the country, and women wearing Red Cross nurses uniforms were presenting authentic objects and equipment from the 1914-1918 war.

Other volunteers were dispatched on key battlefield areas around Verdun. They didn't re-enact any fighting out of respect for the sites, which have since become a symbol of peace.

Instead, German and Polish volunteers were sharing tips about military clothes and historic anecdotes with their French, Australian and English neighbors at the encampment.

The 10-month battle at Verdun — the longest in World War I — killed 163,000 French and 143,000 German soldiers and wounded hundreds of thousands of others. Between February and December 1916, an estimated 60 million shells were fired. Entire villages were destroyed and never rebuilt.

The former battlefield still holds millions of unexploded shells, so that housing and farming are still forbidden in some areas.

Dozens of heads of state and government, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are expected in Paris to commemorate the Armistice that ended the war on Nov. 11.

World War I remembrance sites and museums have seen a strong increase in tourist numbers in recent years, boosted by the commemorations of the centenary. More than 1 million visitors were counted on the five main sites in and around Verdun in 2016, the year of the 100th anniversary of the battle.

Celine Guillin, visiting Verdun with her 8-year-old son, said the recreated encampment allowed visitors to be ""very conscious of the hardness of life during the Great War. It was hard on soldiers, but also on their wives, their whole family.""

She pointed at a poster urging French women and children to work in the fields during the summer of 1914.

Jacob Withoos, 19, came from Australia as a volunteer within a group of 12 men.

""The main importance there is the remembrance,"" he said. ""War is never a good thing and we must ensure it doesn't happen again. It's great to have things like this so we can remember the men who sacrificed themselves in order to preserve freedom, and definitively ensure it doesn't happen again to any future generation.""

French volunteer Michel Pascal said ""this is modern history. We must not forget what we've been through."" Pascal was in charge of presenting an American corner in the encampment — composed of a small tent for two men, a backpack including mess tin and cutlery and a bayonet.

Caroline Hecquet, a volunteer from northern France, stressed all countries involved in World War I share a ""common suffering.""

""Historical memory is in books: strategies, battles, great generals ... But the memory of local people, it is fading,"" she said. ""People don't know any more how objects were used, how clothes looked like. That's what we want to pass on.""",world
"President Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort is attempting to persuade a federal judge to suppress evidence seized by FBI agents during raids on Manafort’s properties.

During a Tuesday hearing, Manafort’s team argued that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s search warrant was too broad and violated the Fourth Amendment’s ban on unreasonable search and seizures.

One sticking point was evidence seized from a storage locker. Manafort’s team argued the person who opened the locker for FBI agents had no right to do so, and the agents knew as much.

Mueller’s team argued that person’s name was on the lease and they had a key.

The hearing, before U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, was another attempt by the Manafort to hamper the case, after failing in an attempt to have the whole case dismissed last week.

FEDERAL JUDGE WHO RIPPED MUELLER TEAM OBTAINS ‘SCOPE MEMO’ DETAILING RUSSIA PROBE

Jackson did not rule on any of the motions, but rather said she would consider all of them.

There will be another motions hearing in the case at the end of June.

Mueller's team, investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, has charged Manafort on tax evasion and bank fraud charges related to activities before the election.

"Omarosa Manigault-Newman, the ex-reality star and former Trump aide who has since accused the president of racism, on Sunday released what she claimed was a secret recording of White House Chief of Staff John Kelly ""threatening"" her in the White House Situation Room.

But White House officials pushed back immediately, saying Manigault-Newman's termination for alleged ethical violations was handled appropriately and charging that she would have flagrantly violated security protocols by taping Kelly in the highly secured room in the basement of the West Wing.

“The very idea a staff member would sneak a recording device into the White House Situation Room, shows a blatant disregard for our national security – and then to brag about it on national television further proves the lack of character and integrity of this disgruntled former White House employee,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Sunday evening.

In the recording, Kelly purportedly calls for Manigault-Newman's ""friendly departure"" from the administration without any ""difficulty in the future relative to your reputation."" According to the tape, Kelly continued by saying that things could get ""ugly"" for her, and that she was ""open to some legal action"" for conduct that would merit a court martial if she were in the military.

That comment was a ""very obvious ... threat,"" Manigault-Newman told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" She said she had recorded the conversation because otherwise no one would believe her.

""We've got to talk to you about leaving the White House,"" Kelly apparently says in the tape. ""It's come to my attention over the last few months that there's been some pretty, in my opinion, significant integrity issues related to you and the use of government vehicles and some other issues.""

The possibility that Manigault-Newman had managed to record a conversation in the White House's high-tech Situation Room, which is the nerve center of sensitive government military operations, alarmed analysts Sunday.

""This is a HUGE security violation. HUGE,"" wrote Laura Rosenberger, the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy and a former Hillary Clinton adviser, on Twitter. ""Makes you wonder what other kinds of security breaches are occurring under this White House.""

Others questioned why Kelly would have fired Manigault-Newman in the Situation Room, which is ordinarily reserved for national security matters.

In January, shortly after Manigault-Newman's firing, the White House announced a new policy banning staff and guests in the West Wing from using personal cellphones, citing concerns about the ""security and integrity"" of White House ""security systems.""

OMAROSA USED 'STRICTLY FORBIDDEN' WHITE HOUSE CAR SERVICE FOR COMMUTE, REPORT SAYS

In the audio recording, when Manigault-Newman asks if Trump was aware of her pending termination, Kelly purportedly tells her that ""this is a non-negotiable discussion"" and that her firing was related to ""pretty serious integrity violations.""

Manigault-Newman on Sunday called on Kelly to publicly disclose her employee records to back up that claim.

""Release it so the American people will see that I worked my butt off for this country,"" she said.

""This is a HUGE security violation. HUGE."" - Alliance for Securing Democracy Director Laura Rosenberger

Manigault-Newman, who campaigned for Trump and then took a job as director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison, left the White House in December 2017 after Kelly took over.

Just two years ago, Manigault-Newman was described by media reports as a ""top Donald Trump cheerleader"" because of her repeated, forceful defenses of the president. “I’m black, female and Donald Trump is my friend,” she wrote in The Hollywood Reporter in 2016.

“In my experiences with him, he has only been professional. I am aware of the perceptions. But he is open-minded: He does not judge people on their gender or race. He judges them on their ability to do the job.""

Commenting on her repeated praise of President Trump when she worked in the White House, the former ""Apprentice"" star told host Chuck Todd on Sunday that ""I was complicit"" in what she characterized as his administration's efforts to ""deceive this nation.""

Manigault-Newman also produced on Sunday what she claimed was a stringent nondisclosure agreement she was asked to sign in exchange for taking a do-nothing job on Trump's re-election effort after her exit from the White House.

She also suggested that the administration routinely buys ex-officials' silence by connecting them with similar deals to work on Trump's re-election campaign, or with the RNC and other political groups.

""They were not offering a real job,"" she said. ""They told me if I work from home, if I even wanted to work. They didn't really care if I showed up. ... [This] is why Sean Spicer was describing Donald Trump as a unicorn jumping over rainbows,"" she added. ""Because he signed the same agreement.""

Speaking to Howard Kurtz on Fox News' ""Media Buzz"" on Sunday, Spicer shot back, saying Omarosa has no credibility and had broken critical protocols by making the audio recording in the Situation Room, calling it a ""massive security violation.""

He acknowledged that ""everyone who worked on the [Trump] campaign and was part of it signed a nondisclosure agreement to begin with. ... It's nothing more than the procedure she had followed before, and clearly violated.""

Manigault-Newman wrote a memoir out this week called ""Unhinged"" about her time in the Trump White House. According to excerpts in media outlets, Manigault-Newman questions Trump’s mental state and accuses him of using racial epithets.

The White House has strongly denied the book's allegations, calling Manigault-Newman ""disgruntled"" and saying the memoir is ""full of lies.""

On Sunday, Manigault-Newman admitted that ""[Trump] has never said the n-word in my presence, ever,"" but she added that he talks about ""everyone behind their back.""

Days earlier, pollster Frank Luntz undercut one of Manigault-Newman's most incendiary claims about Trump, while also calling into question her sourcing in general.

WHITE HOUSE FIRES BACK AT BOOK'S CLAIM THAT TRUMP IS 'RACIST' AND 'BIGOT'

""I’m in @Omarosa’s book on page 149,"" he tweeted on Friday. ""She claims to have heard from someone who heard from me that I heard Trump use the N-word. Not only is this flat-out false (I’ve never heard such a thing), but Omarosa didn’t even make an effort to call or email me to verify. Very shoddy work.""

Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway suggested the president feels betrayed by Manigault-Newman's actions.

""Whether its thirty pieces of silver or a seven-figure book advance for you, your publicist, your ghost-writers and others, all that’s changed is this book deal and her being fired, so I think he probably feels very betrayed,"" Conway said.

That appeared to be the case over the weekend. Asked about his former supporter's new book at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., on Saturday, Trump twice called Manigault-Newman a ""lowlife.""

After she was fired earlier this year, Manigault-Newman reportedly attempted to appeal to Trump directly in the White House residence, but accidentally tripped a Secret Service security wire.

"A former Democratic congressman from Chicago, heading to prison for the third time, says he has “given up on America” and plans to move to Africa after he serves his latest sentence.

At his sentencing Thursday, Mel Reynolds, 66, got six months in prison for failing to file tax returns on more than $400,000 he received for consulting work.

He also received a scolding from federal Judge Robert Gettleman, who told the Harvard graduate he could recall thinking to himself in the early 1990s that Reynolds had tremendous promise.

“It's a tragedy that you squandered the opportunities you had and the type of person you could have become,"" Gettleman said.

Reynolds represented Illinois’ 2nd Congressional District, serving from January 1993 to October 1995. He was succeeded by Jesse Jackson Jr., who also served time in prison.

Acting as his own attorney, Reynolds argued it was unfair to give too much weight to his prior convictions, from the 1990s, in calculating a sentence for his conviction at a bench trial last year on four misdemeanor counts of not filing tax returns.

Prosecutors say the undeclared income was money made consulting for Chicago businessmen in Zimbabwe, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

In 1995, Reynolds was convicted of statutory rape for having sex with a 16-year-old campaign worker. Later, he was convicted of concealing debts and diverting money meant for voter registration drives into his election campaign.

“The question is, How long does a person have to pay for mistakes?"" - Mel Reynolds, former congressman from Illinois

“The question is, How long does a person have to pay for mistakes?"" Reynolds asked about the older crimes.

At other periods in his life, he had been in the military and raised three children, he said.

“I wasn't just living my life as a wheeler-dealer,” he added.

Reynolds rose from poverty in Mississippi to become a Rhodes Scholar and then a lawmaker in Washington, D.C.

After Thursday's sentencing, with credit for two months served in jail, the Chicago Democrat will end up serving closer to four months behind bars.

Reynolds had argued he shouldn't be imprisoned at all, saying a year of probation would have been the right sentence.

“To put me in jail serves what purpose?” he asked the judge. “To teach me a lesson? ... I've been taught about this racist society ... every day of my life.”

“To put me in jail serves what purpose? To teach me a lesson? ... I've been taught about this racist society ... every day of my life.” - Mel Reynolds, former U.S. congressman from Illinois

Prosecutor Georgia Alexakis had asked for at least two years behind bars, citing what she described as Reynolds' decades-long pattern of flouting the law.

“There are aspects of the defendant's life that are ... laudatory,” she said. “But the good doesn't outweigh the bad.”

The maximum penalty Reynolds faced was four years in prison.

The judge said he hoped Reynolds would use his time in prison to reassess his life, telling him: “It will give you some time to think where you go from here.”

Reynolds, who will report to prison later, told reporters outside court that he already knew where he would go after prison.

“I'm going home to Africa,"" he said. ""I've given up on America because how long do African-Americans put up with this nonsense?”

"Not so long ago, editors and reporters dreaded the dog days of August because news took a vacation. Now the news never stops.

The challenge today is to make sense of the gusher of apocalyptic-sounding eruptions, claims and predictions. Here’s my view of what’s happening to our country.

America is being scandalized by four enormous events that are happening simultaneously. By scandalized, I mean that people are shocked and outraged at what they regard as breaches of acceptable behavior or morality.

That wouldn’t be a problem if the vast majority were scandalized by the same things. That’s not the America we have. The vicious polarization stems from the fact that the country is split almost exactly in half over what people are outraged about.

The first scandalizing event is Donald Trump — his candidacy, his election and his presidency. And, on some days to some people, his existence.

They have a point — up to a point. Trump is unlike any president in history, taking the Oval Office after a notorious business career and personal life. And it’s not as if he folded into the mold once he got elected, though his policies are more conventional that his personality.

Hardly a day goes by when he does not say or do or tweet something that breaks new ground, and not always for the better. His feud with Sen. John McCain should have ended graciously with McCain’s passing.

Still, Trump won the election fairly and the economy is booming, yet too many Americans can’t accept those truths. Their attempts to bring him down define the three other scandalizing events.

First is the conduct of the mainstream media, which has abandoned all standards of fairness and continues to embarrass itself with overt bias against the president.

For the latest example, look at how CNN is supporting one of its anti-Trump stories even though its source, lawyer Lanny Davis, says he gave the network wrong information. So the world knows the story is wrong, but CNN won’t admit it.

Instead of making Trump look good, CNN would rather make itself look bad and confirm Trump’s assertion that it promotes fake news. How crazy is that?

Another scandalizing event is the behavior of some federal agencies. The Justice Department, the FBI and the CIA took liberties that were morally offensive, and possibly illegal, because they didn’t want Trump to be president. Some individuals, like former top FBI agent Peter Strzok, were dumb enough to put it in writing — on government computers!

Although Strzok and leaders of the FBI were fired or demoted based on misconduct, the current director, Christopher Wray, continues to act as if the events of 2016 and 2017 are mere reputational dents.

That, in turn, outrages Trump supporters and others, with the result that among half the country, the FBI remains untrustworthy. Wray either doesn’t get it or doesn’t care.

The fourth scandalizing event is the reaction of Democrats to Trump.

Led by Hillary Clinton, the party has thrashed about like wounded animals caught in a steel trap. The grief does not seem limited to three, five, seven or 10 stages. It’s endless.

Dems’ answers to his presidency can be divided into two: political assassination and political suicide.

The assassination group is putting all its chips on special counsel Robert Mueller. Their hope, their dream, their fantasy — their everything — is that Mueller will find collusion, obstruction or anything that will lead to impeachment and removal.

But with no evidence so far, many are betting that Stormy Daniels is the path to Trump’s destruction. Not likely, but it’s a free country.

Political suicide is the path other Dems are taking, as shown by their embrace of any shiny new thing, including socialism.

The leftward lurch got a jolt last June, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old former bartender, defeated incumbent Joe Crowley in a primary for a House seat in Queens.

In a flash, Ocasio-Cortez was the darling of the party, and some insiders declared she was its future. The movement toward things that not even Bernie Sanders endorsed surged when she called for abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement police, known as ICE.

Briefly, the idea felt unstoppable until cooler heads realized that 1, abolishing the agency would lead to border chaos and 2, border chaos would lead to a GOP rout in the midterms.

Besides, Ocasio-Cortez turned out to know next to nothing about many things. Her claim that unemployment was low “because everyone has two jobs” was a gift to comedians and Republicans.

So where to from here? In Sunday’s column, I predicted the coming months will be nasty but hoped that “people of good will on both sides remember that, in the end, we’re all still Americans.”

Some readers called me a Pollyanna, with Carole Campolo’s letter the most poignant. She writes: “We have always been taught, and many of us believed until now, that our frustrations with government can be adjudicated at the ballot box. This Mueller investigation and the actions by the deep state and media prove that to be a lie.

“With a nullification of our vote, some of ‘we the people’ know we have lost not only our voice, but our constitutional rights and probably our country.”

"President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani tells Fox News two experts and retired FBI agents have analyzed the secretly recorded Trump-Cohen tape and believe it was “played” with.

“Now that we’ve seen the full scope of [Michael] Cohen and Lanny Davis’ deception, we don’t trust anything,” Giuliani said.

The tape, first obtained by CNN, was secretly recorded by the president’s former attorney, Michael Cohen.

In it, the pair can be heard discussing a payment to Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who claims she had an affair with Trump prior to his election as president.

In a phone call with Fox News Saturday evening, Giuliani said he is trying to obtain a raw copy of that tape.

According to Giuliani, analysts say the public audio is a “tape of a tape,” and because of that, they are unable to determine if Cohen cut off the recording in the room, in real time, or altered and/or erased parts of it at a later date.

“Since we don’t have the original, we asked for it,” Giuliani said. “Our expert analysis is done until we get the raw copy, which we are seeking.”

Giuliani speculated that the chances of success for obtaining the raw tape are narrow.

Authorities in the government’s investigation of Cohen are reportedly analyzing multiple recordings.

Giuliani told Fox News there are additional “Cohen tapes,” but he said the now-public Trump-Cohen tape is the only one involving the president.

The others, Giuliani explained, are recordings where Cohen is speaking with third parties and describing his version of what happened in regard to payments to McDougal and adult film star Stormy Daniels, who has also maintained she had an affair with Trump before his election as president.

Giuliani said most of the tapes are secret recordings of conversations between Cohen and reporters.

More to the point, Giuliani insisted, there’s nothing on the tapes that contradicts the positions the president has publicly taken “on all these things.”

Giuliani claimed he would welcome the release of all the so-called “Cohen tapes,” telling Fox News that if Cohen’s legal team sought his permission to release the tapes, “we would say happily, we’ll play it for everybody.

They show the president didn’t do anything wrong and that Cohen deceives people.”

Fox News reached out to Cohen’s legal team to address Giuliani's allegations, but at press time had not spoken directly with Cohen’s attorney.

However, Cohen’s attorney, Lanny Davis, did send Fox News a statement via text message.

“Mr. Giuliani seems to be confused,” Davis wrote. “He expressly waived attorney client privilege last week and repeatedly and inaccurately — as proven by the tape — talked and talked about the recording, forfeiting all confidentiality.”

In regard to reports that a so-called “joint defense agreement” between Trump and Cohen has been severed, Giuliani told Fox News he does not know if the agreement has been formally renounced. However, Giuliani said Trump’s legal team does not share information with the Cohen legal team, and that legal team does not share information in the opposite direction.

"Michael Cohen’s lawyer is backpedaling on bombshell claims he made in recent weeks about his client's knowledge of President Trump's supposed awareness of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.

Lanny Davis, a longtime Clinton confidant who now represents the ex-Trump attorney, had been a source for reports saying his client had information that the president knew in advance about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. Davis also suggested that Cohen had “direct knowledge” of Russia hacking into emails of Democratic power players.

But now, Davis is walking back his statements, telling The Washington Post that he “should have been more clear” that he “could not independently confirm what happened.”

He said in a separate statement Monday to Fox News: ""I take the responsibility for not communicating more clearly my uncertainty. I regret the error.""

Trump’s alleged knowledge of the Trump Tower meeting was first reported by CNN on July 27. The outlet reported that Cohen was present for a conversation informing Trump of the Russians’ offer to provide “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. Cohen witnessed Trump approve the meeting, CNN reported.

The following day, the Post also reported that Cohen witnessed Trump Jr. informing his father about the meeting where they expected to receive information on Clinton; the Post did not confirm that Trump was told the information would come from the Russians.

Trump, following the publication of the CNN report, fired back.

“I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary’s lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!” Trump tweeted on July 27.

TRUMP FIRES BROADSIDE AT MICHAEL COHEN, DENIES CLAIM ON MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER

Over the weekend, Davis clarified his claims.

“I should have been more clear—including with you—that I could not independently confirm what happened,” Davis told the Post this weekend.

Davis began walking back the allegations days earlier, when during an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, he was asked whether there was evidence that Trump knew about the meeting before it happened.

“No, there’s not,” Davis said.

Trump, again, maintained that he knew nothing of the meeting beforehand, and blasted the reports as ""fake news.""

“Michael Cohen’s attorney clarified the record, saying his client does not know if President Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting (out of which came nothing!). The answer is that I did NOT know about the meeting. Just another phony story by the Fake News Media!” Trump tweeted Saturday.

The Post revealed in its latest report that the anonymous source in its July 28 story was Davis. CNN, meanwhile, released a statement standing by its report, saying the outlet was “confident” in its reporting.

On Sunday, Trump Jr. blasted CNN as “literal fake news,” saying it was “Comical” to watch CNN “covering” for its reporters who “obviously got [the] story wrong.”

Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Ranking Member Mark Warner, D-Va., also put out a statement last week that challenged Davis' earlier comments.

“Mr. Cohen had testified before the Committee that he was not aware of the meeting prior to its disclosure in the press last summer,” Burr and Warner said in a joint statement. “As such, the Committee inquired of Mr. Cohen’s legal team as to whether Mr. Cohen stood by his testimony. They responded that he did stand by his testimony.”

Last week, Cohen pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion, one count of making false statements to a financial institution, one count of willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution and one count of making an excessive campaign contribution. The latter counts pertain to hush-money payments Cohen says Trump was aware of. Cohen could have received up to 65 years in prison if convicted of all charges. However, as part of his plea deal, Cohen agreed not to challenge any sentence between 46 and 63 months.

MICHAEL COHEN ADMITS VIOLATING CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS IN PLEA DEAL, AGREES TO 3-5 YEAR SENTENCE

After the plea deal was struck, Davis also suggested that Cohen would be willing to interview with Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.

Further, Davis suggested that Cohen, a former Trump Organization attorney for over a decade, knew about Russian hacking of Democratic emails.

“I believe that Mr. Cohen has direct knowledge that would be of interest to Mr. Mueller that suggests—I’m not sure it proves—that Mr. Trump was aware of Russian government agents hacking illegally, committing computer crimes, to the detriment of the candidate who he was running against, Hillary Clinton,” Davis said last Wednesday on PBS’ “News Hour.”

But over the weekend, Davis told the Post that he is “not sure. There’s a possibility that is the case. But I am not sure.”

“I was giving an instinct that he might have something to say of interest to the special counsel [about hacking],” Davis told the Post, but acknowledged “I am just not sure.”

Davis also told Bloomberg last week that his client had never been to Prague, countering one of many assertions in the unverified anti-Trump ""dossier,"" this one pertaining to a supposed meeting with Russian officials that Cohen himself has long denied.

Speaking Saturday about the coming North Korea summit at the Faith and Freedom Coalition “Road to Majority” Convention in Washington D.C., Pence said he had talked to Warmbier's dad on Saturday to relay a message that the president had offered up earlier this week.

“Today I assured his dad, as the president said two days ago, their beloved son, Otto Warmbier, will not have died in vain.”

Pence said that “the eyes of the world” are on Trump as he is just days away from a meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

The vice president commended Trump on his success thus far with North Korea, speaking of that country’s participation in the Winter Olympics, the suspension of all ballistic missile testing and, recently, the release of three American hostages.

Denuclearization by North Korea will be at the fore in the summit discussions, as will the Hermit Kingdom's role in the global economy.

“After years of failed policies and broken promises last year, President Trump ended the failed policy known as strategic patience and he took a strong stand,” Pence said. “After months of steadfast American leadership, strong words and actions, things began to change.”

"A Russian fighter jet buzzed a U.S. military spy plane in the Baltic Sea on Tuesday morning, two defense officials told Fox News.

The Russian Su-27 jet performed a “safe” but “unprofessional” intercept of a U.S. Navy P-8 surveillance plane while flying in international airspace over the Baltic Sea.

The Russian jet came within about 20 feet of the U.S. Navy aircraft, but the American pilots told officials they never felt threatened or unsafe.

It’s the first incident between Russian and American military aircraft since January, when a Russian fighter jet buzzed a U.S. Navy EP-3 spy plane over the Black Sea.

In that incident, the Russian Su-27 jet came within five feet of the U.S. military plane, “crossing directly through the EP-3’s flight path,” according to a statement from the Navy’s 6th Fleet. The encounter was so close it caused the Navy jet to fly through the Russian jet’s wash.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at the time Russia’s military “flagrantly” violated international law and risked a midair collision. She called it “the latest example of Russian military activities disregarding international norms and agreements.”

The interaction lasted approximately two hours and 40 minutes, according to the statement from the Navy’s 6th Fleet, headquartered in Naples, Italy.

"In an off-the-cuff moment caught on video during a Labor Day parade in Brooklyn Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told a bystander who asked when President Trump would be impeached, ""The sooner the better.""

Schumer's comment appeared to be a sharp break from his own previous rhetoric and that of other party leaders, who have avoided discussing impeachment proceedings for fear of alienating moderate voters ahead of November's midterm elections.

""When are y'all going to impeach Trump?"" someone calls out in the footage from behind a barricade as Schumer, carrying a megaphone, walks past with his security detail in the West Indian-American Day parade.

""The sooner the better,"" Schumer quickly replies. The same bystander apparently counters: ""'The sooner the better?' That's not answering the question.""

""We gotta get a few Republicans,"" Schumer responds. ""Democrats are on your side."" Impeaching the president requires a majority of votes in the House of Representatives, which Democrats do not currently have; removing the president would then require a two-thirds vote of the Senate.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PUSH EMERGES AS NEXT MAJOR DEMOCRATIC LITMUS TEST

But Schumer's office, reached by Fox News, claimed that Schumer had simply misheard the bystander's question.

“After a number of questions along the parade route about the fate of President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, the Senator believed he was being asked, ‘when will you defeat Trump,’ and responded, ‘the sooner the better,’ noting that we need Republicans to defeat the nomination,"" Schumer spokesman Matt House said. ""As he has said many times and continues to believe, talk of impeachment is premature, and Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation should be allowed to continue without any interference.""

Previously, Schumer and other top Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, have demurred when asked whether they support impeaching Trump ahead of the midterm elections.

Asked just last month what the consequences would be if Trump pardoned his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, after his conviction on several federal charges, Schumer told reporters only, ""I’ve said what I’m gonna say.”

Pelosi, for her part, has said impeachment is ""not a priority."" In an interview with the Associated Press, she said ‘impeachment has to spring from something else,"" and not any issues surrounding Manafort or former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.

However, some Democrats have broken rank to support Trump's impeachment. In perhaps the most dramatic sign that the impeachment fight may go mainstream, Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke -- who is running to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in November in the deep-red, pro-Trump state -- has both advocated impeaching Trump and downplayed the Democratic consequences of such an effort.

“Impeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed,” O’Rourke said earlier this year, “and at this point there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed.”",politics
"President Trump on Tuesday continued his attack on NBC, this time over its decision not to run a bombshell Harvey Weinstein story, as he called the network's decision ""highly unethical conduct"" and suggested its broadcast license be reviewed.

“NBC FAKE NEWS, which is under intense scrutiny over their killing the Harvey Weinstein story, is now fumbling around making excuses for their probably highly unethical conduct,” Trump tweeted. “I have long criticized NBC and their journalistic standards-worse than even CNN. Look at their license?”

The president’s tweet came the morning after NBC News boss Andy Lack sent a long letter to his staff on Monday night, saying any speculation the disgraced Hollywood mogul had a role in the network's rejection of the story by reporter Ronan Farrow was baseless.

Lack's letter sought to rebut charges Weinstein and his lawyers had undue influence over the network, and outlined several examples where NBC stood up to the mogul. In each case, they were ignored or told that they would have a chance to comment if there was a story ready for broadcast, Lack claimed.

Lack said he wasn't even aware the story was in the works the first time Weinstein called him. Weinstein subsequently called Lack nine times and sent four emails, ""none of which were returned,"" the letter said.

Lack repeated the contention Farrow and NBC disagreed over whether the story -- which was published instead by the New Yorker magazine -- was ready for broadcast. NBC contends Farrow had no one willing to be named in the story. Seven women were eventually identified when the the New Yorker story was published.

NBC has been a frequent target of Trump’s media criticism, both by name and as part of his attack on so-called “fake news.”

During a July press conference alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump attacked CNN, NBC and the British tabloid The Sun after they questioned him about a reportedly contentious meeting of NATO representatives, and Trump’s then-upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin

And Trump last week suggested in a tweet that Lack would soon be fired for ""incompetence - and much worse."" Trump also alleged the network ""fudged"" the tape of an interview with Lester Holt in May 2017, where the president said he fired ex-FBI Director James Comey over the bureau's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

NBC News' Twitter account shared a link to Holt's extended interview with Trump shortly after the president tweeted.

Trump’s continued suggestion that NBC should have its broadcast license reviewed or revoked was rebuked last year by Federal Communications Commission Chair Ajit Pai, who said the agency does not have the legal authority to revoke a broadcaster's license over speech with which the president disagrees.

""The FCC does not have the authority to revoke a license of a broadcast station based on the content,"" Pai said, during a panel at George Washington University. ""The FCC under my leadership will stand for the First Amendment.""

He added: ""On Twitter, for example, seemingly on a daily basis, people regularly demand that the FCC yank the licenses of MSNBC or Fox News or CNN or any other number of news outlets because they disagree with the opinions they may have seen on one of those cable news networks.”

""Setting aside the fact that the FCC doesn't license those cable channels — kind of an important technicality when one is thinking about these things — these demands are fundamentally at odds with America's cultural and legal traditions,"" Pai said.

"President Trump blasted FBI agent Peter Strzok on Monday night, arguing that the hearing for the agent known for his anti-Trump text messages should be “shown to the public on live television.”

“The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI & DOJ should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see,” the president tweeted. “We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!”

Trump’s comments came just days before Strzok is set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. Strzok apparently was willing to go before Congress, but the committee issued the order for the June 27 appearance because he wouldn’t confirm a specific date to appear, Fox News has learned.

Strzok was involved in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation before he was removed following the revelation of several anti-Trump text messages with his bureau colleague and lover, Lisa Page.

Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz's report on the Clinton email investigation, released earlier this month, said Page texted Strzok in August 2016, prior to then-candidate Donald Trump's election night win, saying ""[Trump's] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!""

""No. No he won't. We'll stop it,"" Strzok responded.

Earlier Monday night, Trump also criticized Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner following reports that Warner, while allegedly drinking alcohol at a retreat on Martha’s Vineyard, joked to donors that he might reveal sensitive information known only to him and Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

“If you get me one more glass of wine, I’ll tell you stuff only Bob Mueller and I know. If you think you’ve seen wild stuff so far, buckle up. It’s going to be a wild couple of months,” he reportedly said jokingly.

“Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller, the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt, knows,” Trump questioned. “Isn’t this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?”

Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was at a dinner for more than 100 guests as part of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s (DSCC) annual Majority Trust retreat, Politico reported.

"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks as an “incident” during her weekly news conference Thursday.

The outlandish slip-up about the deadliest attack on U.S. soil came during a discussion in which Pelosi criticized the Trump administration’s stance on immigration and its claims that the Democrats have been weak on border security.

She claimed that Republicans are actually weaker on the issue than Democrats because they did not implement some of the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations that concerned border security enforcement and immigration.

“We have a responsibility to protect our borders. All of our borders. Let’s make no mistake about that. Democrats have been strong on that point. All of our borders,” Pelosi told the reporters.

“In fact, I said to some of you before, when we had the 9/11 incident and the commission was formed — and they made their recommendations — they made recommendations to protect America, but the Republicans would never take them up. And some of it was about our borders. The Republicans would never take them up,” she added.

""When we had the 9/11 incident and the commission was formed — and they made their recommendations — they made recommendations to protect America, but the Republicans would never take them up."" - House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi

The 9/11 terror attacks, perpetrated by Al-Qaeda terrorist group and its leader Usama bin Laden, killed around 3,000 people in what was the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil in modern history.

Pelosi went on to say that only in 2006 – when Democrats overwhelmingly won the midterm elections amid dissatisfaction with wars in Afghanistan and Iraq – a border security measure was introduced.

“It took until we won in ‘06 — first bill on the floor, H.R. 1 — to enact the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission,” she said.

The top Democrat’s attempts to portray the Republicans as weak on immigration may hit the wall as her colleagues at the party are increasingly lurching leftward on the issue of immigration.

Some top mainstream Democrats, including U.S. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, are embracing the goal of abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency over its role in deporting illegal immigrants.

Congressional Democrats are also opposed to Trump’s signature issue of the border wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, blocking any efforts in Congress to provide funding toward the project.",politics
"An audio recording of the Islamic State leader – who was previously reported dead from Russian airstrikes – purportedly resurfaced Wednesday evening on a website run by the extremist group.

In the 54-minute recording titled, “Give Glad Tidings to the Patient,” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made multiple references to current affairs. If the voice on the audio is confirmed to be that of al-Baghdadi, it would indicate he is still alive.

Al-Baghdadi congratulated his followers on the occasion of Eid al-Adha, an Islamic holiday, and referenced Turkey’s recent quarrel with the U.S. over its detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson.

He purportedly said “America is going through the worse time in its entire existence,” and said Russia was competing with the U.S. over regional influence and clout.

Al-Baghdadi’s whereabouts has eluded captors since the rise of the Islamic State. His only public appearance was in 2014 in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. His last know audio recording was released on Sept. 28, 2017.

There have been recurring reports of his death or injury, including reports by Russian officials last year who said there was a ""high probability"" that al-Baghdadi was killed in a Russian airstrike on the outskirts of the Syrian city of Raqqa. U.S. officials later said they believed he was still alive. He is believed to be hiding in the desert that stretches in the Syrian-Iraqi border region.

The Islamic State has lost around 90 percent of the lands bordering Iraq and Syria since declaring a caliphate in June 2014.

"Brazil won't close its border with Venezuela despite tensions that led to attacks on migrants who had fled to the border town of Pacaraima in the northern state of Roraima, an official said Monday.

Institutional Security Minister Gen. Sergio Etchegoyen told a news conference that closing the border would be illegal and wouldn't help ease the situation in the border town.

Residents of Pacaraima attacked Venezuelan immigrants on Saturday after a local storeowner was robbed, stabbed and beaten in an assault the Brazilians blamed on four immigrants. The owner — 55-year-old Raimundo Nonato de Oliveira — was discharged from hospital on Sunday.

""The closing of the border is unthinkable because it is illegal,"" Etchegoyen said.

Political and economic turmoil has driven tens of thousands of Venezuelans across the border, straining the capacity of small towns in the area to cope.

About 510,000 Brazilians live in Roraima and 12,000 of those are in Pacaraima, a city that has received five times its population in Venezuelan migrants.

Roraima state Gov. Suely Campos has pressured Brazil's federal government and judicial authorities to close the border with Venezuela or send enough help.

On Sunday, Campos requested that Brazil's top court temporarily suspend the immigration of Venezuelans into Brazil. There is no date for a court decision on the case, but a similar request was denied in April.

""Unfortunately it took a violent episode for the federal government to understand it needs to face this issue in an effective way,"" Campos said in a statement on Monday.

She is asking national officials for $45 million to compensate for spending by Roraima state since 2016, when the migration began to reach crisis proportions. The governor also wants Brazil's top court to establish an ""immigrant quota"" for each state so they can leave impoverished Roraima.

Roraima's Attorney-General Ernani Batista said that only 820 Venezuelan immigrants have been sent to other states since April.

""We cannot host 500 to 800 Venezuelans coming a day,"" Batista said. ""Our main point with this request (to the court) is to send Venezuelans to other states and regions in Brazil.""

In a document filed to Roraima authorities, Campos said there is risk of ""bloodshed"" in Pacaraima and said ""the chaos is a result of the omission of the federal government.""

Minister Etchegoyen, however, said closing the border ""wouldn't help with the humanitarian situation in any way.""

The general said the situation in Pacaraima has calmed since Saturday, but no arrests have been made yet.

Brazil's federal government is sending 120 military-style police to Roraima.

Half of that contingent has arrived in Boa Vista, but the other half has no date of arrival set.

Campos has asked for federal since 2016, shortly after President Michel Temer took office due to the impeachment of his predecessor Dilma Rousseff.

A document obtained by The Associated Press shows Campos requested assistance to then federal police boss Leandro Daiello for the first time on July 6 of that year.

""Because of the aggravation of the crisis in Venezuela, crime has risen in Pacaraima and in (Roraima's capital) Boa Vista, committed chiefly by Venezuelan citizens,"" the letter said. ""I request emergency measures for a rigorous control of the entry of foreigners in the border area.""

"U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein fired a staffer a few years back who was allegedly part of an effort to spy and pass on political intelligence to the Chinese government.

The staffer, based in the Democrat's San Francisco office, was suspected of delivering political intelligence, though nothing top secret, to officials based at the local Chinese Consulate, Politico reported.

The FBI informed Feinstein, the then-chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, about five years ago about the staffer and allegations that the staffer was a spy. The source who confirmed the incident to the San Francisco Chronicle said “Dianne was mortified” upon learning about it.

The suspected spy served as the lawmaker’s driver in California, but took on other roles as well, including helping out in her San Francisco office and being Feinstein’s liaison to the Asian-American community in the state. He attended Chinese Consulate events on behalf of the senator.

A former official said that the spy’s handler “probably got an award back in China” for his efforts to penetrate Feinstein’s office and pass on intelligence.

The driver was reportedly recruited years ago after he being befriended on one of the trips to Asia by someone from China’s Ministry of State Security, the country’s intelligence and security agency, the Chronicle reported.

“He didn’t even know what was happening — that he was being recruited,” a source told the publication. “He just thought it was some friend.”

The FBI wasn’t able to charge the individual, possibly because he was passing on political intelligence rather than classified materials – making the prosecution nearly impossible.

“They interviewed him, and Dianne forced him to retire, and that was the end of it,” the Chronicle’s source said. “None of her staff ever knew what was going on. They just kept it quiet.”",politics
"Nearly 60,000 immigrants with arrest records -- including 10 accused of murder -- have been allowed to stay in the United States under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revealed Monday.

According to DHS, 59,786 DACA recipients have been arrested while in the U.S. -- approximately 7.8 percent of all who have been approved to remain in this country under the program since it was created in 2012. Of those, 53,792 were arrested before their most recent request for a so-called ""grant of deferred action"" was approved. Another 7,814 were arrested after their request was approved.

The DHS statistics do not indicate how many of the arrested immigrants were convicted of crimes, nor do they indicate whether charges were reduced or dropped. They also do not indicate how many arrested DACA recipients were deported as the result of a conviction.

Francis Cissna, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director, told “Fox & Friends"" the agency wants to release as much data about DACA as possible for the public and lawmakers to be informed.

“I would like people to keep in mind . . . whatever they do, I would hope that we, at USCIS, would be able to turn down these people . . . if we think they’re a public safety threat . . . if someone is a gang member . . . even if they don’t have a conviction,” Cissna said.

WHAT IS DACA AND WHAT DOES THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANT TO DO WITH IT?

Of the 53,792 DACA recipients with a ""prior"" arrest, more than 4,500 had been arrested on allegations of assault or battery; 830 arrests were related to sex crimes -- including rape, sexual abuse or indecent exposure; and 95 arrests were made on warrants for kidnapping, human trafficking or false imprisonment. Ten such arrests -- or 0.02 percent of all arrests -- were made in murder cases.

Approximately 38.9 percent of the DACA recipients with a ""prior"" arrest were accused of so-called ""driving-related"" offenses, excluding driving under the influence. Another 22.1 percent were accused of ""immigration-related"" crimes, while 12.3 percent were accused of theft and larceny. More than 4,600 DACA recipients have been accused of ""drug-related"" crimes, again excluding driving under the influence.

A DHS spokesman said the department was releasing the arrest data in response to inquiries ""from Congress and others"" for more detailed information on DACA recipients, including DACA criminal activities.

Under the terms of the program, immigrants are able to live and work in the U.S. for two years at a time before they must apply for a renewed ""grant of deferred action."" DHS says convictions for felonies, ""significant misdemeanors,"" or at least three ""non-significant misdemeanors"" would ""generally"" result in removal from the program.

The arrest data has been made public as Congress prepares to consider a pair of immigration bills put forward by Republicans that contain provisions aimed at helping immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children.

“You could be arrested a whole lot of times and still get DACA,"" Cissna told ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday. ""The data we’re putting out is only arrests, so presumably those people who had murder arrests, rape arrests -- that type of seriousness -- either got acquitted, charges were dropped or they plead something down, I would hope . . . there are a lot of crimes on the list we published that are misdemeanors – and they could've been convicted and still could’ve gotten DACA if they only had two of those misdemeanors.”

The current version of one of the bills, penned by conservative Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., would extend DACA protections for renewable six-year periods. Recipients could later apply for permanent residency and eventually citizenship. An expanded number of children who arrived legally with parents who have obtained work visas also would be covered.

President Trump announced this past September that he was ending the DACA program, though a series of federal court rulings has kept it functioning for the time being.

He also revealed his desire for Democrats to nominate a candidate in 2020 who could appeal to the ""great middle.""

""The rhythm of history, of American history, tells us that eventually, the American people in their great mass will tire of him and come to realize that he threatens what is essentially America, which is our values,"" he told The Economist podcast host Anne McElvoy.

""You're starting to see a little of that with the treatment of children at the border, but if history is a guide, and I believe it is, the American people will tire of the show, and come to see that whatever trade they convinced themselves was worth it to elect such a person, it isn't in the long run worth it to trade our values for the rhetoric, the promises of a particular person like that,"" Comey said.

Comey said he wanted to be part of a conversation to ""awaken the giant"" and have the American people realize a threat to their values ""transcends politics.""

"Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired back Thursday at President Trump for saying he “never took control of the Justice Department,” putting out a sharp statement vowing the agency won’t be “improperly influenced” by politics.

Trump had made the comments in a wide-ranging interview with “Fox & Friends.” The president, on the heels of the first guilty verdict from a trial connected to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe, continued to fume over Sessions' recusal from the Russia investigation.

""Jeff Sessions never took control of the Justice Department, and it's a sort of an incredible thing,"" Trump claimed.

But Sessions countered in a written statement:

“I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President’s agenda—one that protects the safety and security rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty.”

He went on to say, “While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.”

'While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.' - Attorney General Jeff Sessions

The statement was released shortly before he joined Trump at the White House for a meeting on prison reform legislation. “We're pleased the President agreed that we shouldn't support criminal justice reform that would reduce sentences, put drug traffickers back on our streets, and undermine our law enforcement officers who are working night and day to reduce violent crime and drug trafficking in the middle of an opioid crisis,” Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said after the meeting.

The president for months has railed against Sessions over his recusal, but the attorney general has hung on, occasionally pushing back publicly. The president discussed Sessions when asked in the Fox News interview if he would fire his AG and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after the midterms.

He didn’t rule it out, but said he wanted to stay “uninvolved.”

“But when everybody sees what’s going on in the Justice Department—I always put ‘justice’ now with quotes—it’s a very, very sad day. Jeff Sessions recused himself, which he shouldn’t have done. Or he should have told me,” Trump told Ainsley Earhardt. “Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you wouldn’t have put him in. He took the job and then he said I’m going to recuse myself. I said, ‘what kind of a man is this?’”

Trump also said that the “only reason” he appointed Sessions as attorney general was because he worked on his 2016 campaign.

“Because I felt loyalty, he was an original supporter. He was on the campaign. He knows there was no collusion,” Trump explained. “And what’s come out of Manafort? No collusion. What’s come out of Michael Cohen? No collusion.”

Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted on eight financial crime counts earlier this week, arising out of the Mueller probe. His ex-attorney Cohen also struck a plea deal in a separate case.

Sessions recused himself in 2017, due to his involvement with the Trump campaign, per Justice Department regulations.

Rosenstein, his deputy, was then named to oversee the investigation. He appointed Mueller as special counsel.

Earlier this summer, Trump blamed Sessions for the ongoing “Russian Witch Hunt Hoax,” again saying he “would have picked someone else” as the nation’s chief law officer if he knew of Sessions’ decision to recuse himself, concluding: “And I wish I did!”

But despite Trump’s consistent criticisms and Sessions’ recusal from the Russia investigation, the attorney general has led the charge on a number of items on the president’s agenda.

Just this week, Sessions announced developments in combating the opioid crisis, warning drug companies, foreign nationals and drug traffickers that the Justice Department “will use civil and criminal penalties alike”.

“We will find you, put you in jail, or make you pay,” Sessions said in a speech Wednesday in Cleveland, Ohio.

Sessions’ Justice Department also has focused on immigration enforcement, with an announcement just this week that the agency denaturalized a war criminal who had fraudulently obtained refugee status and U.S. citizenship.

The Justice Department has focused as well on campus free speech, violent crime and religious freedom.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Thursday that despite Sessions’ accomplishments, he believes it “very likely” Trump will appoint a new attorney general.

“The president is entitled to an attorney general he has faith in, somebody that’s qualified for the job and I think there will become a time sooner rather than later where it will be time to have a new face, and fresh voice, at the Department of Justice,” Graham said. “Clearly, Attorney General Sessions doesn’t have the confidence of the president and all I can say is that I have a lot of respect for the attorney general, but that’s an important office in the country and after the election, I think there will be some serious discussions about a new attorney general.”

Graham added, though, that “replacing [Sessions], to me, before the election would be a non-starter.”

"When the Senate Judiciary Committee begins its confirmation hearing Tuesday on Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court we can expect to see Democrats wage an all-out battle to keep the extraordinarily qualified judge off the nation’s highest court.

Long before the hearing, Democrats launched a scorched-earth campaign against President Trump’s nomination of the judge, who currently serves on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

Hillary Shelton of the NAACP declared that Kavanaugh is a “dangerous criminal.” Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., warned that Kavanaugh “wants to pave the path to tyranny.” Sen. Cory Booker, D-N. J., called the judge’s nomination “alarming.”

This wildly inaccurate and hysterical rhetoric is little more than political grandstanding.

“I don’t think any Democrat is going to go along with a Trump appointee to the Supreme Court,” said Democratic strategist Paul Begala. “Not if he or she wants to raise any money or have any volunteers.”

Notwithstanding the partisan pressure to grandstand, it is unconscionable to demonize this father of two who serves meals at Catholic charities and tutors at a local elementary school.

Kavanaugh is eminently qualified when we evaluate him on his legal credentials, judicial philosophy and personal character. These are the three criteria by which Americans have traditionally assessed Supreme Court nominees.

First, Kavanaugh’s legal credentials are impeccable.

Kavanaugh earned his law degree from Yale University and was a law clerk for recently retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose seat he will fill if confirmed.

The Supreme Court nominee was an attorney on the staff of Independent Counsel Ken Starr and played a key role in writing the report that called for impeaching President Clinton. He worked in the White House Counsel’s Office and was later White House staff secretary for President George W. Bush. He was a partner in a law firm. He has served on the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington since 2006.

Within days of his nomination to the Supreme Court in July by President Trump, statements of support came pouring in from lawyers and others around the country describing Kavanaugh as impeccably qualified.

As Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has made clear, the bizarre request by Democrats for millions of pages of presidential documents from Kavanaugh’s tenure in the White House proves that Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are desperate.

Second, Kavanaugh’s judicial philosophy is faithful to the Founding Father’s vision.

As numerous legal scholars have noted, Kavanaugh’s legal opinions and occasional writings coalesce to provide a clear picture of his judicial philosophy, especially his view that a judge’s role is to be an “umpire” rather than a “player.”

As Chief Justice John Roberts once put it: “Judges are like umpires. Umpires don’t make the rules; they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules. But it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire.”

This aspect of Kavanaugh’s judicial philosophy is so important because, sadly, in recent years many federal judges have embraced a “living document” view of the Constitution. This progressive view encourages judges to view themselves as players rather than umpires.

The “living document” view contends that judges have the right to reinterpret the Constitution in light of “the times.” Its overall effect is that a Supreme Court majority can remove things from the Constitution that justices do not like and insert things they do.

The “living document” view enabled the Supreme Court to issue its Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 legalizing abortion nationwide and its Obergefell v. Hodges decision in 2015 that said same-sex couples have the right to marry.

In response to the “living document” view, the conservative view is that members of the Supreme Court do not have the right to revise the Constitution. Although the Constitution may need to be revised from time to time, America’s Founding Fathers made clear that an amendment to the Constitution must reflect the will of the people. An amendment requires an overwhelming congressional majority and ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures.

Kavanaugh – like Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia before him – rejects the “living document” view. He would refrain from the type of judicial activism that bypasses the American people.

Third, Kavanaugh’s personal character meets the high standard necessary for serving on the high court.

Any number of character attributes are desirable in Supreme Court justices. We want them to be conscientious because we know that it takes hard work and perseverance to adjudicate complex legal issues. Similarly, we want our justices to be wise and discerning rather than simplistic or superficial.

Perhaps most importantly, we want our justices to be trustworthy, to be the type of people who can’t be “bought off” by corporations or unduly influenced by partisan politicians.

By all serious accounts, Kavanaugh is just such a person.

In Washington, Kavanaugh is known not only for his legal prowess, but also for serving meals to the homeless and tutoring underprivileged children.

He has received vigorous bipartisan support from more than 160 members of the Yale community, who wrote that Kavanaugh “is a person of deep conviction and integrity.”

Kavanaugh has even garnered support from prominent liberals such as Lisa Blatt, a feminist lawyer who worked in the Clinton and Obama administrations but declared that Kavanaugh is “supremely qualified.”

In light of Kavanaugh’s impeccable legal credentials, judicial philosophy, and personal character – along with the robust bipartisan support he’s received from legal experts around the nation – let’s hope that good-thinking Democratic senators such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia will find a way to extricate themselves from the grandstanding so prevalent in their party and support Kavanaugh’s nomination.

Any Democrat who votes to confirm Kavanaugh will have an opportunity to eschew partisan grandstanding and send a message to the nation that Supreme Court justices should be evaluated on their merits.",politics
"EXCLUSIVE: The government’s star witness in the case against ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort “deserves a special place in Hell,” one of the jurors told Fox News in an exclusive interview, while revealing the jury largely discounted his testimony during the dramatic trial.

Juror Paula Duncan gave a behind-the-scenes account to Fox News on Wednesday, after the jury returned a guilty verdict against the former Trump campaign chairman on eight financial crime counts and deadlocked on 10 others. She revealed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team was one holdout juror away from winning a conviction against Manafort on all 18 counts.

But Duncan, who described herself as an avid supporter of President Trump, said she ultimately considered Manafort guilty of the charges against him despite her misgivings about the case itself.

Still, she panned the prosecution’s star witness Rick Gates, the defendant's former business partner, as “nervous” and doing whatever he could to save himself.

MANAFORT JUROR REVEALS LONE HOLDOUT PREVENTED CONVICTION ON ALL COUNTS

“He deserves a special place in Hell,” she said. “He was just as guilty as Paul Manafort, maybe even more. I mean he embezzled from his employer.”

During the trial, Gates testified that he and Manafort conspired to commit bank and tax fraud – while also admitting he embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from his former business partner.

Duncan pointed to the paper trail, not Gates’ testimony, as the key component in the jury’s decision.

In a separate interview with Shannon Bream on “Fox News @ Night,” Duncan said some jurors had issues with Gates’ testimony from the outset because he took a plea deal.

“So we agreed to throw out his testimony and look at the paperwork, which his name was all over,” she said, adding that they did not find him credible. “I think he would have done anything that he could to preserve himself. That's just obvious in the fact that he flipped on Manafort.”

Duncan is the first Manafort juror to speak publicly about the trial. In her interviews, she revealed other details about the four tense and emotional days of deliberations that led to the guilty verdict on eight counts.

Behind closed doors, tempers flared at times, even though jurors never explicitly discussed Manafort’s close ties to Trump.

“It was a very emotionally charged jury room – there were some tears,” Duncan said about deliberations with a group of Virginians she didn’t feel included many “fellow Republicans.”

A political allegiance to the president also raised conflicted feelings in Duncan, but she said it ultimately didn’t change her decision about the former Trump campaign chairman.

“Finding Mr. Manafort guilty was hard for me. I wanted him to be innocent, I really wanted him to be innocent, but he wasn’t,” Duncan said. “That’s the part of a juror, you have to have due diligence and deliberate and look at the evidence and come up with an informed and intelligent decision, which I did.”

During the trial, Judge T.S. Ellis III made headlines for his repeated rebukes of the prosecution, dating back to when he claimed earlier this year they really only cared about what information they could get from the defendant about Trump.

Asked if she agreed with that characterization, Duncan said it was “spot on.”

She echoed Trump in calling the special counsel probe a “witch hunt.” But she said Manafort was guilty all the same, of crimes pertaining to hiding income earned from his political consulting work overseas and other fraud counts.

“Certainly Mr. Manafort got caught breaking the law, but he wouldn’t have gotten caught if they weren’t after President Trump,” Duncan said.

"West Virginia lawmakers, seeking to remove every justice on the state's four-member Supreme Court amid what they called an ""over-the-top"" spending scandal, impeached three justices on Monday, including Chief Justice Margaret Workman.

One article of impeachment said Workman and Justice Robin Davis signed documents in their roles as chief justices allowing for senior status judges to be paid higher than allowed wages. Lawmakers say the overpayments violated state law and stopped when they were challenged by the Internal Revenue Service.

Earlier Monday, the Republican-led House of Delegates voted 64-33 to send an impeachment article against Davis to the state Senate for trial. The vote came shortly after lawmakers also impeached indicted Justice Allen Loughry by a vote of 64-33. Loughry's impeachment vote, which came after approximately two hours of debate, took only seconds, NPR reported.

Other articles are under consideration. Justice Beth Walker is the only current justice who has not been impeached as of Monday evening.

Walker was cleared late Monday of an impeachment article for spending $131,000 on renovations after taking office last year. She still faces another article that accuses her and the three other justices of abusing their authority by failing to control office expenses and not maintaining policies over critical matters. Some lawmakers said they didn't condone Walker's spending but said it paled in comparison to other justices.

The impeachments do not remove the justices from office. The articles will go to the Senate, which can formally remove the justices only by a two-thirds vote.

The charges were largely related to the justices' use of state funds to conduct office renovations. Davis spent more than $500,000 on her office and Loughry spent more than $363,000 on his.

Loughry is under federal indictment and named in eight impeachment articles, including allegations he lied about taking home a $42,000 antique desk and a $32,000 suede leather couch.

On Monday, Loughry was impeached under six impeachment articles, including for allegedly driving state vehicles for personal use and of using state-owned computers at his home. He was also impeached for his role in assuring higher pay for senior status judges.

Republican Delegate Tom Fast of Fayette County said he had seen the work done in Davis' office, including track lighting on the floor. He characterized the renovations as ""over-the-top"" and said the impeachment article ""is one of the more easy ones"" for him to support.

However, some legislators said they didn't support impeaching any justice for wasteful spending, only for articles pertaining to lying, cheating or stealing.

Several lawmakers noted that the Supreme Court has a separate budget and is currently allowed to spend as it sees fit. A proposed constitutional amendment this fall would bring the state courts' budget partly under legislative control.

But State GOP Delegate John Shott, who helped draw up the impeachment articles, said that if West Virginians do not trust their highest court, ""we need to take action to try to rebuild that trust.""

Normally, West Virginia has five Supreme Court justices who are elected to serve a 12-year term. However, Menis E. Ketchum resigned from the state Supreme Court in July after he was accused of alleged federal wire fraud. He pleaded guilty to a felony charge of defrauding the state and faces up to 20 years in prison.

"ISIS claimed responsibility Wednesday for the deadly Toronto shooting and investigators are reportedly digging into the gunman's past and Internet history -- but Canadian officials continue to insist the killings aren't related to terrorism, clouding the possible motive for the attack that killed two and wounded 13.

Continue Reading Below

The terror group's AMAQ propaganda agency, citing a ""security source,"" said Toronto shooter Faisal Hussain, 29, was a ""soldier of the Islamic State and carried out the attack in response to calls to target the citizens of the coalition countries."" Based on language used in previous claims by ISIS, it appeared the shrinking Islamist group looked at Hussain as having been merely inspired by ISIS, rather than having been directed.

The group did not provide further details or any evidence, such as a videotaped pledge of allegiance, for its claim. Hussain, who killed 10-year-old Julianna Kozis and 18-year-old Reese Fallon during the mass shooting, died after a gun battle with police late Sunday.

On Wednesday, Canadian officials stressed there was no national security risk despite authorities' continued investigation into what prompted the deadly rampage in the bustling Greektown neighborhood.

""These are the early stages‎ of an active investigation being led by the Toronto Police Service,"" a spokesperson from Canada's Office of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness told Fox News. ""At this time, there is no national security nexus.""

But while officials are publicly pushing back on any ties to terror for now, reports have emerged that investigators are questioning Hussain's past.

Hussain had visited ISIS websites and may have expressed support for the terrorist group, CBS News and the Toronto Sun reported, citing law enforcement sources. A law enforcement source told the Toronto Sun the 29-year-old expressed “support” for a website that was seen as “pro"" ISIS.

Officials are also investigating if Hussain lived at one time in Afghanistan or possibly Pakistan, CBS News reported.

Hussain's online activities have previously drawn the attention of law enforcement, and he was “well known to Toronto Police” for investigations into past crimes “involving weapons and violence,"" according to the Toronto Sun.

TORONTO MASS SHOOTING SUSPECT WAS KNOWN TO POLICE DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, REPORT SAYS

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders pushed back on those reports on Wednesday, saying there is so far no evidence of ISIS support and that that ""every investigative avenue"" is being examined.

“Since Sunday evening, all areas of the Toronto Police Service have been involved in this investigation. We have received assistance from law enforcement partners at every level and I have been updated regularly. At this stage, we have no evidence to support these claims,"" Saunders said in a statement. ""Accurate information about this investigation will only be released by the Toronto Police Service. We will continue to explore every investigative avenue including interviewing those who knew Mr. Hussain, reviewing his online activity, and looking into his experiences with mental health.”

The gunman's family has maintained their son had a long history of psychosis and depression and had not responded to numerous treatment approaches, including therapy and medication.

""While we did our best to seek help for him throughout his life of struggle and pain, we could never imagine that this would be his devastating and destructive end,"" the family said in a statement. ""Our hearts are in pieces for the victims and for our city as we all come to grips with this terrible tragedy. We will mourn those who were lost for the rest of our lives.""

Canada's Global News reported Tuesday that Hussain had been taken into police custody twice due to concerns about his mental health. The Global News report did not specify when Toronto police had encountered Hussain, but said he had a history of mental health concerns dating back to 2010. The report also did not say what happened after police apprehended Hussain.

TORONTO SHOOTING SUSPECT IDENTIFIED AS FAISAL HUSSAIN, FAMILY SAYS HE HAD 'SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES'

A police source told Global News that Hussain believed he was the Joker character from the ""Batman"" movies. The source added Hussain ""was fascinated with death and explosions. He also liked replica handguns."" A family spokesman confirmed to Global News that Hussain owned a replica BB gun, but denied he had any special obsession with the Batman movies or any particular character.

Investigators searched the low-income apartment Hussain shared with his parents and siblings on Thorncliffe Park Drive in the eastern part of the city, and removed boxes filled with potential evidence overnight, according to the Associated Press.

An autopsy on Hussain was expected Tuesday, and officials have not yet disclosed where Hussain got the handgun used in the attack.

"Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch tipped the scales on another landmark decision on Wednesday, joining the conservative majority for the 5-4 ruling against so-called ""fair share"" union fees.

It was the latest example of President Trump's nominee delivering a win for the administration's agenda and conservative causes, coming on the heels of the 5-4 ruling upholding Trump's ""travel ban.""

In the union case, Gorsuch's impact was strikingly evident.

Justices split 4-4 on the issue in a similar case following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. After Gorsuch was confirmed to fill the seat, he played it close to the vest during arguments in February -- offering no comments or questions from the bench during nearly 70 minutes of oral arguments.

But in the end, Gorsuch sided with a conservative majority ruling that state government workers cannot be forced to pay “fair share” fees to support collective bargaining and other union activities.

The decision, which dealt a blow to unions, said that a union’s contract negotiations over pay and benefits were inextricably linked with its broader political activities, and concluded workers had a limited constitutional right not to underwrite such “speech.”

The case specifically examined union fees paid by non-members.

“The procedure violates the First Amendment and cannot continue,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion. “Neither an agency fee nor any other payment to the union may be deducted from a nonmembers wages, nor may any other attempt be made to collect such a payment, unless the employee affirmatively consents to pay.”

The court now ends its session with Gorsuch's impact on full display.

Gorsuch also sided with conservative justices this week to uphold Trump’s so-called travel ban — the first major high court decision on a Trump administration policy. The 5-4 ruling upheld selective travel restrictions for certain Muslim majority countries. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the order was “squarely within the scope of presidential authority” under federal law.

Liberal justices and advocates lamented the outcome of both the travel ban and union cases.

On the former, Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested the policy remained discriminatory: “Based on the evidence in the record, a reasonable observer would conclude that the proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus.”

Writing the dissent for the court's four liberal members in the union case, Justice Elena Kagan said the majority succeeded in its ""crusade"" by ""turning the First Amendment into a sword.""

But conservatives cheered.

After the travel ban decision, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's campaign arm tweeted a photo of him and Gorsuch -- a reminder that it was McConnell who stalled on former President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, and later helped confirm Trump's nominee last year.

McConnell and his staff have touted the Gorsuch confirmation as a major GOP win.

Gorsuch had kept observers guessing. In April, he sided against the Trump administration in a case involving government efforts to deport foreigners convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., aligning with the court’s four more liberal justices.

"Obama-era diplomat Susan Rice on Thursday took a rather undiplomatic swing at British Prime Minister Theresa May’s clunky dance moves in Africa, saying her groove “takes the cake.”



“Somebody help her, please,” the former National Security Adviser and U.N. ambassador tweeted late Thursday.



May’s antics on a trip to Africa began in Cape Town this week where she met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and was greeted by a group of dancing students.



May was filmed woodenly dancing with some children, which quickly led to mockery by press and the Twitterati alike.

THERESA MAY BUSTS OUT DANCE MOVES DURING VISIT TO SOUTH AFRICA



But the normally reserved May, who is regularly teased for her stiffness, is apparently turning down for nothing, and got into her groove again in Nairobi -- where she was filmed dancing with Kenyan scouts.



It was this video which caught Rice’s eye and ire. Rice said she had seen leaders “get moved by the spirit, but this takes the cake.”



Rice may have been referring to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was filmed busting some awkward moves in South Africa in 2012.

Former President George W. Bush also raised eyebrows when he busted a move at the White House in 2007 with the KanKouran West African Dance Company.

May's trip comes at a turbulent time in her political career, and she is facing the prospect of a leadership challenge from former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson amid anger from the right of her Conservative Party over her handling over Brexit.

Therefore, May will be somewhat relieved that it seems to be rhythm, rather than Johnson, that is gonna get her.

"Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., who secured Florida’s GOP gubernatorial nomination on Tuesday, wasted little time before depicting his new Democratic rival as a candidate who wants to make “Florida Venezuela.”

DeSantis, who was backed by President Trump, appeared on the “Ingraham Angle” following his win, and denounced his competitor, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, as “the most liberal candidate that the Democratic Party has ever nominated in the state of Florida by a country mile in a governor’s race.”

Gillum’s unexpected win was seen as a huge win for the newly emerging progressive wing of the Democratic Party, and Tuesday's outcome immediately transformed the nation’s largest swing state into one of the key gubernatorial campaigns in the country.

I’m trying to make Florida even better, he wants to make Florida Venezuela. - U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla.

The mayor received an endorsement from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and was congratulated by newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The Miami Herald reported that he also benefited from “a financial boost from billionaires Tom Steyer and George Soros.”

DeSantis will test Trump’s grip on a crucial state he won in 2016.

The two will compete to replace outgoing Florida Gov. Rick Scott.

“(Gillum) wants to abolish ICE; he wants a billion-dollar tax increase; he wants a single-payer health care system in Florida, which would bankrupt the state. I’m trying to make Florida even better. He wants to make Florida Venezuela,” DeSantis said, adding that Gillum’s tenure as mayor has been “absolutely disastrous.”

The Herald reported that DeSantis is a member of the Freedom Caucus, which wants a border wall.

During the campaign, Gillum often said he was the only candidate that wasn’t a millionaire or billionaire, and spent the least of his Democratic rivals.

After winning the Democratic nomination, Gillum thanked supporters who embraced “our plan for a state that makes room for all of us, not just the well-heeled and the well-connected, but all of us.”

DeSantis, a former Navy lawyer and Harvard-educated Iraq War veteran, entered the race in January and has since made frequent appearances on Fox News. DeSantis won Tuesday’s GOP gubernatorial primary by beating state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.

Blaise Ingoglia, the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, told The Herald that he welcomes the challenge, saying, “progressive-slash-socialist candidates just don’t perform well in general elections.”

"Former White House staff member, Omarosa Maginault Newman, is out with a new book. She revealed, with no personal shame, that she had taped conversations while she worked in the White House, including with the president in the Oval Office and the chief of staff in the Situation Room. That is galling, despicable behavior. And even if Omarosa didn’t think that the president of the United States - the one who had given her the opportunity to try to achieve great things - doesn’t deserve better from her, I believe the citizens of this country do.

Flashback. In 2005, I was commissioned as a Special Assistant to the President as a deputy press secretary. In my first meeting with the chief of staff, Andy Card, he told me to remember that I wasn’t just serving the president or the Republican party, but the people of the United States of America. He told me the best way not to get a big head in the White House was to share it with others - to invite friends and family to experience it with me. And he also said to give thanks every day for working in the White House. That day I started saying a prayer of gratitude every time I walked into the West Wing, where the Marines guard the doors and open them to people privileged enough to be invited to work there.

Fast forward. In 2008, a former White House employee wrote a book critical and negative about President Bush. I was hurt, upset and angry. President Bush called me into the Oval. He said, I hear you’re upset about this book. I said yes sir, I am - because the coverage is terrible and I’m so sorry this happened. And he didn’t ask me to fight. He asked me to forgive. He told me no one would remember the book in about three weeks. He was right. On my way back to my office, he called after me and said, “Hey, I don’t think you’d ever do this to me.”

And with that, I was able to move beyond that book. I forgave and moved on with my work. That, President Bush said, is what working in the White House is about. It isn’t about the self but it is the people of this nation. They deserve the best work ethic White House employees can muster.

Omarosa chose not to do that. Her book will be forgotten. Her breach of confidence and ghastly disloyalty - to the country - will not be.",politics
"Republican Sen. Ben Sasse tore into his own branch of government Tuesday as he slammed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearing process as an “overblown, politicized circus.”

At the Judiciary Committee hearing, the Nebraska senator blamed a dysfunctional Congress for the overheated drama surrounding high court nominations. As the opening day devolved into a spectacle of protests and objections, Sasse explained there's so much ""hysteria"" and pressure with regard to the court because ""Congress has decided to self-neuter.""

He lamented that the Supreme Court justices, in turn, are expected to be ""super legislators."" This ""misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court,” he argued, accounts for the vitriolic rhetoric aimed at Kavanaugh.

At least two dozen people were arrested on the first day of the confirmation hearing, as they disrupted the proceedings with protests of Kavanaugh. Senate Democrats, too, continuously interrupted the opening statements of the hearing with calls to delay the proceedings.

However, Sasse said the rhetoric isn’t new to just Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing. Instead, he said the hearings “haven’t worked for 31 years in America” and said “screaming protesters saying ‘women are going to die’” have been present at these hearings for decades. He criticized the legislature for “giving away its power” to make the Supreme Court a “substitute political battleground.”

“The hysteria around Supreme Court nomination confirmation hearings is coming from the fact that we have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court in American life now,” Sasse said. “Our political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like they are people wearing red and blue jerseys; that’s a really dangerous thing.”

KAVANAUGH DOCUMENTS TAKE CENTER STAGE IN CONFIRMATION HEARING: WHAT DO DEMS WANT?

“It’s predictable that every confirmation hearing now is going to be [an] overblown, politicized circus. It’s because we’ve accepted a new theory about how our three branches of government should work, and in particular, how the judiciary should work,” Sasse continued.

Sasse said the Supreme Court has become a “substitute political battleground” because “Congress has decided to self-neuter” and continues to pass more authority to the executive branch.

“Most people here want their jobs more than they really want to do legislative work and so they punt most of the work to the next branch,” Sasse charged.

“We badly need to restore the proper duties and the balance of power from our constitutional system,” he continued.

KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HEARING LIKELY TO FOCUS ON ABORTION, GUN RIGHTS AND MORE

The lawmaker doubled down on his remarks during an interview Tuesday night on Fox News' ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" saying that ""Congress seems to have forgotten the three branches"" of government, which each need to carry out their intended duties.

""We need a Congress that passes laws and suffers the consequences that people get to hire and fire the Congress,"" Sasse said. ""We need an executive branch that tries to execute the laws that’ve been passed and we need judges who judge and not try to be super legislators. And most people in the Congress seem to have forgotten.""

He went on to say that he believes ""the left started this fight,"" however he blamed both sides of the political aisle.

""I do think that the left started this fight but I think both of these parties are really, really lame in teaching basic civics to our kids right now. People on both sides of the aisle regularly talk about the Supreme Court like there are Republican justices and Democratic justices,"" Sasse said.

Democrats have been under intense pressure from liberal voters to resist Trump, and many remain irate, even two years later, over the treatment of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court. Garland was denied so much as a hearing by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Kavanaugh worked for Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired at the end of July. Questioning of Kavanaugh will begin Wednesday, and votes on the Senate floor could occur this month. Kavanaugh could be on the bench when the court begins its new term on Oct. 1.

"President Trump called Wednesday for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation “right now,” alleging bias on the investigative team and complaining about the trial of his former campaign chairman.

“This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further,” Trump tweeted. “Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!”

The tweet renewed Democratic complaints that Trump is wrongly challenging the independence of the special counsel. Trump has repeatedly blasted the probe as a “witch hunt,” but the call for Sessions to intervene represents another escalation.

Sessions, however, already recused himself last year – handing off oversight to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. So he is unlikely to act.

A Justice Department spokesperson had no comment on the tweet when reached by Fox News. Another source familiar with the investigation downplayed the implications of the tweet – as Trump previously has vented his frustration with both the Russia probe and Sessions’ recusal from it.

Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in a statement: “We have been saying for months that it is time to bring this inquiry to an end. The President has expressed the same opinion.”

Trump afterward tweeted concerns about the trial of ex-campaign boss Paul Manafort, which entered its second day on Wednesday morning.

“Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn’t government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax!” he tweeted.

Trump went on to target the anti-Trump dossier and former investigators who exchanged anti-Trump text messages.

The president has previously tried to assert that Mueller is conflicted, based on a claim that he turned him down for FBI director, his ties to fired bureau boss James Comey and other issues. Trump has long complained about the presence of Democratic donors on the Mueller team.

But Democratic lawmakers have warned Trump and his allies about encroaching on the Mueller probe’s independence.

In response to Wednesday's tweet, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., top intelligence committee Democrat, said, ""This is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight. America must never accept it.""

After conservative House members unveiled a Rosenstein impeachment resolution, top House Democrats last week also noted that Mueller has already obtained over two-dozen indictments and said: “Any attempt to [take action against Mueller or Rosenstein] will be viewed by Congress and the American people as further proof of an effort to obstruct justice with severe consequences for Trump and his presidency.”

As Trump issued his call, Manafort’s trial, for tax and bank fraud charges unrelated to Russian meddling, was moving into full swing.

His defense team’s opening day strategy was to try and undermine the Mueller team’s star witness, Rick Gates, who was Manafort’s deputy in business and at the Trump campaign. The attorneys argued Gates was the one who transferred all the money into accounts, including consulting fees collected from Ukrainian political figures. They said he was embezzling money and later lied about it to investigators – before agreeing to flip and testify against Manafort.

But the Mueller team contends Manafort bankrolled a luxurious globe-trotting lifestyle with money he wasn’t paying taxes on.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye told the jury Tuesday that Manafort considered himself above the law as he funneled tens of millions of dollars through offshore accounts to pay for personal expenses such as a $21,000 watch and a $15,000 jacket made of ostrich.

""All of these charges boil down to one simple issue: that Paul Manafort lied,"" Asonye said. ""Manafort placed himself and his money over the law.""

Later Wednesday, Trump tweeted again, putting Manafort up against mob boss Al Capone, known by the nickname ""Scarface,"" who was charged with tax evasion.

""Looking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and “Public Enemy Number One,” or Paul Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?"" Trump tweeted.

"Dozens of people were arrested during the first day of Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court hearing as they interrupted the proceedings with shouts of protest against the judge.

United States Capitol Police said 70 people were arrested Tuesday during the contentious Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Police said 61 people were removed from the committee room and charged with disorderly conduct; an additional nine people were arrested in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and charged with crowding, obstructing, or incommoding, police said.

Among those arrested was UltraViolet executive director Shaunna Thomas, the women's organization told Fox News. Thomas, who co-founded the group focused on reproductive rights and combating sexism, said, “Senators, on behalf of the millions of women across the country whose rights will be stripped by a Kavanaugh court, I demand you reject this nomination,” according to an UltraViolet spokesperson.

Actress Piper Perabo also said she was arrested while protesting Kavanaugh Tuesday.

“I was just arrested for civil disobedience in the Kavanaugh hearings,” Perabo, known for “Covert Affairs” and “Coyote Ugly” said on social media. “Many citizens before me have fought for the equal rights of women. I can’t be silent when someone is nominated to the Supreme Court who would take our equal rights away.”

Interjections – from those in the audience and Democratic senators – peppered the hearing from its very start, even before Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, could make it through his opening statements. One by one, protesters stood and disrupted the hearing before being removed by police.

KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HEARING LIKELY TO FOCUS ON ABORTION, GUN RIGHTS AND MORE

“This is a mockery and a travesty of justice,” one woman shouted. “Cancel Brett Kavanaugh.”

Democrats also vociferously called for a delay in the hearing, citing some 42,000 documents regarding Kavanaugh’s work with past administrations that was made available to the committee last minute.

Kavanaugh’s opinions on presidential authority were called into question by Senate Democrats before the hearing began. Kavanaugh worked with Kenneth Starr in the 1990s, co-writing the independent counsel’s report laying out the legal framework supporting then-President Bill Clinton’s impeachment. He said Clinton should be impeached because he misled the public and lied to his staff.

But in 2009, citing his role with the investigation into Clinton, Kavanaugh expressed his opinion that presidents should not have to deal with criminal investigations or civil lawsuits while in office.

KAVANAUGH'S STAUNCH GUN-RIGHTS DEFENSE AMONG HUNDREDS OF DECISIONS IN SPOTLIGHT

Writing for the Minnesota Law Review, Kavanaugh said, “I think we grossly underestimate how difficult the job [of U.S. president] is.” Because of that, he said he believed “[it's] vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible.”

Questioning of Kavanaugh is to begin Wednesday, and votes in the committee and on the Senate floor could occur later in September.

Republicans command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, which would return to 51-49 once a Republican successor to the late Sen. John McCain is appointed. Republicans have little margin for error, though Vice President Pence can break a tie.

If all goes to Republicans’ plans, Kavanaugh could be sitting on the bench when the Supreme Court begins its new term on Oct. 1.

"A former Trump administration official was accused by liberal activists on Tuesday of being a white supremacist over an unintentional hand gesture she made during the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

Zina Gelman Bash, a former Kavanaugh clerk who now works in Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s administration, was attacked by liberal activist on social media for holding her hand in an “OK” gesture as she was sitting behind Kavanaugh. Many on social media believed it was a so-called “white power” hate symbol.

“What fresh hell is this!!!??? Kavanaugh’s assistant Zina Bash giving the white power sign right behind him during the hearing? This alone should be disqualify!!!” Amy Siskind, president and co-founder of the female advocacy group New Agenda, wrote in a now-deleted tweet.

She later backtracked, saying that her comment became “a distraction,” though urged the media to ask Bash about the gesture, noting that “it's not a natural resting position.”

The conspiracy didn’t slow down even after some pointed out that Bash had a Mexican mother and a Jewish father, while her grandparents only narrowly escaped the Holocaust.

“This neo-nazi is Zina Bash. She’s intentionally throwin up White Power signs at a Supreme Court Justice confirmation hearing. On national TV. She works for Kavanaugh & is also one of the writers for Trump’s immigration policy. This is their new Amerikkka,” tweeted actress Kelly Mantle.

The Anti-Defamation League previously noted that the “OK” gesture isn’t a hate symbol. “Has the simple thumb-and-forefinger ‘OK’ hand gesture become a white supremacist hand sign? Well, no, it hasn’t, but you are likely to hear just the opposite from social media, thanks to the latest hoax from members of notorious website 4chan,” read a post from the anti-racism group.

“Kavanaugh’s former law clerk Zina Bash is flashing a white power sign behind him during his Senate confirmation hearing. They literally want to bring white supremacy to the Supreme Court. What a national outrage and a disgrace to the rule of law,” wrote Dr. Eugene Gu, attracting over 12 thousand retweets.

U.S. Attorney John Bash, her husband, came to the defense his wife on social media, posting a series of comments regarding the false accusations leveled against Bash.

“The attacks today on my wife are repulsive. Everyone tweeting this vicious conspiracy theory should be ashamed of themselves. We weren’t even familiar with the hateful symbol being attributed to her for the random way she rested her hand during a long hearing,” he wrote.

“Zina is Mexican on her mother’s side and Jewish on her father’s side. She was born in Mexico. Her grandparents were Holocaust survivors. We of course have nothing to do with hate groups, which aim to terrorize and demean other people — never have and never would,” he continued.

“Some of the Twitter comments have even referred to our baby daughter. I know that there are good folks on both sides of the political divide. I hope that people will clearly condemn this idiotic and sickening accusation,” he posted.",politics
"Fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe wrote a secret memo on circumstances leading up to the firing of his former boss James Comey.

A person familiar with the situation told the Associated Press on Wednesday that the previously unknown document was turned over to special counsel Robert Mueller.

Mueller and his team are investigating whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 presidential election and if the president’s decision to fire Comey last May was an attempt to obstruct the investigation.

The memo reportedly recalls a conversation McCabe had with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about his preparation for Comey’s firing.

Rosenstein, who’s currently facing calls to resign from members of the U.S. Congress amid his reluctance to comply with U.S. House oversight, played a role in the downfall of Comey as he penned a memo that criticized Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation that the White House used to justify the firing.

ROSENSTEIN FIGHTS HOUSE GOP IMPEACHEMENT PUSH, SAYS DOJ ‘IS NOT GOING TO BE EXTORTED’

The memo by McCabe reportedly claims Rosenstein suggested to him that he was initially asked to reference the Russia investigation in the memo about Comey. The final memo by the deputy attorney general didn’t mention Russia and instead focused on the Clinton email case.

Rosenstein appointed Mueller just a week after Comey was fired from his role. The job fell to Rosenstein because Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the case because of his advisory role in Trump's campaign.

McCabe is known to have kept personal notes on his interactions with Trump, some of which included what Comey told him about his encounters with the president, Fox News reported. He turned over the memos to Mueller.

Trump criticized the documents, saying in March that he never saw McCabe take notes about their conversations, suggesting the memos should be called “fake memos.”

“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?” Trump tweeted.

McCabe was fired in March, just days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension, amid a report by an inspector general, claiming he misled internal investigators reviewing the bureau’s probe of Clinton’s email server and leaked a self-serving story to the media.

Sessions, who authorized the McCabe firing, said at the time that McCabe “made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions.”

DOJ IG RELEASES EXPLOSIVE REPORT THAT LED TO FIRING OF EX-FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR ANDREW MCCABE

Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who also penned the damning report, determined that McCabe authorized the leak yet later told the investigators that he did authorize the disclosure and did not know who was responsible.

“[W]e concluded that McCabe’s decision to confirm the existence of the CF investigation through an anonymously sourced quote, recounting the content of a phone call with a senior department official in a manner designed to advance his personal interests at the expense of department leadership, was clearly not within the public interest exception,"" the report said.

"President Trump said Friday that a high-stakes summit between him and Kim Jong Un is back on for June 12, following a lengthy meeting with a top North Korean official in the Oval Office.

“We'll be meeting on June 12 in Singapore,"" the president told reporters after the North Korean emissary left the White House.

He called Friday's meeting with North Korea's Kim Yong Chol a ""great start."" Trump confirmed that the visiting official gave him a personal letter from dictator Kim Jong Un, though he hadn't yet read it.

""We're going to deal,"" Trump said.

Trump spoke to reporters after an extraordinary scene played out on White House grounds, with Trump hosting the North Korean official for over an hour in the Oval Office -- the latest gesture in an effort by both sides to get talks back on track after North Korea's belligerent rhetoric prompted Trump to nix the summit last week.

Trump said the meeting was supposed to just be about ""the delivery of a letter"" but ended up being a lengthy conversation with the ""second most powerful man in North Korea.""

“We talked about a lot of things,"" Trump said. ""We really did. But the big deal will be on June 12.”

After the meeting, Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo were seen taking photos with the visitors.

Kim Yong Chol is the most senior North Korean visitor to the United States since Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok visited Washington in 2000 to meet President Bill Clinton. He is North Korea's former military intelligence chief and is one of the North Korean leader's closest aides.

Trump said they also discussed ending the Korean War between North and South Korea.

“Can you believe that we're talking about the ending of the Korean War?” Trump told reporters. “We're talking about 70 years.”

TRUMP-KIM SUMMIT, FROM THE INVITATION TO THE CANCELLATION: A TIMELINE

The official's arrival in Washington came a day after Pompeo declared that he was confident negotiations with Pyongyang over holding a nuclear summit were ""moving in the right direction.""

""Our two countries face a pivotal moment in our relationship, and it would be nothing short of tragic to let this opportunity go to waste,"" Pompeo said in New York after meeting with Kim.

The two countries, eyeing the first summit between the U.S. and the North after six decades of hostility, have also been holding negotiations in Singapore and the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.

Kim Yong Chol left his hotel in New York City early Friday for the trip to Washington in a convoy of SUVs. Pompeo, the former CIA chief who has traveled to North Korea and met with Kim Jong Un twice in the past two months, said he believed the country's leaders are ""contemplating a path forward where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before.""

"A judge this week approved a settlement between the IRS and hundreds of tea party groups, in which the federal agency agreed to pay out $3.5 million, reports said.

The conservative groups were the subjects of illegal and unwarranted scrutiny by the federal agency for political purposes, the Chattanooga Times Free Press reported.

""It shows that when a government agency desires to target citizens based on their viewpoints, a price will be paid,"" said Edward Greim, a lawyer who led the class-action case in federal court in Cincinnati, according to the Washington Times.

The tea party groups received a ""sincere apology"" from the IRS, and the government agreed to a declaratory judgment that ""it is wrong"" to srutinize a tax return because of a taxpayer's name or political philosophy, the report said.

""I'm not frankly aware of any other class-action lawsuit against the IRS for anything where the IRS paid money,"" Mark Meckler, who as president of Citizens for Self Governance funded the class-action challenge, previously told the Times when the settlement was submitted for final approval a few weeks ago.

Lois Lerner, then-senior executive of the IRS, allegedly ""put in place new processes that guaranteed even more delay,"" Greim told the Times, referring to tea party groups' attempts to secure tax-exempt status.

But Lerner denied that she encouraged the targeting. In fact, a U.S. Justice Department review cleared her and called her one of the ""heroes of the saga,"" saying she attempted to stop it, according to the newspaper.

The litigation for Wednesday's settlement lasted about five years, the Times reported.

The decision over whether Lerner's deposition explaining her behavior would be shielded from public view is still being argued in court, the report said.

"Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Friday said he plans to present an amendment preventing President Trump from “arbitrarily revoking security clearances.”

Warner’s announcement came after Trump earlier this week revoked the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan and hinted Friday that he would soon do the same for Department of Justice official Bruce Ohr.

“I will be introducing an amendment next week to block the President from punishing and intimidating his critics by arbitrarily revoking security clearances,” Warner tweeted. “Stay tuned.”

TRUMP REVOKES EX-CIA DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN’S SECURITY CLEARANCE

The amendment would be made to the defense appropriations bill, which is combined with a bill to fund the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, and is currently on the Senate floor, Fox News has learned.

On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, in a statement on behalf of Trump, made the announcement about Brennan, saying that he “has a history that calls his credibility into question.”

The statement also claimed that Brennan had been “leveraging” his clearance to make “wild outbursts” and claims against the Trump administration in the media.

“The president has a constitutional responsibility to protect classified information and who has access to it, and that’s what he’s doing is fulfilling that responsibility in this action,” Sanders said.

TRUMP CALLS DOJ OFFICIAL BRUCE OHR A ‘DISGRACE,’ HINTS AT REVOKING SECURITY CLEARANCE

Brennan, who served in the Obama administration, has often been critical of Trump’s conduct.

In response to the revocation announcement, Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called it an effort to “scare away critics.”

“This is clearly another effort to silence critics and not allow the Mueller investigation and for that matter the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation to get to the bottom of this,” he continued.

"Both supporters and opponents of President Trump should welcome the firing of disgraced FBI Agent Peter Strzok, announced Monday. He and fired FBI Director James Comey and fired Deputy Director Andrew McCabe have done more damage to America’s premier law enforcement agency than anyone in its storied 110-year history.

Because President Trump has frequently tweeted denunciations of this trio, it’s understandable that many people view their firings as unjustified political vendettas by the president against his critics.

But while their clearly is no love lost between the president, Strzok, Comey and McCabe, there is no doubt that by any objective standard, all three deserved to be fired for misconduct. I say this as someone who spent 24 years proudly serving as an FBI special agent and who retired as an assistant director in charge of all FBI criminal investigations.

All three of these rogue FBI officials put themselves on pedestals and cast themselves as noble heroes willing to sacrifice their own careers for the cause of truth and justice. That’s great PR spin, and much of the media has fallen for it. But it’s simply not true.

FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich was fully justified in ordering Strzok’s firing. The action was a decisive step in the right direction in correcting the wrongs committed by what has been described as Comey's ""skinny inner circle.""

Strzok left no doubt in many text message exchanges with FBI lawyer Lisa Page – his partner in an extramarital affair – that he was strongly opposed to Donald Trump’s election as president, had only contempt for Trump, and desperately wanted Democrat Hillary Clinton to defeat Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

But the reasons for Strzok’s firing, other than the texts, are still not public. It is clear to me that his effectiveness as an FBI agent was thoroughly compromised and his conduct was in direct contradiction to the FBI's core values.

In other words, Strzok was not fired for simply expressing his opinion privately. According to the Department of Justice inspector general, Strzok also used his private email to send and receive classified information – exactly the misconduct by Hillary Clinton he was supposed to be investigating.

The actions by Strzok, Comey and McCabe disgusted me and many of the dedicated, loyal, patriotic and courageous men and women who have served in the FBI – often willingly risking their lives in defense of our country.

I consistently hear from many current and former FBI employees who bitterly resent how Strzok, Comey and McCabe broke rules that all FBI employees are required to follow – from the lowest level up to the director.

The disgraced trio leaked to reporters for self-serving reasons. They put their thumbs on the scale of justice repeatedly to protect Hillary Clinton when investigating her improper handling of classified emails and the shady activities of the Clinton Foundation.

At the same time, the trio aggressively pursued every spurious lead and rumor that mentioned Donald Trump, who they clearly did not want to see become president.

On joining the FBI, every employee is told that politics have no place at this great law enforcement agency.

Instead, the work of the men and women of the FBI should be governed by steadfast professionalism and respect for the procedures and safeguards established by our Founding Fathers.

FBI employees are required to treat every investigation equally without making judgments and regardless of the identity and position of each person being investigated. Moral judgments are the bailiwick of judges and juries – not FBI agents.

This is not to say that the investigation concerning Russian espionage targeting our democratic institutions should be dropped. President Vladimir Putin’s Russia and his enablers are our adversaries.

Every American should want to know the full scope and extent of Russian actions designed to destabilize our democracy by interfering in our 2016 election, so that such interference never happens again.

However, all investigations should be treated with the same integrity, thoroughness and objectivity that the FBI has been known for. Politics aside, it is now clear to any rational observer that the actions of “the skinny inner circle” were motivated by ego and animus and strayed far from the values that should anchor every FBI action.

FBI Deputy Director Bowdich, who ordered Strzok’s firing, is a consummate professional and undoubtedly took no joy in firing Strozk, who is an Army veteran and served in the FBI for over 20 years.

It is refreshing that Bowdich showed considerable courage and integrity in overruling his own highly bureaucratic Office of Professional Responsibility, which recommended a mere 60-day suspension and demotion for Strzok. That punishment was simply inadequate for Strzok’s level of wrongdoing.

Bowdich’s courageous action represents the best of the FBI because he made this decision despite the fact that radical anti-Trumpers have rushed to support Strozk financially in, among other things, a lawsuit against the FBI and Bowdich personally.

After Deputy Director McCabe was fired, anti-Trump elements rushed to set up a fund for him to draw upon.

A “Friends of Special Agent Peter Strzok” GoFundMe page had already amassed over $315,000 by Tuesday afternoon in just in a single day, and donations were pouring in.

All it takes for FBI executives to earn such golden parachutes is to violate their oaths of office and throw the agency into the vortex of politics and partisanship.

We certainly have not heard the last of this firing because Strzok, as a military veteran, has certain appeal rights. And, of course, he has the gratitude and support of the anti-Trump media.

The newly fired FBI agent, Comey and McCabe were clearly motivated by self-serving hubris and blind hatred of Donald Trump rather than rules and principals that are built into our criminal justice system to protect all Americans from the formidable powers invested in our federal investigative agencies.

Strzok, Comey and McCabe should stand in shame and dishonor for their failure to live up to the core FBI values of fidelity, bravery and integrity. America is better off with the firings of these three from an outstanding law enforcement agency.",politics
"To serve in the Trump administration is to deserve hazard pay, and lately that’s especially true of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.

The green-industrial complex claimed Scott Pruitt’s scalp last month, ginning up a storm of ethics allegations that forced his resignation as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Now it has shifted focus to Zinke. But it’s hitting walls. Zinke isn’t giving his detractors easy opportunities. He has aides who know and follow the rules, and backing in the White House and in Congress.

Not that the incoming is pleasant. Few movements are better funded and coordinated or more messianic than the environmental left. They despise a Trump team that is correcting decades of backward energy and environmental schemes and are working furiously to bring down the reformers. Unlike green groups of 20 years ago, which focused on policy, today’s effort is focused almost entirely on personal destruction.

Zinke’s antagonists include the usual big-dollar organizations, like the Natural Resources Defense Council, many of which are now staffed or run by former Obama officials; self-described watchdog groups like the Western Values Project, that are closely tied to major environmental and labor groups; and congressional allies such as Democratic Rep.

"The United States will respond reciprocally to Venezuela’s decision to expel two top American diplomats, the U.S. Secretary of State said Wednesday.

Mike Pompeo said the State Department received formal notice that charge d’affaires Todd Robinson had been declared persona non grata and had 49 hours to leave the country. He told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the U.S. would act in kind, suggesting it would remove Venezuela’s top diplomat in Washington as well.

“We will respond appropriately, certainly reciprocally, but perhaps more than that, perhaps proportionately,” he said. “We’re watching the Maduro regime continue to engage in destructive behavior for the Venezuelan people.”

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced Tuesday he was expelling Robinson and his deputy Brian Naranjo for allegedly conspiring against his government by pressuring opposition groups to boycott Sunday’s presidential election that he won by a landslide.

The two career diplomats have 48 hours to leave the country.

The Trump administration denounced the recent presidential election as fraudulent, and the president signed an executive order restricting the Venezuelan government’s ability liquidate assets for pennies on the dollar at the expense of the Venezuelan people – in so-called “fire sales.”

“This order is the most recent in a strong, consistent stream of actions my Administration has taken targeting the Maduro regime,” Trump said in a statement. “We call for the Maduro regime to restore democracy, hold free and fair elections, release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally, and end the repression and economic deprivation of the Venezuelan people.”

"As trade tensions between the U.S. and China continue to escalate, Chinese officials announced Friday the country tested its first hypersonic flight vehicle capable of carrying nuclear weapons -- and allegedly able to penetrate any missile defense system.

The China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics, run by state-owned space contractor China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, said it conducted a successful first flight test of the Xingkong-2, otherwise known as Starry Sky-2, state-tabloid Global Times reported.

The flight vehicle was launched at a target range in Northwest China with a multi-stage rocket before being released in the air, making ""large-angle turning maneuvers,"" and achieving a top speed of Mach 6, or 4,563 mph, the academy said.

The aircraft then landed in a designated landing zone, where it provided researchers with ""effective"" test data.

“The test…has laid a solid technological foundation for engineering applications of the waverider design,” officials said in a statement to the South China Morning Post.

The Starry Sky 2, a waverider, is a hypersonic flight vehicle that uses shockwaves generated by its own flight in the air to glide at a high speed, and features a wedge-shaped fuselage.

""The test showed that China is advancing shoulder-to-shoulder with the US and Russia,"" Song told the news outlet.

Song added that since the waverider flies so fast, it challenges current anti-missile defense systems designed to protect against slower cruise and ballistic missiles.

The test on Friday was the first time China publicly disclosed the development of the waverider. The U.S. and Russia have been researching and testing waveriders since 2010.

"Eight years ago, it seemed there wasn’t a bright future awaiting young Americans. They were deceived by politicians who promised them the American Dream but delivered an economic nightmare.

They were faced with the highest youth unemployment rate on record. The youth unemployment rate measures joblessness for people ages 16 to 24 who are actively seeking work.

In June 2010, 19.1 percent of young Americans seeking work were unemployed. But by last month the youth jobless figure was less than half that – 9.2 percent.

President Trump’s policies have reversed this horrific trend, rescuing our next great generation from years of despair fostered by Democrats in Washington.

Echoing partisan talking points, President Trump’s critics may be quick to question whether the administration has improved the lives of underprivileged youth. Yet, black and Hispanic youth unemployment rates have also declined, dropping to new historic lows.

The extraordinary improvement in youth employment would not be possible without President Trump’s focus on strengthening small businesses across the country. By decreasing taxes and slashing regulations, the President has unleashed our economy, creating millions of new jobs for Americans of all ages.

Less than two years after the 2016 presidential election, the U.S. economy began growing at a rate that many thought was impossible, and the overall unemployment rate has dropped to the lowest point of the century.

To promote youth employment through policy solutions, President Trump has placed a very high priority on workforce training, providing young people and other workers with new skills to prepare for new jobs in our evolving economy. Last year, he took action to get “companies, unions, industry groups and federal agencies to go out and create new opportunities for millions of citizens.”

When President Trump took office, he inherited an unprecedented crisis in higher education. This too has held young people back from advancing in their lives productively. During the previous administration, the number of graduating college seniors with debt was skyrocketing.

President Obama’s Department of Education pledged to solve the student debt crisis, but it was utterly inept in its effort to address the issue. An Education Department memorandum admitted that officials “overstated student loan repayment rates at most colleges and trade schools.”

An independent study by The Wall Street Journal later confirmed that the Education Department inflated 99.8 percent of all repayments across America. This appears to be an effort to cook the books and conceal the true crisis for young people completing their college degrees.

President Trump, on the other hand, is tackling the issue of student debt head-on, proposing to overhaul the loan servicing system and undo other failed policies implemented by the previous administration.

While everyone can agree that young Americans have suffered economically in recent years, Democrats in Washington are refusing to compromise with President Trump on reasonable measures to improve the economic condition of our youth.

A healthy economy is a foundation for a healthy future. Thanks to President Trump, the renewed confidence of businesses across America is now resulting in more jobs for young people than ever before. The economy is also growing at a record pace, ensuring that new opportunities will continue to emerge for America’s youth.

America’s young people deserve more than a mediocre future – and we now have demonstrated proof that President Trump is building a path for our success.",politics
"The Trump administration announced new plans Tuesday to roll back and replace Obama-era regulations on emissions from coal-fired power plants – a move praised by the coal industry as a job saver but panned by critics as a green-light to polluters.

The newly unveiled Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, as it’s called, would give states broad authority to determine how to restrict carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. It’s meant as a replacement to the Obama-era Clean Power Plan that sought to speed up the closure of coal-burning power plants and cut back on greenhouse gases by cutting carbon dioxide emissions and encouraging utilities to invest in cleaner energy sources like wind and solar.

“The ACE Rule would restore the rule of law and empower states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide modern, reliable, and affordable energy for all Americans,” Environmental Protection Agency Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. “Today’s proposal provides the states and regulated community the certainty they need to continue environmental progress while fulfilling President Trump’s goal of energy dominance.”

The effort is part of Trump’s overall bid to roll back regulations and help the struggling coal sector in particular. He is likely to highlight the plan at a rally in Charleston, W.Va., Tuesday evening.

While the Obama administration and Democrats saw the Clean Power Plan as a crucial component in international efforts to curb global warming, Republicans have long claimed those regulations went too far and were too costly. From the start of President Trump’s administration, his Environmental Protection Agency has been working to overhaul the program.

“An important part of what we are doing here is getting us back in our lane -- we believe the CPP went beyond the EPA's legal authority in many ways,” EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation Bill Wehrum said during a press call on Tuesday. “We think we are on very firm legal ground -- much more so than the CPP was.”

Without making a specific reference to the EPA proposal, Trump tweeted Tuesday that he’s “done so much for West Virginia” as he teased the rally, adding: “CLEAN COAL!!!!”

The new plan would let states set performance standards for existing coal-fired power plants, providing them with a list of “candidate technologies” that can be used to draft their plans. The proposal would let states relax pollution rules for power plants that need upgrades, according to a summary reviewed by The Associated Press.

Tuesday’s announcement was slammed by top Democrats and numerous environmental activists as a “desperate attempt” to save the flagging coal industry.

""The proposed rollback of life-saving clean air and climate safeguards is unacceptable and exposes Wheeler’s EPA as a puppet of the very coal executives who used to sign his paychecks and want to pollute with impunity,"" Patrick Grenter, a Pennsylvania official with the Sierra Club, said in a statement. “This is another desperate attempt by the Trump Administration to prop up the dirty and obsolete coal industry, but it won’t work.”

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called ACE “a brazen special interest handout” in a statement.

The EPA projects that the overhaul of the Clean Power Plan could cut regulatory compliance costs by up to $400 million per year, while also reducing CO2 emissions.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from the coal state of Kentucky, praised the Trump administration’s move, while taking aim at the Clean Power Plan.

“This so-called ‘Clean Power Plan’ they dreamed up would’ve had no meaningful effect on global emissions,” McConnell said in a statement. “It would, however, have packed up middle-class American jobs and sent them overseas.”

The EPA plans to hold a public hearing and accept public comment on the proposal for another two months.

Combined with a planned rollback of car-mileage standards, the plan represents a significant shift from Obama efforts to fight global warming and shift away from coal and toward less-polluting energy sources such as natural gas, wind and solar power. Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement.

Obama's plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.

The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation.

"Hungary's Central European University says it has been forced to suspend education programs for refugees and asylum seekers due to a new ""immigration surtax"" that took effect last week.

The Budapest-based university, founded by Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, said Tuesday that the decision came due to uncertainty over how it would be legally and financially affected by the 25 percent levy imposed by the government on activities that it says assist immigration.

Some 55 refugees or asylum seekers were to take part in the CEU programs, launched in 2016.

"Suspects awaiting trial in California will now have their bail eliminated, according to a bill signed by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown on Tuesday.

In lieu of bail, suspects will be gauged under a risk-assessment system, although the details of the program, which will take effect in October 2019, were not immediately clear.

Suspects looking at serious, violent felonies won’t be eligible for release prior to trial but the majority of suspects arrested for nonviolent misdemeanors will be let go within 12 hours of being booked, according to the legislation.

The bill gives officials 24 hours to determine whether other suspects should be released before trial. That time can be extended by 12 hours if necessary.

“Today, California reforms its bail system so that rich and poor alike are treated fairly,” Brown said in a statement, according to The Sacramento Bee.

Brown's signature gives the state's Judicial Council, the policy-making body for California's courts, broad authority to reshape pretrial detention policies.

Each county will use the council's framework as a basis to set its own procedures for deciding whom to release before trial, potentially creating a patchwork system based on where a suspect lives.

Senate Bill 10, the formal title of the legislation, was approved by the legislature earlier this month, according to The Sacramento Bee, but faced significant opposition from the bail industry prior to Brown's signing on Tuesday.

"White House Counsel Don McGahn plans to leave the Trump administration after the upcoming confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump said Wednesday.

“White House Counsel Don McGahn will be leaving his position in the fall, shortly after the confirmation (hopefully) of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court,” Trump tweeted. “I have worked with Don for a long time and truly appreciate his service!”

McGahn’s departure had been expected. Fox News reported earlier this summer that McGahn had expressed a desire to leave the White House, and he could be replaced by former George W. Bush aide Emmet Flood.

But the announcement caught at least one senior Republican by surprise. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley urged Trump to keep his White House counsel on board.

""I hope it’s not true McGahn is leaving WhiteHouse Counsel. U can’t let that happen,"" Grassley, R-Iowa, tweeted.

McGahn served as Trump’s top campaign lawyer during the presidential campaign in 2016.

The announcement of his departure comes amid revelations McGahn extensively cooperated with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team probing Russia’s attempted interference in the 2016 election.

Trump has said he approved of McGahn’s cooperation, and his legal team has used the revelation that investigators spent more than 30 hours with McGahn to argue it’s time to wrap up the probe.

As first reported by The New York Times, McGahn's discussions with Mueller's team covered moments surrounding Trump’s decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey, and his reported preference that Attorney General Jeff Sessions oversee the investigation. Sessions ultimately recused himself.

John Dowd, Trump’s former lead outside attorney, told Fox News earlier this month that “Don McGahn was a very strong witness for the president.”

Insurgents killed 19 security personnel in separate assaults in Afghanistan, officials said Thursday, a day after twin bombings in Kabul killed 21 people, including two local TV reporters.

Another 89 people were wounded in Wednesday's bombings, in a Shiite neighborhood of the capital. The attack bore the hallmarks of the Islamic State group, which has carried out a wave of bombings against minority Shiites in recent years. The Taliban denied responsibility.

Later Wednesday, suspected Taliban insurgents overran a security outpost in the northern Badghis province and then ambushed reinforcements, killing a total of 10 soldiers, according to Jamshid Shahabi, a spokesman for the governor.

In what is being described as an insider attack, a local police official in the northern Takhar province turned his weapon on his colleagues early Thursday, killing all eight. Abdul Khali Aseir, the provincial police spokesman, says the gunman escaped.

Two journalists from Afghanistan's TOLO TV were among those killed in the Kabul bombings. Samim Faramarz and Ramiz Ahmadi were ""fearless"" reporters who represented what is best in the country, the station said in a posting on Twitter.

""They challenged and pushed boundaries to deliver news to millions daily. . .We are devastated,"" it said.

The U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, condemned the ""callous attack"" in Kabul and expressed ""deep concern over the heavy price paid by Afghan media, with the killing of journalists in Afghanistan being among the highest in the world.""

In April, nine journalists who rushed to the scene of an explosion in Kabul were killed by a second suicide bomber. A 10th journalist was killed the same day, shot in eastern Khost province.

Both the Taliban and IS carry out near-daily attacks in Afghanistan targeting security forces and government officials, but IS also regularly targets Shiites, who it views as apostates.

In the same neighborhood where the twin bombings took place, an Islamic State suicide bomber killed 35 high school graduates last month as they sat for their university entrance exams. The dead were all teenagers.

"Revelations that an FBI informant was in contact with members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election have opened the door to a cascade of new details about those communications, emboldening Republican demands for a full accounting of how the Russia investigation began.

“If they had spies in my campaign ... for political purposes, that would be unprecedented,” President Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in Tuesday, calling it a “disgrace.”

“I hope there weren’t,” Trump added. “[If there were], it would make every political event ever before look like small potatoes.”

The latest detail emerged overnight when former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo revealed to Fox News there might be at least two informants -- saying he, too, was approached.

“Let me tell you something that I know for a fact,” Caputo said on “The Ingraham Angle.” “This informant, this person that they tried to plant into the campaign ... he’s not the only person who came to the campaign. And the FBI is not the only Obama agency who came at the campaign.”

Caputo added: “I know because they came at me. And I’m looking for clearance from my attorney to reveal this to the public. This is just the beginning.”

He claimed that when the truth comes out, ""Director Clapper and the rest of them will be wearing some orange suits,"" referring to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

Caputo did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment on Tuesday.

Fox News also has confirmed that the original reported informant was in communication with at least three campaign officials.

The informant spoke with Trump campaign adviser Sam Clovis, in addition to Carter Page and foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos.

A source told Fox News' John Roberts that Clovis met with the informant, whom he knew to be a professor, and had a conversation related to China. The source told Fox News that Russia did not come up.

The source told Fox News that Clovis received a follow-up email from the individual in the months before the election with research material on China, and another email on the day after the election congratulating the campaign.

Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

The new revelations have renewed Republican calls for a second special counsel.

On Tuesday, GOP Reps. Lee Zeldin, Ron DeSantis, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Matt Gaetz and other members of Congress are expected to announce a resolution detailing misconduct at the highest levels of the Justice Department and the FBI regarding Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuse, the end of the Hillary Clinton email probe, and the beginning of the Trump-Russia investigation. The 12-page resolution will also call for the appointment of another special counsel.

Among other claims, the resolution says the ""DOJ, FBI, or both appear to have planted at least one person into Donald Trump’s Presidential campaign."" The FBI was led at the time by James Comey.

“I don’t think the Justice Department is going to be able to investigate themselves,” DeSantis, R-Fla., said on “Fox & Friends” Tuesday. “I think they’ve resisted our inquiries here in Congress for long enough and so it’s time that we did have a special counsel.”

President Trump demanded an investigation on Sunday, following initial reports that an informant had contacts with members of his campaign. The Justice Department then directed that Inspector General Michael Horowitz investigate whether agents surveilled the campaign for political purposes, and whether any such demands came from the Obama administration.

TRUMP MEETS WITH ROSENSTEIN, WRAY AMID CAMPAIGN SPYING CLAIMS

Despite that probe, DeSantis said there is still a need for a special counsel, as an inspector general does not have subpoena power and cannot prosecute.

“The inspector general can [investigate] … I don’t think it’s mutually exclusive, but we in Congress need the information and you also need the special counsel,” DeSantis said.

On Monday, the president met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray to discuss the expansion of the inspector general’s investigation to include “irregularities” with the FBI or DOJ’s “tactics concerning the Trump campaign.”

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also said that during the meeting, the three agreed that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly would “immediately set up a meeting with the FBI, DOJ, and DNI together with congressional leaders to review highly classified and other information they have requested.”

DeSantis applauded the president for holding the meeting, and said, “I think John Kelly will be able to get these guys in line.”

A source told Fox News that meeting could take place as early as Tuesday afternoon, but the details are unclear.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has been floated as a possible 2020 Democratic presidential pick, was forced to backtrack this week after saying America “was never that great” -- the latest example of top Democrats criticizing what they see as the country’s injustices.

But now Republicans are saying that it represents part of a broader theme for top Democrats, saying that they are united in their ""collective bashing of America.""



Cuomo shocked supporters, and sparked a national controversy when he said at a bill signing: “We’re not going to make America great again, it was never that great.”



“We have not reached greatness, we will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged, we will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51 percent of our population, is gone,” he went on to add.



Cuomo was criticized for the remark on both sides of the political spectrum. On the left, gubernatorial challenger Cynthia Nixon told NY1 it was “another example of Andrew Cuomo trying to figure out what a progressive sounds like and missing by a mile.”

GOV. ANDREW CUOMO'S INCREDIBLE STATEMENT DISSING AMERICA SHOWS BANKRUPTCY OF DEMOCRATIC IDEAS

President Trump meanwhile, tore into his long-standing rival in a series of tweets in recent days. He called it “a career threatening statement” from Cuomo and predicted that “his political career is over.”



Cuomo has been walking back the statement. His office released a statement saying that he does, in fact, believe that America is great, but that it has yet to reach its full potential. Meanwhile on Friday in a call with reporters, he said the remark was “inartful.""



“Of course America is great and of course America has always been great. No one questions that,” he said.



But the remark is the latest in a series of bolder statements from Democrats in calling out what they see as injustices or inequalities in America.



It’s also something that Republicans are keen to exploit, believing that while such statements may play well with left-wing activists, it will be rejected by the nation at large.



In an email blast this week, The Republican National Committee said that “the only thing that seems to unify prominent Democrats these days is their collective bashing of America.”



Trump suggested Cuomo’s remark was an extension of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s famous statement that half of Trump supporters could be put into “a basket of deplorables.”

“Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic -- you name it,” she said.

That remark was widely perceived to have hurt her campaign, and many Trump supporters now wear the “deplorable” tag as a badge of honor.

Last week she was criticized for supporting an 11-year-old student who refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.

""Keep up the good work Mariana,"" she tweeted.

But the RNC pointed to other remarks from other possible 2020 candidates who appeared to take a swing at America, or large numbers of people in it.

Earlier this month Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., told an audience in New Orleans that things are “savagely wrong” in America and that there is a “normalcy of injustice.”

CORY BOOKER SAYS HE'S CRIED 'TEARS OF RAGE' OVER TRUMP RHETORIC, CLAIMS SOMETHING 'SAVAGELY WRONG' WITH US

“I’m a big believer that if America, if this country hasn’t broken your heart, then you don’t love her enough. Because there’s things that are savagely wrong in this country. There’s a normalcy of injustice that we’ve accepted,” he said.

Also this month, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who ran against Clinton in the Democratic primary, said that there was something “fundamentally immoral” about America due to its economic inequality.

“I think that there is an understanding there is something fundamentally immoral and wrong about a nation in which we have three people who own more wealth than the bottom half of the American people. That does not make sense,” Sanders said in an appearance on CBS.

Meanwhile Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., came under fire from police groups when she described America’s criminal justice system as racist “front to back.”

“The hard truth about our criminal justice system: It’s racist ... front to back.” she said before a college audience.

POLICE, SESSIONS SLAM WARREN FOR CALLING CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 'RACIST'

The GOP said that the remarks show that Democrats are out of touch, and it would appear to be an issue where there isn’t much support from the public. A 2016 Washington Post poll found that only seven percent of those polled said that America has never been great.

"Nearly two dozen people -- including a child -- were killed when a raised highway in Genoa crumbled during a sudden and violent storm, sending several vehicles plunging to the ground where rescuers desperately searched for survivors.

Italy's civil protection agency Angelo Borrelli said in a news conference that 20 people were killed and 13 others were injured when a 650-foot section of the Morandi bridge collapsed over an industrial zone just after 12 p.m. local time. The bridge is part of the A10 highway that connects Italy to France.

Italian transport official Edoardo Rixi initially said 22 people were killed and eight were injured. Local reports, however, indicated the death toll could rise a rescue efforts continue.

The victims appear to all have been in vehicles when the structure crumbled beneath them, causing them to plunge nearly 300 feet to the ground, according to Borrelli. The concrete pieces also crushed two warehouses below, but officials believe no one was inside because the buildings were closed for summer holiday.

About 20 vehicles were involved, firefighter Amalia Tedeschi told RAI state TV.

The transport minister, Danilo Toninelli, earlier said the collapse was likely ""an enormous tragedy.""

""We are following minute by minute the situation of the bridge collapse in Genoa,"" Interior Minister Matteo Salvini wrote on Twitter.

Tedeschi said two people were pulled from the rubble alive as rescuers searched the scene for survivors.

The exact cause of the collapse was unclear, though a witness said he saw lightning strike the structure, which fell apart soon after.

""It was just after 11:30 a.m. when we saw the lighting bolt hit the bridge and we saw the bridge go down,"" witness Pietro M. told ANSA.



Authorities earlier said they suspected there was a structural weakness.

Images posted by state police and witnesses showed a huge section of the bridge missing and crushed trucks and cars. Parts of the structure also landed on the rooftops of nearby buildings. Video captured the sound of a man screaming: ""Oh, God, oh, God!""

Firefighters said they are concerned about gas lines in the area.

The bridge was inaugurated in 1967 and is about 0.6 miles long. It's an interchange between the northern regions of Lombardy and Piedmont and the beaches of Liguria.

The collapse also occurred on the eve of Ferragosto, a major Italian holiday. Authorities said traffic on the bridge was expected to be higher than usual because many people travel to beaches or mountains during the holiday.

Two years before the deadly collapse, an engineer said the bridge was bound for disaster. Antonio Brencich, who is also a professor at the University of Genoa, said in July 2016 that there were problems with the structure, Ingegneri.info reported.

"A Missouri woman who traveled to Australia last August to visit a man she met online was caught smuggling cocaine -- inside the heels of her shoes, officials said.

Denise Marie Woodrum, 51, was busted while going through customs at the Sydney Airport on Aug. 4 last year. She was stopped by officers who discovered two pounds of cocaine in her luggage, the Sydney Morning Herald reported Monday.

Woodrum, who is a lay associate with the Catholic order Adorers of the Blood of Christ, claims she was duped by a man named Hendrick Cornelius and that the items in her luggage were meant for him.

“She was groomed to provide financial gain for this person, Hendrick Cornelius, whatever person or persons it was behind this identity,” her lawyer Rebecca Neil said in court last week, the newspaper reported. “She went on this trip, she was bringing artifacts for him.”

A spokesperson for the Adorers of the Blood of Christ told Fox News on Wednesday that Woodrum was known to them for at least five years and that she was not a nun or a sister with the order, as previously reported.

Cheryl Wittenauer, communications director for the Adorers of the Blood of Christ in St. Louis, said a lay associate with the order is someone who is inspired by the spirituality of a particular order and seeks to follow it in their private life. She said Woodrum once considered becoming a nun, but decided against it.

According to Woodrum, she had crippling debt due to major health problems and a failed marriage. She thought the man she met online was someone special.

However, despite exchanging hundreds of text with this mystery man, Woodrum never met him face to face. Her lawyer claims the 51-year-old was a “vulnerable” woman who had been preyed on.

In January, Woodrum pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug. However, Judge Penelope Wass has questioned Woodrum’s explanation, saying it’s “inconsistent and at times unbelievable.”

According to court documents, Woodrum flew from Missouri to Texas and then to Trinidad and Tobago on July 18, 2017. From there she traveled to the Suriname capital city of Paramaribo.

On July 30 – still in the South American country – Woodrum reportedly texted Cornelius: “Riding in his car to get stuff no signature needed.” That same day she traveled back to the U.S. via Trinidad and Tobago.

On August 2, she texted Cornelius a list of expenses and departed to Sydney from Miami via Los Angeles.

“It’s been a pleasure serving together…” Woodrum reportedly texted after landing.

Stopped at the Sydney airport, Woodrum reportedly told officers she traveled to the Australian city to see the Harbour Bridge and the aquarium. She said the shoes in her suitcase were a gift for her mother.

A substance was reportedly detected inside the heel of a shoe, a wallet and buttons on clothing.

After the shoes tested positive for cocaine, Woodrum reportedly replied: “Why, how much did you find?”

She later told investigators she’d been given gifts and clothes in South America to give to people in Sydney.

All the while, Cornelius was reportedly sending her messages that read: “Are you OK?” “What are you doing honey?” “Shuttle?” “In taxi?”

Woodrum has remained in custody since her arrest and is due to be sentenced early next month.

Meanwhile, Woodrum’s father told the Fairfax Media that his daughter’s arrest was a “big shock to the whole family.”

“It just came out of the blue,” Tom Rozanski, who lives in Illinois, added.

He said his daughter was a former teacher with a master’s degree in marketing, who suffered from depression and had undergone a hysterectomy.

“All of a sudden she met someone she talked to,” Rozanski said. “She said she was going to be doing some traveling.”

He added: “Life took a turn. She has never done anything like this before, and this experience has been difficult for me to understand. Mostly because none of our family has had anything happen to them that even remotely resembles what Denise has done.""

"The Justice Department filed court documents Thursday morning siding with a group of Asian-American students who allege Harvard discriminates against their race in its admissions process.

The Statement of Interest was filed in an ongoing case in federal court in Massachusetts.

“No American should be denied admission to school because of their race. As a recipient of taxpayer dollars, Harvard has a responsibility to conduct its admissions policy without racial discrimination by using meaningful admissions criteria that meet lawful requirements,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “The Department of Justice has the responsibility to protect the civil rights of the American people. This case is significant because the admissions policies at our colleges and universities are important and must be conducted lawfully.”

Students for Fair Admissions filed the suit, claiming the prestigious university discriminates against Asian-Americans.

DOJ officials noted that Harvard receives millions of dollars in taxpayer funding every year, while agreeing not to discriminate on the basis of race.

The government said the plaintiffs have “presented compelling evidence that Harvard’s use of race unlawfully discriminates against Asian Americans,” urging the court to grant the plaintiffs the opportunity to prove these claims at trial.

The statement of interest specifically argued that Harvard acknowledges using race as a factor in admissions – as part of affirmative action – but alleged the university “has failed to carry its demanding burden to show that its use of race does not inflict unlawful racial discrimination on Asian Americans.”

Harvard, meanwhile, has defended its policies.

“Harvard will continue to vigorously defend its right, and that of all colleges and universities, to consider race as one factor among many in college admissions, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court for more than 40 years,” a Harvard spokesperson told Fox News earlier this summer.

And liberal groups blasted the Justice Department.

“The Sessions Justice Department’s intervention in this case opposes constitutionally sound strategies that colleges and universities are using to expand educational opportunity for students of all backgrounds,” said Vanita Gupta, president of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “This is one more example of the administration’s contempt for efforts to build a more inclusive, just society.”

According to the lawsuit against Harvard, Asian-Americans consistently rated lower on subjective categories such as “courage” as well as “personality,” which decreased their chances of being accepted.

But the school said its “comprehensive” analysis showed no discrimination.",politics
"The Pentagon warned in a startling new report that China is likely training for bombing strikes against U.S. targets, while developing its nuclear capabilities.

The revelations come in the Pentagon’s 2018 report to Congress on “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” which focuses on developments in 2017.

Overall, the report found that China wants to leverage its economic, diplomatic and strategic strength to “establish regional preeminence and expand the country’s international influence.”

Militarily, the report said the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been developing capabilities in “overwater bomber operating areas” and is “gaining experience in critical maritime regions and likely training for strikes against U.S. and allied targets.”

This is part of a broader commitment to strengthening the PLA so it can operate farther away from China.

The report also found that China is advancing “an ambitious agenda of military modernization and organizational reforms.” Part of that involves the PLA’s Air Force being reassigned a nuclear mission, which would “provide China with a nuclear ‘triad’ of delivery systems dispersed across land, sea, and air.”

In May, China landed a long-range nuclear-capable bomber on an island in the disputed South China Sea, a move that raised tensions in the region due to a prior commitment by China not to militarize the area.

Tensions have been rising between China and the U.S. for months amid an escalating trade war between the two countries. The Trump administration is also mulling a Space Force in order to counter threats in space from countries including China.

CHINESE LAND BOMBER IN SOUTH CHINA SEA, POTENTIALLY ESCALATING TENSIONS OVER DISPUTED ZONE

The new report said that China’s space program “continues to mature rapidly” and is also developing counterspace capabilities to “degrade and deny adversary use of space-based assets during a crisis or conflict.”

The report also found that China’s relationship with North Korea has reached “the lowest level in decades” as it works on a dual track approach that uses both dialogue and pressure on the rogue regime over its nuclear capabilities.

"Prior to taking a plea deal regarding campaign finance violations as well as bank and tax fraud, Michael Cohen was a trusted member of the Trump Organization, personal attorney and “fixer” to the president.

He helped raise millions of dollars for Trump’s campaign and once loyally proclaimed he does “everything in [his] power to resolve” any issue for his boss.

Read on for a look back at how the case against Cohen started and the events that led up to his plea deal.

Aug. 22 – Trump bashes Cohen on social media

Trump seemingly implied Cohen fabricated “stories in order to get a ‘deal’” in a tweet that referenced Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman who was convicted of eight bank and tax fraud charges on the same day Cohen pleaded guilty.

“If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen!” Trump also tweeted.

Aug. 21 – Cohen pleads guilty to 8 criminal counts, implicates Trump

Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law as well as tax evasion and making false statements to a financial institution.

Cohen could have received up to 65 years in prison if convicted of all charges. However, as part of his plea deal, Cohen agreed not to challenge any sentence between 46 and 63 months. The deal does not involve a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors.

Lanny Davis, Cohen’s attorney, said his client is “more than happy” to tell Mueller “all that he knows.” He told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Cohen has knowledge that would be “of interest” to Mueller’s investigation.

Aug. 19 – Bank fraud investigation revealed in reports

The New York Times reported federal investigators were probing whether Cohen committed bank fraud on more than $20 million worth of loans as well as violated campaign finance laws.

Particularly, investigators were looking into the possibility Cohen misrepresented assets in order to obtain loans from Sterling National Bank and the Melrose Credit Union. At issue, as well, was how Cohen’s company handled dozens of taxi medallions and if income from those were properly reported to the Internal Revenue Service.

The Times report also said prosecutors were looking into whether Cohen violated campaign finance laws by securing deals with women who claimed they had affairs with Trump.

July 24 – Tape of Cohen and Trump discussing payments released

A recording of Trump and Cohen discussing a payment to a woman who said she had an affair with the real estate mogul was leaked. Cohen has been accused of secretly recording Trump.

Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, said she had a “consensual, loving relationship” with Trump in 2006. She was paid $150,000 to kill her story of the alleged relationship; the White House has denied the affair.

PAUL MANAFORT TRIAL TESTED MUELLER, TRUMP: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE CASE

On the recording, which was made prior to the 2016 presidential election, Cohen tells Trump: “I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David,"" adding he has consulted Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg ""about how to set the whole thing up.”

Cohen told Trump, “We’ll have to pay,” and Trump said something about paying “with cash,” although that part of the audio is not clear. Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani later told Fox News Trump was telling Cohen, “Don’t pay with cash.”

July 2 – Cohen puts his family first

Cohen began to seemingly distance himself from the president in an interview with ABC News as he stressed his family is his first priority.

“My wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will,” he said. “I put family and country first.”

Cohen also said, “I will not be a punching bag as part of anyone’s defense strategy. I am not a villain of this story, and I will not allow others to try to depict me that way.”

He also reportedly told ABC he does not like the term “witch hunt” – which Trump has repeatedly used to describe the Russia investigation – and said he doesn’t agree with those who “demonize or vilify the FBI.”

June 20 – Cohen resigns from RNC post

Cohen stepped down from his position as deputy finance chair of the Republican National Committee’s Finance Committee, citing the ongoing investigation.

June 15 – Trump expresses confidence in Cohen

In a testy exchange with reporters outside the White House, Trump said he was not “worried” because he “did nothing wrong.”

Trump also said while he hadn’t spoken to Cohen in “a long time,"" he thought Cohen was a “good person.”

“I’ve always liked Michael,” he said.

May 22 – Cohen’s associate pleads guilty

Evgeny Friedman, known as the “taxi king” in New York, pleaded guilty to pocketing $5 million in passenger fees that were supposed to help fund public transportation. Friedman at one time managed cabs Cohen owned, according to The Washington Post.

Part of his plea agreement required him to cooperate with any ongoing investigation, The Associated Press reported.

Cohen distanced himself from Friedman on social media, saying the pair had “never been partners in this business or any other.”

May 11 – Cohen no longer Trump’s attorney, Giuliani says

Giuliani told Politico Cohen no longer represented Trump as his personal attorney.

“As far as we know, he’s not,” Giuliani said. “And there’s nothing for him to do right now.”

April 27 – Judge puts Stormy Daniels lawsuit on hold

A federal judge decided to put the lawsuit against Cohen – brought by Stormy Daniels – on hold for 90 days. Judge S. James Otero said he came to the decision because the civil case would most likely overlap with the criminal investigation.

Days prior, Cohen formally moved to plead the Fifth in the case.

April 26 – Special master appointed to oversee Cohen’s documents

A federal judge decided to appoint a so-called special master tasked with overseeing the handling of information and materials seized from Cohen.

U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood had previously denied Cohen’s team the opportunity to review the information taken.

April 11 – Cohen would ""rather jump out of building"" than turn on Trump

Cohen reportedly said he would “rather jump out of a building than turn on Donald Trump,” The New York Times reporter Michael M. Grynbaum wrote on Twitter.

Cohen reportedly made the remarks over lunch with executive and television personality Donny Deutsch.

April 9 – FBI raids Cohen’s home, office

The FBI raided Cohen’s home, office and a hotel room and confiscated documents related to his finances, taxi company and payments made to women who alleged affairs with Trump.

In particular, investigators sought information relating to the $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels – whose real name is Stephanie Clifford – who claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 while he was married to Melania. She alleged she was paid by Cohen in 2016 ahead of the presidential election.

Trump has denied the affair. Of the raid, he expressed his anger on social media, saying “attorney-client privilege is dead.”

"Detectives in Jamaica are closing in on “persons of interest” in the brutal murders of a British couple — as grim details of their final moments emerged Monday.

The couple were found murdered on Friday near their eight-bedroom home in Mount Pleasant, Jamaica, just weeks after they complained of being caught up in a credit card fraud of more than $66,000.

Sources on the Caribbean island confirmed that Gayle Anderson, 71, had her hair burnt off when she was found dead 20 feet from her luxury retirement home.

The body of her husband-of-55 years Charlie, 74, was discovered more than 130 feet from the eight-bedroom house, down a slope and with burns to the genitals.

Both had face and neck wounds — with locals claiming the pair had been stabbed.

Bafflingly, the couple’s windows had been removed from the outside prior to the murders and the living room had been set alight.

A senior investigative source in Jamaica told The Sun: “We have a lot of strands to put together — some of them we just can’t explain yet.""

“Mrs. Anderson was discovered 20 feet in front of the house and on the couple’s property. She was lying on her back and her body had been partially, although not severely, burned.

“Her hair was burned off, but her face was visible. And her clothes were burned with some material sticking to her body.

“Mr. Anderson was found (more than 130 feet) from the house, but still on the couple’s land. He and his clothing were also burned — it was concentrated around the genitalia area.

“There were pieces of burnt clothing between his body and the house, like he had been on fire and was getting away from the building. He was found towards the end of a long slope. One of the rooms in the house was also burned, their living room which I believe they also used to cook in while they did construction work on another part of the home.”

"Members of the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday were heard groaning and saying, “Oh, my God,” when their meeting was broken up with news of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement.

Politico reported-- citing an audio recording-- that the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee was interrupted by the news alert that was followed with one person saying, “This is not good news.”

Without Kennedy, 81-- who is often seen as a voice of moderation over three decades-- the court will be split between four liberal justices and four conservatives, and the next President Trump pick.

Several former law clerks have said that Kennedy, a nominee of President Ronald Reagan, preferred to be replaced by a Republican. If he had waited, and if Democrats had taken control of the Senate in November, Trump could have found it more difficult to get his choice confirmed.

The retirement of Kennedy—whose votes have decided issues on abortion, affirmative action, gay rights, guns, campaign finance and voting rights—gives President Trump an opportunity to tip the balance in the conservatives’ favor.

The New York Times editorial board called Kennedy's decision “crushing.”

""It is a dark moment in the history of the court and the nation, and it’s about to get a lot darker."" - The New York Times editorial board

""It is a dark moment in the history of the court and the nation, and it’s about to get a lot darker,"" the editorial wrote.

Trump said he would start the effort to replace Kennedy “immediately"" and would pick from a list of 25 names that he updated last year.

""It's a game changer,"" said Republican strategist Chris Wilson. ""There's no piece of legislation, no executive order, no Supreme Court decision that would have created the level of motivation that an empty seat does.""

Campaigning officially began in Macedonia on Monday for a Sept. 30 referendum on changing the country's name, a move which would allow the Balkan country to qualify for NATO membership and also pave its way toward the European Union.

Macedonians will vote on a proposal to change the former Yugoslav republic's name to North Macedonia, in a bid to end a long-running dispute with neighbor and NATO member Greece which saw use of the term ""Macedonia"" as a claim on its own province of the same name.

The proposed change met with fierce criticism in the two countries, with opponents on both sides accusing their governments of conceding too much to the other country. Macedonian parliamentary Speaker Talat Xhaferi recently urged politicians to conduct their campaigns ""transparently, directly, without discrimination, prejudice and with respect of every citizen.""

The question voters will be called to decide on is: ""Are you in favor of membership in the European Union and NATO by accepting the deal between Republic of Macedonia and Republic of Greece?""

Polls indicate Macedonians will likely back the deal, but it remains unclear whether turnout will meet the required 50 percent threshold for the vote to be valid.

Western leaders who visited Macedonia last week, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have urged Macedonians to back the deal.

""This is a historic chance that a generation has only once. Don't stay at home: Seize the democratic opportunity to say what you think about the future of your country,"" Merkel said last week at a joint news conference with Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has also urged Macedonians to approve the deal with Greece, noting it is the only way for the country to join NATO.

""The idea that there is an alternative way where you can reject the name agreement with Greece and join NATO is an absolute and total illusion,"" Stoltenberg warned.

The main conservative opposition VMRO-DPMNE party and Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov have repeatedly said Macedonia's strategic goal is to join NATO and the EU, but that they oppose the deal with Greece, warning it will damage the country's national interests.

Zaev, for his part, has expressed optimism on the outcome of the referendum.

""The European Union and NATO are ahead of us. That is our goal on this last section of the road that we build together since our independence,"" Zaev said during a rally in the town of Bitola late Sunday, before the official start of campaigning. ""This is our future, this is our choice and your decision on Sept 30 will secure our place in the EU and NATO.""

A total of 64 smaller political parties and civic associations are campaigning against the deal, joining together in an opposition front called ""Macedonia is boycotting.""

The agreement with Greece was signed in June, and also requires changes to the Macedonian Constitution. The final step for the country to join NATO would be ratification of the deal by Greece's parliament, which would vote only after Macedonia has completed all of its necessary procedures.",world
"An Indonesian mother has died after being swallowed whole by a 23-foot-long python.

The woman, Wa Tiba, 54, went missing while tending to her vegetable garden near her village on Muna Island in Southeast Sulawesi province on Thursday, according to the village chief, Faris.

When her family went to look for her, they found only her belongings in the garden, including her sandals, a machete and a flashlight.

The village subsequently launched a search for her but were horrified to find the python with a severely bloated belly just 50 yards from the garden.

"Sen. Lindsey Graham ripped the FBI this week over an alleged double standard in how the bureau handled a suspected Chinese spy on Sen. Dianne Feinstein's staff versus how it handled Russian contacts with Trump campaign advisers years later.

As revealed in recent press reports, the FBI briefed the Democratic senator about the alleged Chinese spy, who was then removed from her office.

By contrast, the bureau seemingly kept then-candidate Donald Trump in the dark on the Russia suspicions -- launching a case that would later be taken over by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

“Although I appreciate the FBI’s diligence in identifying the staffer with potential ties to the Chinese government and providing Senator Feinstein with a defensive briefing, I am deeply troubled that the Trump Campaign was not afforded the same treatment when the FBI began to suspect that campaign staffers George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, Michael Flynn, and Paul Manafort had improper ties to the Russian government,” Republican Sen. Graham, of South Carolina, wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray.

“It appears that rather than provide then-candidate Donald Trump or Trump Campaign officials with a defensive briefing to inform them of the FBI’s concerns, the Bureau opted to use a confidential informant and a dossier funded by the Democratic National Committee to launch an unprecedented counterintelligence investigation into the Trump Campaign,” Graham continued.

Reports about the alleged Chinese spy in Feinstein’s San Francisco office surfaced earlier this month, though the incident took place roughly five years ago. The staffer reportedly served as Feinstein’s driver, but also took on additional responsibilities in the office, such as working as a liaison to the Asian-American community in California.

The staffer reportedly attended Chinese consulate events on behalf of the senator and was recruited after being befriended by someone from China’s Ministry of State Security.

“Five years ago the FBI informed me it had concerns that an administrative member of my California staff was potentially being sought out by the Chinese government to provide information,” Feinstein said in a statement earlier this month. “He was not a mole or a spy, but someone who a foreign intelligence service thought it could recruit.”

Feinstein said that the FBI “reviewed the matter” and “shared its concerns” with her. The staffer was then immediately removed from her office. Feinstein claimed that the staffer “never had access” to classified or sensitive information.

“The FBI never informed me of any compromise of national security information,” she said.

Graham is not the only member of Congress to complain about the FBI’s approach to both cases. The senator cited a Fox News report from earlier this month, where House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., made a similar statement.

“Providing a defensive briefing, like the one given to Senator Feinstein, is a typical response to these kinds of situations,” Nunes said in a statement to Fox News. “The refusal to give the Trump campaign a defensive briefing, and instead opening a sprawling counter-intelligence investigation of American citizens, is one of many alarming ways that intelligence leaders drastically diverged from normal procedures in their Trump campaign investigation.”

Graham pressed the FBI to divulge the specific protocol for briefing politicians and campaigns about “potential espionage threats” over the last 10 years, and pressed for an answer to why the bureau treated Trump differently than Feinstein.

Graham also is requesting information as to what defensive briefings, if any, were given to Trump or his campaign when concerns about his staffers arose.

One retired FBI special agent and former national spokesman who served at the bureau during the time of the Feinstein investigation, but not specifically on the case, John Iannarelli, told Fox News that the procedure could have been different based on the narrow scope of the Feinstein allegations.

“The Feinstein investigation was very narrow, in terms of who their target was, whereas the Trump investigation appears to be much broader,” Iannarelli told Fox News.

He also suggested that the FBI trusted Feinstein with the information.

“When you’re conducting a public corruption investigation, if you’re looking at someone who’s working for the official but have nothing to indicate that the official is involved, you may notify the official to prevent the investigation from being compromised,” he said.

Earlier this month, the FBI declined to comment on why Trump was not given the same kind of briefing as Feinstein when the investigation began and when Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants were obtained against Page.",politics
"I was one of a group of black faith leaders from inner cities who attended a meeting with President Trump at the White House Wednesday to talk about the importance of the church in building community – especially in the area of prison reform and workforce development for former prisoners.

Unfortunately, the political and cultural climate in our country has plummeted to such a petty and disturbing place that I fully expected I might be attacked afterwards. Nevertheless, I accepted the invitation. I believe that the ability to help others who are marginalized, disenfranchised and voiceless is an important pursuit, and I remain committed to the cause of Christ beyond pettiness and politics.

Sadly, my fears were realized when I and some of the other leaders were attacked after this meeting – both in our churches, our local communities and from others nationally. Our statements, and even the opening prayer, came under intense scrutiny and our remarks were also taken out of context in order to generate click-bait headlines.

Much has been made about my thanking President Trump for “caring for all people.” Some individuals have misconstrued that statement to conclude I was giving a blanket endorsement of everything the president has done. That was not the intent of my statement.

I am on record as disagreeing with President Trump, including on aspects of his immigration policy. However, I would happily hop on a plane to Washington again if I were invited to sit down and talk through other issues that will help the disenfranchised, marginalized and voiceless...

The president expressed to us that he is concerned about the incredible challenges our prisoners and former prisoners face under the current system. He said his administration is currently working on prison reform legislation to help.

I thanked President Trump for this and for “caring for all people,” meaning I am encouraged and hopeful about his desire for prison reform, his wish to help the formerly incarcerated, and his determination to partner with the faith-based community on important issues affecting the community.

On other issues, I am on record as disagreeing with President Trump, including on aspects of his immigration policy. However, I would happily hop on a plane to Washington again if I were invited to sit down and talk through other issues that will help the disenfranchised, marginalized and voiceless, like I did on at our meeting this week.

But what is most disturbing about the reaction to Wednesday’s meeting is that it shows the vitriol and contempt that is present even when President Trump’s efforts are positive and will clearly help those who need it most (his First Step Act prison reform legislation has strong bipartisan support).

My prayer is that we no longer sacrifice the people who need help the most on the altar of our egos and political ideology. We don’t have to agree on all things – in fact we might only agree on a few things – but I still believe we can work together for the betterment of this country, its citizens and our communities.

As a Christian, my ultimate example is Jesus, and in the spirit of the popular bracelets from years ago I think we have to ask the question: “What would Jesus do?” This answer is simple. He would work to make a difference in the lives of people, regardless of who is in the White House. I pray that we do likewise.",politics
"Investigations into his tax returns, his payments to Stormy Daniels and his relationship with Russia.

That’s what President Trump will almost assuredly face if Democrats win back the House -- and the much-coveted power to subpoena and launch congressional investigations.

Democrats need to flip 23 seats to take back control and give Nancy Pelosi another crack at wielding the gavel, and the party of the sitting president typically loses seats in the first post-inauguration midterms.

The anti-Trump 'resistance' already is preparing for robust political payback, should Democrats succeed.

“Another reason the Midterm elections matter — if Democrats take back the House they will have the power to launch investigations, subpoena witnesses, and hold public hearings on all of Trump’s criminal activity,” Nate Lerner, the executive director of the liberal campaign group Build the Wave, tweeted Monday.

Capitol Hill Republicans, meanwhile, are circulating a long list of issues they believe Democrats could investigate should they win the House, Axios reported over the weekend.

The list, which documents information requests already made by the minority party, predicts Democrats could launch investigations into Trump’s family business, Trump’s firing of FBI director James Comey, the personal email use of White House staff and White House security clearances, among many other issues.

“Everything gets investigated,” former Republican House Oversight Committee chairman Tom Davis recently told the Washington Post. “You spend half your time answering subpoenas, digging up documents and having your people appear before these committees.”

Pro-Trump conservatives are raising alarm about the list.

“It is a road map to the full weaponization of government,” former Republican congressional candidate Dan Bongino said Monday on “Fox & Friends.” “And frankly, it's one of the most frightening things I have seen in a very long time.”

But there’s precedent to the opposition party winning back control of the House -- mostly recently in 2010, when Republicans rode the Tea Party wave to a House majority -- and becoming a major thorn in the side of the president.

That 2010 win ignited a slew of investigations on the House Oversight Committee, under Republican chairmen Darrell Issa and Jason Chaffetz, of Obama-era scandals, including the Benghazi attacks, the Fast and Furious operation and the IRS targeting of conservative groups.

TRUMP SAYS MARKET WOULD CRASH IF DEMS IMPEACHED HIM

It’s possible Democrats will also move to impeach Trump should they win back control – an effort already embraced by some left-wing lawmakers. Top House Democrats have largely pushed back on calls to pursue that option, though some have kept the door open.

But the speculation over a possible impeachment effort ramped up again last week following the plea deal struck by Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen, who claims the president was involved in hush-money payments and admitted campaign finance violations related to them.

The president himself, in an interview on Fox News last week, dismissed talk of impeachment, saying, “I don’t know how you can impeach somebody who’s done a great job” while warning of economic consequences.

“If I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, I think everybody would be very poor, because without this thinking, you would see — you would see numbers that you wouldn’t believe in reverse,” Trump said.

"Donald Trump is rapidly ratcheting up the rhetoric as the 2016 candidates charge out of their respective party conventions, warning Monday the November presidential election could be “rigged” and repeatedly calling Democratic rival Hillary Clinton “the devil” – while his campaign tried to draw financial links between the Clinton Foundation and ISIS.

Speaking Tuesday morning to Fox Business Network, the Republican nominee also called Clinton a “disaster” and a “liar.”

“She lied over the weekend,” Trump said, citing her widely challenged claim to “Fox News Sunday” that the FBI director determined her statements on her personal email use were “truthful.”

The onslaught of accusations – signaling a new and tougher phase in a campaign already characterized by sharp elbows and name-calling – picked up late Monday, as Trump railed against his general election rival during stops in Ohio and later Pennsylvania, and in media interviews. He went so far as to suggest November could be fixed.

""I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest,"" the Republican nominee told a town hall crowd in Columbus, Ohio, on Monday. He added that he has been hearing ""more and more"" that the election may not be contested fairly, though he did not elaborate further.

Trump made the claim after first suggesting that the Democrats had fixed their primary system so Clinton could defeat Sen. Bernie Sanders.

He repeated the charge Monday night on Fox News Channel's ""Hannity,"" saying: ""November 8th, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us.""

Speaking at a stop Monday night in Pennsylvania, Trump did not mince words as he also blasted Sanders for backing Clinton.

“If he would have just not done anything, go home, go to sleep, relax, he would have been a hero. But he made a deal with the devil. She's the devil. He made a deal with the devil. It's true,” Trump said.

So far, Clinton has not responded directly to Trump’s latest jabs. She’s focusing her fire on Trump’s controversial comments about Khizr and Ghazala Khan -- Muslims whose U.S. Army captain son was killed in Iraq in 2004 -- and Trump’s business record.

""For the life of me I don't know why someone runs to be president of the United States who thinks and says we don't win anymore, our country is full of losers,” Clinton said Monday in Nebraska.

The Khans spoke out against Trump and questioned his familiarity with the Constitution last week at the Democratic National Convention. Trump struck back by questioning whether Ghazala Khan had been allowed to speak. She said she is still too grief-stricken by her son's death.

Trump has since faced bipartisan criticism for his comments.

Meanwhile, the Trump campaign put out a statement late Monday alleging Clinton Foundation ties to a corporation “funding” ISIS.

The campaign detailed financial contributions the Clinton Foundation received from a cement-making company called Lafarge. The same statement cited reporting in French media outlets that the company had entered deals with the Islamic State and other armed groups in Syria to protect its interests there.

“More than any major presidential nominee in modern history, Hillary Clinton is tied to brutal theocratic and Islamist regimes. Now we learn she has accepted money from a company linked to ISIS,” Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said in a statement.

"The Justice Department on Wednesday announced Attorney General Jeff Sessions will convene a meeting with state attorneys general this month to discuss long-standing concerns by conservatives that social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are ""stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.""

The announcement came after a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing involving top officials from Facebook and Twitter, and ahead of a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on alleged bias and lack of transparency, where Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testified.

“The Attorney General has convened a meeting with a number of state attorneys general this month to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms,” the statement said.

There was no date set for the meeting. And it was not immediately clear how many attorneys general would attend the meeting.

The Senate hearing focused primarily on the use of social media by Russia and other foreign actors in the 2016 election, with executives promising to do more to combat such meddling in the future.

But President Trump and a number of Republicans have prioritized concern that tech companies discriminate against conservatives with bias in treatment and so-called “shadow banning.”

FACEBOOK, TWITTER ISSUE MEA CULPAS ON FAILURE TO SPOT RUSSIAN MEDDLING

“What we’re concerned about is how Twitter has in some ways it looks like selectively, adversely affected conservatives,” Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said at the House hearing.

He used the example of Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who he said had her Senate campaign announcement video taken down by Twitter. Dorsey said that action was a mistake, which was corrected, and prompted an apology from Twitter.

In his opening remarks, Dorsey pushed back against the idea Twitter was biased by its creator’s personal opinions. But he conceded mistakes were made in terms of its algorithms.



“I want to start by making something clear: we don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives, or party affiliation in any of our policies or enforcement decisions. Period,” he said. “Impartiality is our guiding principle.”



Trump has repeatedly claimed social media platforms are biased against Republicans and conservatives. In an interview with The Daily Caller this week, he said social media companies had backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.



“Maybe I did a better job because I’m good with the Twitter and I’m good at social media, but the truth is they were all on Hillary Clinton’s side, and if you look at what was going on with Facebook and with Google and all of it, they were very much on her side,” he said.

"What in the world has happened to the Democratic party’s approach to illegal immigration over the last dozen years?

Twelve years ago, during a Senate floor debate in October 2006, freshman U.S. Senator Barack Obama supported construction of a physical barrier along the southwest border. “The bill before us will certainly do some good,” he said, before speaking approvingly of a barrier’s ability to “help stem the tide of illegal immigration in this country.”

Today, leading Democrats – including potential candidates for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination – have done a 180-degree reversal. They now oppose construction of a physical barrier, and even demand the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the law enforcement agency responsible for enforcing the laws on the books and removing illegal immigrants.

What happened to the Democratic party in the intervening years? In a word, politics.

Back in 2006, when the Secure Fence Act was being considered in the Senate, Democratic party leaders envisioned a difficult presidential election in 2008. They wanted to secure their right flank against charges of being weak on illegal immigration. Supporting construction of a physical barrier seemed the thing to do. So 26 Democratic senators – including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Chuck Schumer – voted for it.

But that was then, and this is now.

As they look to 2020 and the chance to take on Donald Trump, they know that before they can engage Trump in the fall, they’ll first have to win their party’s nomination. The Democratic party nomination process is heavily influenced by the hard left, and they know it.

Is it really any wonder so many voters, fed up with a party that had abandoned them in search of new voters, decided to abandon the party of their fathers and grandfathers and pulled a lever for – gasp! – Donald Trump

The hard left hates Donald Trump. The hard left doesn’t want anything to do with Donald Trump. The hard left would turn down anything and everything – universal health care under the guise of “Medicare for all,” or even a universal basic wage (that is, free money from other taxpayers) – if they believed it came from Trump.

If Trump touches it, they reason, it must be bad.

How do I know? Because we all saw the perfect example of this play out earlier this year when President Trump offered Democrats – who were seeking to institutionalize President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program – a path to citizenship (their highest demand!) for THREE TIMES as many illegal immigrants as they had ever hoped to bargain for (!). But there was one hitch – Trump wanted funding for a border wall.

And congressional Democrats knew that the hard left would never let them get away with voting to fund construction of a border wall that might actually reduce the number of illegal border crossings, even if would let them legalize and set on a path to citizenship almost 2 million illegal immigrants. So the Democrats turned him down.

Meanwhile, hard left activists focused on generating energy and excitement for hard left candidates in Democratic party primary elections. They upped their demands on the immigration front – not only did they demand their candidates oppose construction of a physical barrier at the border and support citizenship for illegal immigrants, they wanted to abolish ICE entirely.

When Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stunned the political world by knocking off incumbent U.S. Rep. Joe Crowley – the fourth-ranking House Democrat, and a potential future Speaker of the House – in her June primary election upset, and then brandished her demand to abolish ICE, the movement to eliminate this crucial law enforcement agency took off. Potential candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand joined the effort, House Democrats introduced legislation to terminate the agency, and leftist candidates all over the country took up the rallying cry.

Here’s the terrible secret about the Democrats’ switch – in going all-in for legalizing illegal immigrants and eliminating the federal law enforcement authority responsible for removing those who have violated our laws: they have betrayed their own lower-income and working class constituents.

Do lower-income U.S. citizens benefit when the terrible schools they’re forced to send their children to see class sizes swell with non-English speaking students? Do working class U.S. citizens benefit when their jobs are taken by illegal immigrants willing to work off the books at far lower costs to their employers? Are any of them benefited when social services must be rationed to accommodate the new illegal immigrant recipients?

Democrats, ask yourselves: Is it really any wonder so many of them, fed up with a party that had abandoned them in search of new voters, decided to abandon the party of their fathers and grandfathers and pulled a lever for – gasp! – Donald Trump, the candidate who was the most anti-establishment candidate of the last generation?

I guess the next elections will tell us whether it was all worth it – but make no mistake what is behind this complete reversal: in a word, politics.",politics
"President Trump on Tuesday said Democrats are ""looking to inflict pain and embarrassment"" on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as day one of the judge's confirmation hearings was delayed by more than an hour because of protests from ""the other side.""

""The Brett Kavanaugh hearings for the future Justice of the Supreme Court are truly a display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is,"" the president tweeted, adding that they'll ""say anything.""

Referring to Kavanaugh, 53, as ""one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress,"" Trump said the political drama is ""So sad to see!""

The nominee's hearing was overtaken early Tuesday as Democratic lawmakers and protesters delayed its formal start by 77 minutes, and asked for more time to review roughly 42,000 documents the Senate Judiciary Committee received at the last minute.

CORNYN SAYS DEMOCRATS INTERRUPTING KAVANAUGH SUPREME COURT HEARING WOULD BE 'IN CONTEMPT OF COURT'

Two of the most vocal Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee were Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J. — both potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.

Harris, along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., motioned to adjourn and postpone the heading, but were rejected by Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.

Grassley said at the outset that he wanted to let those speak who had something to say, but seemingly became frustrated as the objections continued by Democrats.

“Can I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle how long you want to go on with this because I’m not going to entertain any of the motions you’re making, we’re not in executive session and I think we ought to level with the American people — do you want this to go on all day?” Grassley asked.

"Pushing filthy hands between the bars of his cell, Maluel Chol held up a small black plastic bag.

""This is where I go to the toilet,"" he said. The 28-year-old has been detained for six months in South Sudan's capital, accused of murder but not yet officially charged and with no access to a lawyer.

Hundreds of people detained in South Sudan face such treatment and far worse, a new Amnesty International report says, accusing authorities of torturing people to death and letting many others languish behind bars since civil war began in late 2013.

At least 20 people died in detention between 2014 and 2016 and four died last year because of harsh conditions and inadequate medical care, according to the report.

""It is extremely unconscionable that South Sudanese authorities arrest, torture and ill-treat people in total disregard for their human rights,"" said Seif Magango, Amnesty's deputy director for East Africa. He called on South Sudan's government to release political detainees or charge them.

Hundreds of people have been subject to prolonged and arbitrary detention without charge by the country's National Security Service and Military Intelligence Directorate, said the report, based on interviews with victims and witnesses. Suspected supporters of the armed opposition are increasingly targeted, it said.

One man suffered having his testicles pierced with sewing needles while being interrogated about the whereabouts of opposition leader Riek Machar, said the Amnesty report. Other detainees were made to drink water from the toilet and defecate and urinate in front of each other, while some were subjected to forced nudity and genital mutilation.

Last year one soldier died in detention while standing trial for a high-profile attack on a hotel in the capital, Juba, in 2016 in which foreigners said they were gang-raped and assaulted and a local journalist was shot dead.

South Sudan's government called the new Amnesty report ""rubbish"" and based on inaccurate information from social media.

""We don't have a culture of torturing people. We put you in prison to put you behind bars, not to beat you,"" government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told The Associated Press.

As part of a new peace deal, the government in August released more than 20 political prisoners.

Despite that act of good faith, South Sudan's political environment has become increasingly intolerant and any criticism of the government can lead to intimidation and detention, the new report says.

In July, academic and activist Peter Biar Ajak was arrested at Juba's international airport and accused of treason. He has been detained without charge since then without access to legal counsel or any communication with the outside world, a human rights lawyer involved with his case, Phillips Anyang Ngong, told AP.

""It's a situation that gives us fear for how the shrines of justice and the institutions concerned will be able to save us from this continued arbitrary arrest of people without charges,"" Ngong said.

According to South Sudan's Criminal Procedure Act, no one should be detained for longer than 24 hours while cases are investigated. The government has signed a U.N. convention against torture.

Even some prison officials acknowledge the system isn't working.

At the public prison in Juba more than half of the roughly 1,000 inmates have not been charged or have not had access to a lawyer, director-general Henry Kuany Aguar told the AP.

On a recent visit to a detention center on the outskirts of Juba, AP spoke with several inmates held for days and weeks in squalid conditions without being charged.

Two dozen men crammed into three cells lining a narrow, mud-spattered hallway in the county jail, which acts as a transition center before people are moved to prisons.

Hanging his head, inmate Maluel Chol said he had been transferred from cell to cell for months but had not appeared in court or seen a lawyer. Gripping the handle of an empty water jug in his cell, shared with six other men, he said he is discouraged: ""I'll just keep being moved around until I die.""

"Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, on Monday was confronted inside a restaurant in Washington, D.C., by a teacher holding her 2-year-old son.

The New York Post identified the woman as Kristin Mink, 33, and reported that the encounter was filmed by her husband at Teaism restaurant.

Mink reportedly teaches sixth grade at Sidwell Friends, the school where former President Obama's daughters attended.

“I had to decide what to say, he’s so scandal-ridden,” Mink told the paper. “I jotted down just a couple points that I wanted to make to him that were a little on the specific side.”

The latest encounter comes as Democrats appear divided on confronting Trump administration officials in public after high-profile episodes that included White House Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders and Kirstjen Nielsen, the head of the Department of Homeland Security.

The video shows Mink approach Pruitt, who was seated with another man at a table. Mink, at times, consulted her notes and asked him to step down due to his stance on the environment and mounting scandals.

“This is my son, he loves animals, he loves clean air, he loves clean water,” she said. “So I would urge you to resign before your scandals push you out.""

Pruitt faces a barrage of ethics complaints and federal inquiries.

The EPA's inspector general, the Government Accountability Office and the White House are investigating numerous allegations concerning Pruitt's spending on first-class travel and security, his dealings with subordinates and with lobbyists, and other matters.

A senior counsel for the EPA resigned last month just days after appearing before a panel of House oversight committee investigating allegations of mismanagement and spending at the EPA.

Pruitt has also been criticized in connection with the rental of a Capitol Hill condo tied to a prominent oil and gas lobbyist, and the use of first-class travel and luxury hotel suites, among other things.

Pruitt, in appearances before congressional hearings this spring, has denied responsibility for any ethical lapses, saying subordinates made those decisions.

Mink told The Post Pruitt did not say anything during the encounter and left right after she approached him.

Pruitt’s spokesman told the paper that the administrator did not leave because of the encounter, and thanked her.

“Administrator Pruitt always welcomes input from Americans, whether they agree or disagree with the decisions being made at EPA. This is evident by him listening to her comments and going on to thank her, which is not shown in the video,” the spokesman told The Post.

"President Trump signed a proclamation Wednesday night to send the National Guard to the southern border immediately, a senior White House official told Fox News, in response to what the administration described as an ""unacceptable"" flow of drugs, criminal activity and illegal immigrants.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said at the White House press briefing that the signing would be done in conjunction with governors and that the administration hoped the deployment would begin ""immediately.""

""Despite a number of steps this administration has taken...we continue to see unacceptable levels of illegal drugs, dangerous gang activity transnational criminal organizations and illegal immigration flow across our border,"" she said.

""The president has directed that the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security work together with our governors to deploy our National Guard to our southwest border to assist the border patrol,"" she said. ""The president will be signing a proclamation to that effect today.""

Details about what the National Guard would do and how many would be deployed and for how long were not immediately disclosed.

Under the George W. Bush administration, deploying the National Guard to the border cost $415 million dollars.

Nielsen pointed to what she described as increasing fraud and exploited loopholes among arrivals on the southern border, saying traffickers have been advertising that if migrants have children with them, then they are more likely to be released into the U.S. She also said that almost 50 percent of arriving aliens are from Central America.

""Traffickers and smugglers know that these individuals cannot under U.S. law be easily removed in an expeditious way back to their country of origin and so they exploit the loophole,"" she said, adding that the ability to game the system acts as a magnet for more migrants.

She said that the administration has drafted legislation and will ask Congress to provide legal authority and resources to address the problem.

""We will not allow illegal immigration levels to become the norm,"" she said. ""More than 1,000 people a day, 300,000 a year violating our sovereignty as a nation will never be acceptable to this president.""

Trump had tweeted earlier Wednesday that he would “be taking strong action today” on the Mexico border, a day after he said that he wants to send the military to secure it until a wall is built.

Arguing that the U.S. border laws “are very weak” compared to Mexico and Canada, he accused Democrats of wanting immigrants “to pour into our country unchecked.”

Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had deployed the National Guard to the border in response to security issues.

The Associated Press reported that the White House was considering a model similar to a Bush-era operation, where in 2006 6,000 National Guard troops were sent to assist the border patrol with non-law enforcement duties while additional border agents were hired and trained.

Trump's recent focus on illegal immigration appeared to have been partly motivated by a caravan of more than 1,000 Central American migrants heading toward the U.S. border.

Trump had threatened to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and to cut foreign aid to countries such as Honduras, from where many of the migrants originate, if the caravan was not stopped.

Trump said Tuesday that he believes the caravan is being broken up after he had a conversation with Mexican officials.

Nielsen said on Tuesday that she had been advised by Mexican officials that “the caravan is dissipating” and that several hundred migrants had been repatriated.

“We will not accept the lawlessness of these types of efforts and those who choose to violate our laws, and those who conspire to assist others to violate our laws, will face criminal prosecution,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. “The Department of Justice fully supports the efforts of the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security announced today to secure our border. I will soon be announcing additional Department of Justice initiatives to restore legality to the southern border.”

"President Trump reveled in the backlash Nike is facing over making Colin Kaepernick the face of its “Just Do It” campaign, tweeting Wednesday that the sneaker giant is “getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts.”

The president, who played a major role pressuring the NFL to crack down on players protesting police violence and other issues by kneeling during the national anthem, compared Nike’s predicament to the football league’s.

“Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG!” he tweeted.

Kaepernick began kneeling during the anthem during a 2016 pre-season game when he was a member of the San Francisco 49ers to protest racial injustices and police brutality. The now-former quarterback was announced Monday as the face of a new ad campaign to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Nike’s “Just Do It” slogan.

The company faced a swift backlash from some former customers. Videos and photos showed fans destroying their Nike-branded apparel, with some going as far as letting the gear go up in flames.

The decision drew support elsewhere, though, including from ex-CIA Director John Brennan.

“Colin Kaepernick drew our collective attention to the problem of continued racial injustice in America,” Brennan tweeted. “He did so not to disrespect our flag but to give meaning to the words of the preamble of our Constitution—‘in order to form a more perfect union.’ Well done, Colin, well done.”

"The body of a newborn was found abandoned and with toilet paper in its mouth inside the bathroom of an AirAsia India flight that landed in Delhi on Wednesday, authorities said.

Authorities believe the baby was born during the flight and are investigating if the baby was stillborn, NDTV reported.

Police told the news station the baby's mother was detained after all women aboard the flight were questioned. Agence France Presse reported the mother was 19 years old.

“She has only told us that she is a sportsperson but refused medical examination or [to give] any more details about the incident,” police official Sanjay Bhatia told AFP.

The airline said the newborn was found lifeless by staff as they prepared for landing.

""A doctor from the medical team at Delhi International Airport confirmed that the baby had been delivered onboard,” the airline said.

"No matter when John McCain left this earth, he would have been praised to the skies by the journalists who admired him enormously, even though they liked him far better when he was taking on his own party.

But because he died in the Trump era, there is in many of the media tributes an implicit or explicit contrast being drawn with the president who most of these same journalists decidedly do not admire.

And President Trump has fueled that story line by balking at saying anything positive about the 81-year-old senator after his death on Saturday—even, according to The Washington Post, nixing a plan by John Kelly, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and other staffers to have the White House put out a statement praising McCain as a hero.

And in final words read by his former campaign chief Rick Davis, McCain appeared to take a subtle shot by saying we shouldn't confuse patriotism with ""tribal rivalries"" and ""weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down.""

Trump, after a fierce backlash, again lowered the White House flag to half-staff yesterday with a statement that ""despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain's service to our country.""

I'll leave it to readers and viewers to decide which of these two tough-talking adversaries they prefer. But there is simply no question that in giving the onetime Vietnam POW a hero's sendoff, many journalists and commentators are delivering an implicit rebuke of Trump.

It's a case study in the disparity between the way the media treat politicians they like, personally and ideologically, and those they dislike. McCain, who once jokingly called the press ""my base,"" provided enormous access and was the most frequent Sunday show guest ever. Trump says 80 percent of the media is fake news and frequently attacks journalists and their outlets, though he does provide more access than is commonly realized because he doesn't hold formal press conferences.

None of that should matter when it comes to coverage, but it does.

Post columnist David Ignatius, while acknowledging the late senator’s flaws, begins a piece this way:

""John McCain's death offers a moment to think about the insurgency in the GOP that vexed him during his final decade as a politician, and that produced in Donald Trump a man he seemed to loathe, but couldn't figure out how to stop.""

Ignatius, a ""Morning Joe"" fixture, goes on to say he believes McCain was among those who could never imagine that enough Americans ""would actually vote for someone of such low moral character. McCain's refusal to temporize about Trump, as other Republicans have, was one of his finest moments.""



So it becomes a litmus test: If, like McCain, you are a person of moral character, then you must stand up to Trump.

New York Times columnist David Leonhardt warily embraces ""McCainism,"" but first feels obliged to tell readers about the conservative lawmaker’s bad side:

""I'm well aware that McCain could be maddeningly inconsistent and flawed. He equivocated about the Confederate flag in 2000. He too often acquiesced to Mitch McConnell's torching of Senate norms. For goodness sake, McCain decided Sarah Palin should be vice president. As he himself admitted, he should have done much more to fight Republican extremism.""

And yet, the piece says, ""the sum total of his career still represents a meaningful alternative to Trump, McConnell and the rest of today's Republican leadership.""

And so, like so much else in today's society, everyone must be judged by where he or she stands on Trump or his policies. The acrimony between the two men makes that an easier story line, but it's not the only story line.

John McCain was shot down over Hanoi in 1967. He was first elected to Congress in 1982. He had an entire career, an entire life, before Trump took office last year.

To judge this wounded warrior through the lens of Trumpism is unfair, and suggests to me that too many in the media feel compelled to make everything about this president.",politics
"The defense for Paul Manafort rested their case Tuesday without calling the ex-Trump campaign chairman to the stand to testify in the bank and tax fraud case against him.

Addressing the court for the first time during his trial, Manafort stood up and told Judge T.S. Ellis III that he did not want to testify.

After two weeks of testimony from prosecution witnesses, until now it had been unclear whether the defense would put forward witnesses or evidence of their own. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team rested their case Monday afternoon.

“We believe the government has failed to meet their burden of proof and we’ve rested on that,” Manafort defense attorney Kevin Downing told reporters outside court.

The trial now heads to closing arguments, set to begin Wednesday morning. Ellis told both sides to limit those arguments to one and a half hours each.

PROSECUTION RESTS CASE IN MANAFORT CASE

Manafort, 69, is facing tax evasion and bank fraud charges after being accused of hiding income earned from his Ukrainian work from the IRS. He’s also accused of fraudulently obtaining millions in bank loans.

Manafort has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Ellis on Tuesday also ruled against the defense’s motion to acquit. The trial was delayed for two hours Tuesday after the morning proceedings began under seal and were closed to the public and press.

Before the trial adjourned for the day, the court took part in what’s called a charging conference - where the judge and lawyers from both sides discussed what the judge would tell the jury before deliberations.

Ellis, who has not shied from making colorful comments during the trial, signaled that he will tell the jury to disregard any comments he made during witness testimony that might have shown his opinion.

“Do you think I made any comments,” Ellis asked both sides.

After a short silence, prosecutor Greg Andres stood and said, “Yes.” There was audible laughter in the courtroom.

Last week, the prosecution’s star witness, Rick Gates – Manafort’s former business partner who struck a plea deal to cooperate with the government -- testified that he and Manafort committed bank and tax fraud together.

On Monday, James Brennan, the vice president of The Federal Savings Bank, testified under immunity about a loan the bank gave Manafort. According to Brennan, the bank approved $16 million in loans to Manafort by CEO Stephen Calk, who was angling for a cabinet position in the Trump administration.

When asked by prosecutor Greg Andres if he thought the loan should have been approved, Brennan replied, “My recommendation was the loan not be made.”

Brennan said the loan was approved because of Calk. He said the Federal Savings Bank ended up losing $11.8 million on the loan.

The prosecution had been expected to rest on Friday. But Ellis mysteriously delayed testimony in the case for five hours on Friday. The postponement was significant, as prosecutors had been hoping to finish calling witnesses Friday -- and Ellis has a reputation as a stickler for keeping trials moving.

Manafort’s legal troubles won’t end with this trial. He is also facing charges in a separate federal court case in Washington, including conspiring against the United States, conspiring to launder money, failing to register as an agent of a foreign principal and providing false statements.

"The White House is reportedly seeking a briefing on the information that lawmakers received Thursday regarding classified documents related to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s attorneys, told the Associated Press on Friday that the White House hopes to receive a handout of the information next week, specifically in relation to a government informant who reportedly approached members of the Trump campaign in a possible attempt to gather intelligence on Russia’s efforts to influence the election.

Giuliani said that if the alleged spying turns out to have been “inappropriate,” then “we may have an entirely illegitimate investigation,” referring to the Mueller probe.

""(W)e may have an entirely illegitimate investigation.” - Rudy Giuliani, attorney for President Donald Trump

He then invoked the material compiled by former FBI Director James Comey before he was fired.

""Coupled with Comey's illegally leaked memos, this means the whole thing was a mistake and should never have happened,"" Giuliani said. ""We'd urge the Justice Department to re-evaluate, to acknowledge they made a mistake. It's a waste of $20 million of the taxpayers' money. The whole thing is already a waste of money.""

"" ... (T)he whole thing was a mistake and should never have happened. ... It's a waste of $20 million of the taxpayers' money. The whole thing is already a waste of money."" - Rudy Giuliani, attorney for President Donald Trump

President Donald Trump’s legal team may take what they learn to the Justice Department in hopes of stymieing the ongoing special counsel probe.

Trump has dubbed the reported informant digging around during his presidential campaign as a “spy,” and said “it could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!”

The president has also made unproven claims of FBI misconduct and political bias.

Comey has stood by his decision to share details from one of his memos with a friend in hopes of getting it to the news media, and contends he has done nothing wrong.

If Giuliani files any complaints, they would presumably fall on the desk of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller last year following Comey’s ousting. Rosenstein was also present for Thursday's briefings.

The FBI and Justice Department on Thursday held a pair of high-level briefings for lawmakers in an effort to ease Republican pressure over the Russia investigation, amid Trump’s outcry over revelations that a confidential informant made contact with several of his advisers during the 2016 campaign.

""What motivated putting him in? What sort of information were they seeking from him? What did they get?"" Giuliani asked Friday. ""They clearly did not get incriminating information or we'd have found out about it by now. And why did they hide it for so long? There's a big concealment that went on here for over a year since the president said he had been surveilled.""

""What did they get? They clearly did not get incriminating information or we'd have found out about it by now."" - Rudy Giuliani, attorney for President Donald Trump

So far, 19 people, including Trump's former campaign chairman and former national security adviser, have been charged in Mueller's investigation. Three former Trump aides have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the investigation.

Following the meetings -- which were initially offered to Republicans, but expanded to include an afternoon session for bipartisan members of Congress -- Democrats claimed they saw no evidence to believe that the FBI acted inappropriately.

U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was not in the meetings but, in a radio interview Friday, broke with the president to say a ""confidential informant is not a spy,"" though he cautioned about investigations into campaigns.

The presence of a White House lawyer, Emmet Flood, and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, alarmed Democrats at the briefing over concerns the officials would share information from the meetings for Trump’s legal advantage. But Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said both left “as planned before the substantive portion of the meeting began,” and ""were there to relay the president's desire for as much openness as possible under the law.”

Giuliani said it would be appropriate for Trump to be briefed on the findings.

""He's not the subject or target of that investigation. He should know what is discussed,"" said Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and a former federal prosecutor. ""Moreover, I assume President Obama knew about it. And if Obama knew about it, why can't Trump?""

""(I)f Obama knew about it, why can't Trump?"" - Rudy Giuliani, attorney for President Donald Trump

Giuliani also said the president would wait to decide on whether to sit down for an interview with Mueller until after they have seen a report on the briefings.

The White House has yet to provide any evidence to support Trump’s claim that President Barack Obama's administration was trying to spy on his 2016 campaign for political reasons – and it remained unclear whether any spying took place.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., an ardent Trump supporter, originally demanded the information on an FBI source in the Russia investigation.

Late Sunday, the DOJ asked its watchdog to investigate whether there was inappropriate surveillance.

""If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action,"" Rosenstein said in a statement announcing the move.

"Candidates expressing strong support for President Trump continued their winning streak in Republican primaries Tuesday, capturing nominations in Florida, Arizona and Oklahoma. The victories confirm the strong approval ratings the president gets from Republicans across the nation.

In Florida, Republican voters nominated U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis to be their candidate for governor. DeSantis, a three-term congressman from the Jacksonville area, won a decisive victory over state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.

DeSantis was the underdog in the race until President Trump enthusiastically endorsed his candidacy and became a vigorous supporter. The president’s backing propelled DeSantis, who earned a Bronze Star in the Navy, to an impressive 57 percent to 37 percent victory over Putnam.

DeSantis has earned a reputation as an innovative conservative reformer in Congress and is well-positioned to take on Andrew Gillum, the far-left Tallahassee mayor and Democratic nominee who is backed by democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Also in Florida, two-term Republican Gov. Rick Scott – another strong supporter of President Trump – easily won the GOP primary to become the party’s U.S. Senate candidate against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Scott currently leads Nelson by a margin of 46 percent to 44 percent, according to an average of recent polls.

Nelson, who has enormous name identification as the incumbent, is in a precarious position with such low support in the polls. Growing numbers of voters are seeing him for what he is – an out-of-touch career politician who has held elected office for most of the past 46 years.

Gov. Scott has pledged to help enact President Trump’s “America First” agenda if voters send him to the Senate. This represents a stark contrast to Nelson, who has essentially become little more than an obstructionist, following the lead of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

The run-off election in Oklahoma provided clarity for the fall elections in the Sooner State. Republicans chose political newcomer and businessman Kevin Stitt over former longtime Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett as their candidate for governor.

GOP voters also selected first-time conservative candidate and Trump supporter Matt Pinnell as their candidate for lieutenant governor over state Corporation Commission Chair Dana Murphy. Republicans have a considerable advantage in conservative Oklahoma, a state President Trump carried by a whopping 36 points in 2016.

In Arizona, two-term U.S. Rep. Martha McSally won a primary battle convincingly over former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. McSally, a decorated retired Air Force colonel, will now square off against liberal Democratic U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.

In the general election campaign, Sinema will have to explain to Arizona voters why she sided with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California in opposing President Trump’s historic tax cut. The tax cut has paved the way for robust economic growth, millions of new jobs and extraordinarily low unemployment rates – including the lowest Hispanic unemployment numbers ever recorded.

Also in Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey secured a resounding primary victory after a welcome endorsement push from President Trump.

Senate Races Around the Country

Following Tuesday’s primaries, the stage is finally set in all the critical races around the country that will decide control of the U.S. Senate in the midterm elections.

In West Virginia, Trump-backed state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey will take on two-faced Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Manchin talks up the Trump agenda on one end of Pennsylvania Avenue and then votes against it when he’s with his pal Chuck Schumer on Capitol Hill.

Morrisey will make the case that the Hillary Clinton-supporting Manchin clearly no longer represents the interests of West Virginia, a state whose citizens adore President Trump and rewarded him accordingly with an astonishing 42-point margin of victory in 2016.

Republican Trump-backed candidates are faring extremely well across the country in states the president won in 2016.

In North Dakota, a state President Trump carried by 36 points, polling indicates that Republican challenger U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer is running ahead of incumbent Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.

Similarly in Montana, where Trump cruised to a 21-point victory in 2016, Republican state Insurance Commissioner Matt Rosendale is leading liberal Democratic Sen. Jon Tester according to a recent poll.

Another hotly contested Senate race in the Midwest is in Missouri, where polls indicate conservative Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley is running neck and neck with Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, another liberal career politician. President Trump is planning another trip to Missouri next month, a state he carried by 19 points in 2016.

And finally, in Indiana conservative outsider Mike Braun is running a very strong race to take the seat of Sen. Joe Donnelly, the incumbent Democrat. President Trump will be returning to Indiana this week – another state he carried by a commanding 19 points in 2016.

It’s clear that the Democrats in the Senate facing re-election in Trump Country are going to have plenty of sleepless nights between now and Election Day.

Will voters choose the Trump-powered Republican agenda of low taxes and less red tape, economic growth, border security and a strong military?

Or will voters choose the Schumer-Pelosi Democratic agenda of tax hikes, open borders and a meritless partisan impeachment witch hunt that will only be a waste of time and money?

The American people will study the issues and the candidates and make their decision. It’s a big one.",politics
"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was criticized by women’s rights groups after he allegedly made a joke linking the high rape crime rate in the southern city of Davao to the number of “beautiful women” living there.

Duterte made the quip while delivering a speech Thursday in Davao, the city where he was once mayor, Al Jazeera reported.

“They said there are many rape cases in Davao,” he said. “As long as there are many beautiful women, there will be more rape cases.”

PHILIPPINE PRESIDENT RODRIGO DUTERTE UNDER FIRE AFTER CALLING GOD ‘STUPID’

The president’s comments were immediately criticized by women’s rights activists and groups.

""Duterte seems to hate women so much that he comes up with statements that help normalize rape,"" Elizabeth Angsioco, a women’s rights activist, told Al Jazeera. ""This is unacceptable. Not from anyone, especially not from the highest official of the land.”

“Instead of seriously addressing the problem, the misogynist Duterte has added insult to the scars of rape survivors,” women’s rights group #BabaeAko (I Am Woman) said in a statement.

Gabriela, a Philippines women’s rights network, released a statement regarding Duterte’s comments.

""Yet again, President Duterte sends a very dangerous and distorted message in his latest rape remark, that a woman's beauty is a cause of rape,"" the statement read.

PHILIPPINES’ DUTERTE VOWS TO RESIGN IF ANYBODY CAN PROVE GOD EXISTS

""He toys with Davao pride and misogyny to gloss over a very important detail that women in his hometown of Davao City suffered the most number of rape cases in the country. This latest theatric only confirms one thing: President Duterte is proud to have rolled back whatever gains and legal mechanisms that have been instituted for women's rights in Davao City,” the statement concluded.

Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, released a statement regarding the president’s comments, saying people should not “give too much weight on what the president says by way of a joke.”

“They’re not O.K. with rape jokes but let’s just say that perhaps the standard of what is offensive and what is not offensive is more liberal in the south,” Roque told The New York Times.

This is not the first time Duterte has come under criticism for his comments about women before. He called his daughter a “drama queen” when she revealed she was a victim of sexual assault. In February, he bragged that he ordered troops to shoot female communist fighters in their vaginas, according to multiple reports.",world
"The 25-year-old soccer coach who led his youth team into a Thai cave complex where the group was stuck for more than two weeks is a former Buddhist monk who's cheated death at least once before.

Ekapol Chantawong, affectionately known as “Ake,” was trapped with the team of 12 boys — ranging 11 to 16 years of age — in northern Thailand’s Tham Luang Nang Non cave since June 23, when they went exploring after a practice game. The team was stuck without food for more than a week until rescuers discovered them alive.

Following a three-day harrowing rescue mission, all of the boys and the coach were rescued from the cave by July 10.

Ekapol had already cheated death; when he was just 10 years old, his parents and brother were killed by a disease that ravaged his village, only sparing him, The Australian reported.

He lived with extended family members for a short time after his family’s deaths, but he was “sad and lonely” so he was sent to a Buddhist temple for training to be a monk, his aunt, Umporn Sriwichai, told The Australian.

He spent 10 years at the temple and still occasionally visits to meditate, family members said. It’s that training that could have helped him keep the team alive as they remained trapped in the cave.

“He could meditate up to an hour,” Tham Chanthawong, another aunt, told The Associated Press. “It’s definitely helped him and probably helps the boys to stay calm.”

THAILAND CAVE RESCUE IS LIKE ‘CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST,’ FORMER NAVY SEAL SAYS

Police had said they were going to look into potential charges against Ekapol, but parents have credited the coach with keeping their children safe in the cave.

The Wild Boors senior coach said Ekapol “loves the boys more than he loves himself.”

Last week, the team was able to write letters to their loved ones, and Ekapol apologized to families of the children in his care.

“I promise I will care for the kids as best as possible. I want to say thanks for all the support and I want to apologize to the parents,” he wrote.

“Coach Ake is very dedicated to the team,” said Noppadon Kanthawong, whose 13-year-old son plays on the Wild Boars but decided to skip the cave trip. “He would be there at the field waiting for kids to show up after school. It is a great way to keep healthy, away from screens and have friends. I can tell that they are very close to each other.”

“When he comes out, we have to heal his heart,” Pornchai Kamluang, mother of one of the trapped boys, said, adding, “I would never blame [the coach].""

A LOOK AT SOME OF THE RESCUE OPTIONS FOR THAI SOCCER TEAM TRAPPED IN CAVE

A close friend of some of the players praised Ekapol as the “real hero” throughout the ordeal.

“I love Ake, he’s the one I trust, he’s the one who takes care of all the kids,” friend Auttaporn Khamheng told local media. “To survive, they are all heroes, but the biggest hero is the coach. I’m sure he has done everything for all the kids in the cave.”

“When he comes out, we have to heal his heart. I would never blame you.” - Pornchai Kamluang, mother of one of the trapped boys.

Ekapol had recently been given more responsibility with the team. He was the one with the team on June 23 because head coach Nopparat Kathawong reportedly had an appointment.

The members of the Wild Boars are a team on and off the soccer field, traveling to competitions, cycling mountain roads and swimming in waterfalls together.

Officials said it wasn't the first time some of the soccer players had been inside the cave.

""The kids have been in the cave before, but they didn't think that going in at this time would be that dangerous,"" Chote Narin, an officer at Mae Sai district police station, told The Associated Press.

Coach Ekapol's Facebook page is packed with photos and video of him and what appear to be members of his team practicing, cycling the area's mountain roads and inner tubing on a river.

THAI SOCCER TEAM PENS LETTERS TO FAMILIES

A post from December 2016 reads, “Special training before the competition. Tham Luang Nang Non.” Attached are 10 photos from inside the cave of boys in soccer uniforms smiling and posing for photos, lit by the beam of a flashlight.

The conditions of those rescued Tuesday, including that of the coach, have not been revealed.

"Maybe it's John Bolton clutching a gun. Maybe it's Mike Pompeo setting down his binoculars to stare into the distance. Maybe it's the gators.

But a newly unveiled painting meant to depict President Trump and his team navigating the Washington ""swamp"" has something for everyone.

Utah-based artist Jon McNaughton touched off a social media frenzy as he shared his painting, “Crossing the Swamp,” Tuesday on Twitter. The painting is a riff on the classic “Washington Crossing the Delaware,” only it replaces George Washington's crew with members of the Trump administration.

“My new painting—‘Crossing the Swamp’ ‘Never give up. Never lower your light. Never stop till the swamp is dry,’” McNaughton tweeted.

The painting shows Trump at the helm, and Vice President Pence carrying the flag by his side.

McNaughton identifies the rest as: U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley; Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson; Attorney General Jeff Sessions; first lady Melania Trump; Secretary of State Pompeo; White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders; the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump; National Security Adviser Bolton; Kellyanne Conway; and Chief of Staff John Kelly.

McNaughton is a Trump supporter, hashtagging “MAGA” on his Twitter bio.

“Trump endeavors to cross the ‘swamp’ of Washington DC as he carries the light of truth, hope, and prosperity. The murky water of the deep state is laced with dangerous vermin, perfectly willing to destroy American prosperity for their personal ideologies and financial gain,” McNaughton said of his latest painting on his website.

McNaughton also wrote that he hopes people will “study the paintings and try to understand the deeper meaning.”

No matter how earnest the artist's intentions, the painting quickly became Twitter fodder as users seized on a variety of quirky aspects.

Observations included:

""Ben Carson appears to be rowing backwards.""

""They are literally rowing in a circle.""

""Pretty sure Pruitt took the cruise line route.""

""Looks like Jr. didn’t make the boat.""

Twitter can be cruel.

McNaughton has several other paintings on his website about the Trump administration. One, titled “Make America Safe,” depicts Trump standing in front of a white picket fence with an open lock, holding a key, and the American flag waving in the background.

Another, titled “Respect the Flag,” shows Trump on a football field, hugging a ripped flag, seemingly referencing the president’s battle with the National Football League over players kneeling during the National Anthem.",politics
"California state Democrats are distancing themselves from the state party’s chief after he called for the boycott of a beloved burger chain after it donated cash to the state’s Republican Party.

The political feud began last week when Eric Bauman, head of the California Democratic Party, called for the boycott of California-based In-N-Out over its $25,000 donation to the GOP.

Bauman’s call soon became a headache for the party as it captured national headlines and gave ammunition to the GOP as the Democratic leader threatened to alienate the loyal customers of a wildly popular restaurant chain.

But the state Democratic Party quickly backtracked, saying Bauman’s call for a boycott was merely his “personal view” and wasn’t being considered by the state Democratic Party as a policy.

“We’re not happy that In-N-Out gave the money, but we’re not calling for an official boycott,” John Vigna, the party’s communications director, told the Los Angeles Times. “Democrats are very fired up. Chair [Bauman] is definitely giving voice to a feeling a lot of people have right now.”

""We’re not happy that In-N-Out gave the money, but we’re not calling for an official boycott."" - John Vigna, the state Democratic Party communications director

Ordinary voters, too, seemed to be against a boycott.

“Eating at In-N-Out is such a standard thing to do across California,” Anthony Grigore told the Times, dismissing the idea of a boycott as rather silly.

“The stomach overrules the mind,” Jaime Regalado, emeritus professor of political science at Cal State L.A., told the newspaper. “A cheap, good-tasting burger is hard to dismiss politically.”

But despite the damage control, Republicans seized on the opportunity to have a political feast, posting images and declarations of support for the chain.

“Enjoying our favorite fast food restaurant, In-N-Out Burger, at the Capitol today. No boycott here!” Republican state Sen. Jim Nielsen wrote on Facebook, attaching a photo of himself surrounded by multiple orders of burgers and fries.

Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox posted on Twitter a photo of himself in front an In-N-Out as well, saying “There’s nothing more Californian than In-N-Out Burger.”

Matt Fleming, a spokesman for the California Republican Party, also weighed in on the issue.

“It’s disappointing that he’s attacking a company that’s a California institution and widely regarded as a good employer,” he wrote in a tweet.

Meanwhile, In-N-Out released a statement addressing the donations to the Republican Party, claiming that the chain has made “equal contributions to both Democratic and Republican” PACs in California this year.

“For years, In-N-Out Burger has supported lawmakers who, regardless of political affiliation, promote policies that strengthen California and allow us to continue operating with the values of providing strong pay and great benefits for our associates,” Executive Vice President Arnie Wensinger said.",politics
"Two police officers were among the four people shot and killed Friday morning in the Canadian city of Fredericton, New Brunswick, police said.

The suspect taken into custody has been identified as Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48. He was charged with four counts of first-degree murder at an arraignment Saturday morning, the Globe and Mail reported. Raymond was hospitalized with gunshot wounds after a confrontation with police, authorities said.

The suspect is due to appear in court Aug. 27, the report said.

The slain officers were identified as Sara Mae Helen Burns, 43, and Lawrence Robert Costello, 45, officials said during a news conference.

Burns had been on the force for two years before previously serving as an auxiliary officer for another two years, police said. She leaves behind a husband and three children.

Costello was a 20-year veteran of the police department and leaves behind a partner and four children, police said.

On Saturday, authorities identified the two slain civilians as Donald Robichaud, 42, and Bobbie Lee Wright, 32. A Facebook post by Wright earlier this month said the pair were in a romantic relationship, the Globe and Mail reported.

Fredericton police responded to calls of shots fired around 7:10 a.m., Deputy Police Chief Martin Gaudet said. After arriving to the scene, officers saw two civilian victims on the ground before getting shot themselves.

Earlier Friday morning officials tweeted to caution residents to avoid Brookside Drive due to an ""ongoing incident."" Later, police confirmed four people had been killed. It was not immediately clear what caused the shooting.

Police urged residents to stay in their homes and lock their doors at the time of the incident.

Residents told CBC News the gunshots sounded like popping noises.

""With the tempo, it might've been a gunshot. It was sort of like a pop, pop, pop, pop,"" resident Robert Didiodato told CBC News.

Didiodato said people were staying inside their homes and following the department's instructions.

CTV News spoke to a woman who was escorted from her residence in the area and she told the station she heard what appeared to be gunshots. The media outlet reported police were talking to residents in the area asking what they heard or witnessed.

David MacCoubrey, who lives in Fredericton, said he heard about 20 shots and was hiding on his kitchen floor.

""I'm on my floor,"" he told the Associated Press in a phone interview. ""The cops have come through my place. They have searched all the apartments in the building. It sounded like it started in the courtyard area.""

MacCoubrey said police have been searching the buildings, and he’s been sitting away from windows.

Travis Hrubeniuk said his fiancée had just left for work around 7:45 a.m. local time when he began hearing a steady stream of sirens.

Hrubeniuk said residents have been advised to stay inside with their doors locked. The quiet residential neighborhood, which has houses, grocery stores, a church and an elementary school, is the last place Hrubeniuk said he expected to encounter a dangerous situation.

""This is the first time I've even heard of any serious crime or violent crime in this city,"" he said.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted his condolences following the incident.

""Awful news coming out of Fredericton. My heart goes out to everyone affected by this morning's shooting. We're following the situation closely,"" the prime minister wrote.

Fredericton has a population of about 58,000 and is located just northeast of Maine. The city is the capital of New Brunswick.

"Finding someone in Washington who is nonpartisan and puts the nation’s interests ahead of their own is so rare these days that he or she, if found, might well qualify as an endangered species.

But once in a while — call it the law of averages — someone speaks the truth. It happened last week when Mark Penn, former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton, wrote a column for The Hill newspaper in which he claimed there is a big difference between how Hillary Clinton and President Trump have been treated when it comes to allegations of criminal behavior.

Penn then appeared on Fox News where he spoke of the “double standard” applied to Trump and his associates compared to how Clinton was exonerated by FBI Director James Comey over her private email server and her handling of classified information. “The investigations related to the email were handled with kid gloves, and the investigations related to Trump ... with all-out prosecutorial force of government and deep state might,” Penn said.

It doesn’t matter. The long knives have been drawn by those who want to reverse the results of the 2016 election and put themselves back in power. They will not be sheathed until blood is drawn, preferably the blood of the president, whose personality might not win him any good deportment citations on a grade school report card, but whose policies are making the nation stronger.

President Trump needs to refocus and stop attacking his political enemies, and even his friends, and start worrying about his most pressing problem.

Neither does it matter that no evidence of Russian “collusion” by the Trump campaign has yet to be uncovered. That train seems to have long ago left the station, replaced by other strategies to bring down the president, none of which were part of the special counsel’s original mandate.

Indeed, on July 13 when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictment of 12 Russians for their alleged roles in hacking computers at the Democratic National Committee and other sites, he said: “There’s no allegation in this document that any American citizen committed a crime. There’s no allegation that the conspiracy changed the vote count or affected any election result.”

Rosenstein knows the indicted Russians will never be extradited and tried, so it looks to most conservatives like a public relations stunt designed to show that Robert Mueller was pursuing what he had been tasked with discovering.

Having failed to achieve that objective, the tentacles of his office have spread out in other directions, now reaching the Trump organization where its CEO has been granted full federal immunity and will likely be required to divulge anything — perhaps even those long-hidden Trump income tax returns, which Democrats have wanted made public since the 2016 campaign.

President Trump needs to refocus and stop attacking his political enemies, and even his friends, and start worrying about his most pressing problem. As The Wall Street Journal editorialized, “The biggest political threat to Mr. Trump is a Democratic election victory in November, which will trigger a drive for impeachment. Mr. Trump isn’t going to persuade anyone to vote for Republicans by railing against a Republican attorney general he selected.”

He should stop publicly admonishing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who early on recused himself from all things Russian. After the president’s latest criticism of Sessions, Sessions issued a statement defending the law and the integrity of the Department of Justice against the president’s constant criticism.

Yes, the DOJ has behaved differently under Sessions (and Rosenstein) than it did when Eric Holder, described as President Obama’s “wing man,” held that post, but nothing can be done about that now. The president should concern himself with what is being done on other fronts where he can credibly claim success. The problem is that his constant attacks on others, which achieve little, have obscured many of his accomplishments.

Americans want to be happy about the present and optimistic about the future. This president — any president — should see that as his main calling and pull back on his Twitter barrages. There should be only one standard for a president’s behavior.",politics
"South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Monday that President Trump deserves to win a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in talks to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and end the decades-long war between the North and South.

Moon’s comment, as reported by Reuters, came following a congratulatory message from Lee Hee-ho, the widow of late South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, where she said Moon deserved to win the prize for his work with North Korea. Moon’s response was that Trump, instead, should win the prize.

“President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize,” Moon reportedly told a meeting of senior secretaries, according to a Korean official who briefed the media. “What we need is only peace.”

The comments came just days after Moon met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un for a summit at the Peace House in Panmunjom.

Trump continued to play an active role on Monday, floating the possibility of holding his expected summit with Kim at the same location.

""Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!"" he tweeted.

TRUMP TOUTS ‘HISTORIC’ KOREAN SUMMIT: ‘KOREAN WAR TO END’

The Korean leaders announced Friday they would work to achieve a “nuclear-free Korean Peninsula,” and also expressed hope to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War by the end of the year, though it is not clear at this point.

Trump called the summit between the two leaders a “historic meeting,” and touted the outcome, noting that the people of the United States “should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea.”

The leaders also agreed that beginning May 1, all loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts that have been blaring from each side of the heavily-armed borer will be suspended. They also agreed to dismantle broadcasting equipment and stop flying propaganda leaflets across their border.

Kim also promised Moon that he “won’t interrupt” his “early morning sleep anymore,” referring to missile tests, South Korea said.

During the summit, the Korean leaders announced that they will jointly push for talks with the United States, and potentially China to officially end the war. The Koreas also agreed to stop all hostile acts over “land, sea and air” that cause military clashes and tensions.

The date for Trump's expected summit with Kim is not yet scheduled. Last week, Trump slammed media reports that he was making concessions to secure the meeting with the North Korean dictator as inaccurate. Newly confirmed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to North Korea earlier this month to lay the foundation for the meeting between Trump and Kim.

Last week, Trump criticized the Obama administration for allowing the situation in North Korea to escalate, while calling former Secretary of State John Kerry the “worst negotiator” he’d “ever seen.”

Earlier this year, Moon applauded Trump, noting he “deserves big credit for bringing about the inter-Korean talks,” and said “it could be a resulting work of the U.S.-led sanctions and pressure.”

Trump has put what his administration describes as “the heaviest sanctions ever imposed on a country before” on North Korea, crippling the DPRK’s economy. Under the sanctions, the Treasury Department aimed to cut off sources of revenue and fuel used to boost the country’s nuclear program and military.

“Treasury is aggressively targeting all illicit avenues used by North Korea to evade sanctions, including taking decisive action to block the vessels, shipping companies, and entities across the globe that work on North Korea’s behalf,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement in late February.

U.S. officials, at that time, said the sanctions were also aimed at hindering the regime’s ability to transport coal and fuel in international waters, in an effort to further isolate the rogue regime and advance the U.S. pressure campaign.

"Omarosa Manigault Newman raked in $179,700 a year at the White House – the top salary for a presidential aide, on the same level as chief of staff, press secretary and national security adviser.

But Manigault Newman’s new book – where she trashes President Trump, accusing him of being racist and mentally unstable – raises questions about what exactly she did at work every day as director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison.

The book, “Unhinged,” is heavy on score-settling and rehashing of personal feuds but devotes far less text to the specific issues and policy areas she was hired to work on. And those she claims to have worked closely with are suggesting she exaggerated her role in the book.

“I didn't really interact with her that much,” former White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday on Fox News' “America’s Newsroom.” “She came and she would sit in meetings from time to time. It wasn't like we were close by any means.”

But in the book, Manigault Newman claimed to have spent a large portion of her day with Spicer.

Describing a typical day at the White House, she claimed she huddled in Spicer’s office at 7:30 a.m.; joined Spicer and other senior staff for a meeting in the chief of staff’s office at 8 a.m.; went back to Spicer’s office to prep for his daily press briefings at 11 a.m.; attended Spicer’s daily briefing at 1 p.m; and returned to Spicer’s office for a “wrap up” meeting at 6 p.m.

But Trump tweeted this week that Manigault Newman, who had her own assistant in the White House, was a poor employee who was often absent.

“I would rarely see her but heard really bad things,” he said. “Nasty to people & would constantly miss meetings & work.”

In the book, she described how Chief of Staff John Kelly called her out, before firing her, for using the official White House car service to get to the Washington Nationals stadium for the annual Congressional Baseball Game.

Kelly, she said, accused her of abusing the service. But she argued it was appropriate because she was at the game, along with other aides, on “official business.”

“I didn't really interact with her that much"" - Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer

According to the White House, the Office of Public Liaison is “the primary line of communication between the White House and the public.”

She described her job largely as being in close proximity to the president during public events, also writing that she spent her day “running all over the complex, from one meeting to another, all day long and deep into the evening.”

“Throughout the first one hundred days, whenever the president had a listening session in the Roosevelt Room, I was always standing nearby,” Manigault Newman wrote. “When he signed an [executive order] that related to diversity, women, veterans, any [Office of Public Liaison] group – from truckers to college presidents – I was in the Oval or other locations with him.”

She also boasted of talking with the president “three to four times a week.”

“Whenever I took point on an event – for example, going to the Smithsonian during Black History Month—I briefed him at least twice before each one,” she said.

Manigault Newman also wrote she was tasked with reaching out to the black community on the White House’s behalf. She spent her time “working as hard and as fast as I could,” she claimed, saying “my schedule during Black History Month alone exhausts me just writing about it.”

But she most often got attention in the news for missteps, like when she committed a faux pas in dealing with the Congressional Black Caucus in 2017.

The CBC posted a screenshot of her letter to them at the time where the aide referred to herself as “The Honorable Omarosa Manigault Newman” – an honorific usually reserved for elected officials like the president and lawmakers or appointed officials like federal judges or Cabinet members.

She wrote that part of her job was talking to reporters, to give them background information or context about administration policies. But some journalists still say they never fully understood what her role was.

Infamously, the Daily Beast spent a day with Manigault Newman at the White House, reporting that there was “confusion about Omarosa’s precise role” in the administration and that she spent the work day planning her bridal luncheon.

“Sarah Sanders repeats the claim that the press wouldn't give Omarosa the time of day when she was on good terms with Trump,” tweeted Robert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics. “That's not true. The press spent much of Omarosa's time in the White House trying to figure out WHAT HER JOB WAS.”",politics
"Journalism got a lot smaller last week. The media lost two of their biggest names – author and journalist Tom Wolfe and Interview Magazine.

Wolfe, who wrote “The Right Stuff,” spent decades making people appear larger than life. Interview, founded by pop culture icon Andy Warhol, used its larger-than-normal format to make its subjects grow in stature.

The industry is diminished, left with its war against President Trump as journalists battle over whether an informant sent to spy on the Trump campaign is actually a “spy.”

That is part of their larger anti-Trump crusade, but it’s also tied to how negatively the press is viewed generally.

Tesla CEO and tech wunderkind Elon Musk provided a huge example of the anger at the media, tweeting: “Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda.”

Notice how the idea of one political party using the FBI to spy on another isn’t the constitutional crisis in the eyes of the media.

Reporters skewered Musk. The Washington Post called out his “meltdown” and Politico dubbed him “a Media Assassin.”

Verge Senior Transportation Reporter Andrew J. Hawkins used journalism’s ultimate criticism, saying Musk “continues his slow transformation into a media-baiting Trump figure screaming irrationally about fake news.”

But 88 percent of those who voted in Musk’s Twitter poll supported his Yelp for news media.

The press still has a large number of opportunities to defend itself. The new documentary series “The Fourth Estate” on Showtime chronicles 16 months at The New York Times.

By the tone of the trailer, the series is a wonky version of a WWE smackdown – The Gray Lady vs. The Donald. Sadly, even the paper’s own reviewer called it “reasonably competent, but it’s also superficial and oblivious a little more often than one might like.”

There’s a metaphor in there somewhere. Or just save yourself time and watch this hilarious Seth Meyers skit about “The Post” called “Newspaper Movie” that makes fun of the term “the fourth estate.”

Journalists get no respect, especially from the president. They were furious over “60 Minutes” Correspondent Lesley Stahl’s claim that President Trump deliberately tries to “discredit” and “demean” the press “so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you.”

President Trump’s purported comment was attacked all across media – broadcast networks, cable, top newspapers and left-wing outlets. MSNBC host and former NBC anchor Brian Williams was clearly worried about the comment’s impact on the Mueller investigation.

Williams asked, “are they likely to react to a remark like that?” And this is a man who knows all about how to “demean” and “discredit” his profession.

CNN’s Senior Media Correspondent Brian Stelter was equally concerned, saying people should feel “insulted” by President Trump’s action. Stelter then attacked the president’s alleged assault on the press … by attacking the press, specifically “60 Minutes.”

So the media solution to fan complaints that the NFL doesn’t respect our nation is … for the NFL to not respect our nation. Gotcha.

Stelter’s “cynical” theory was that “60 Minutes” delayed the story because it “thought Trump would agree to an interview last fall. I think now it’s 18 months, they’ve given up.” He left out that such a long time raises big questions about the agenda behind Stahl’s timing.

The media overreaction to this “revelation” is typical. Journalists act surprised when politicians on the right criticize the press, though they do it all the time. Because the press is biased against them.

Even funnier was the part of the interview that didn’t get much attention. Stahl noted that “Democrats think that reporters are on their side” and “expect reporters to be kind to them and gentle.” Kudos to Stahl for at least admitting that “they assume we’re liberals and we’re going to be on their side.” Now try finding the media addressing that part of her interview.

2. Depends on What the Definition of ‘Spy’ Is: The media are in an uproar because President Trump called the “informant” investigating his campaign a “spy.” The Times led with this classically parsed headline: “F.B.I. Used Informant to Investigate Russia Ties to Campaign, Not to Spy, as Trump Claims.”

The Times didn’t name him, stating it “typically does not name informants to preserve their safety.” That was May 18. Four days later, Professor Stefan Halper was a headline in The Washington Post as the informant.

“Spygate” was suddenly the news and journalists even resented that. The Associated Press reported that President Trump used the term to “raise suspicions about the probe that has dogged his presidency since the start.”

The press grew obsessed with the “S” word, even though former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitted “they were spying” on Russians and their potential ties to the Trump campaign. CNN warned of President Trump’s “paranoia.”

The president’s call for an investigation prompted NBC White House Correspondent Kristen Welker to ask : “Is the president threatening the longstanding independence of the Justice Department?”

NBC’s “Meet the Press” Moderator Chuck Todd termed it a “constitutional crisis” and wondered: “Are the president's systemic attacks on the Justice Department undermining the rule of law as we know it?”

Notice how the idea of one political party using the FBI to spy on another isn’t the constitutional crisis in the eyes of the media.

MSNBC guest and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Harry Litman said President Trump’s criticisms were akin to the Nazi bombing of London during The Blitz. “Look, the Justice Department is under a shelling from the White House. It’s like London 1941 there,” he argued.

Even the AP Fact Check of President Trump’s comments on the investigation wasn’t able to handle reality. AP objected to Trump’s factual statement that “The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia.”

The Fact Check argued that “there has been no definitive resolution as to whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia in the 2016 election.” Somehow AP didn’t grasp that, until proven otherwise, Trump is correct to say that there is “no collusion.”

3. NFL Takes a Stand on Kneeling: The NFL is still trying to figure out the right play to defeat President Trump on the issue of players kneeling during the national anthem. The league is now saying it will levy fines on teams if players kneel, but it will also allow players to stay in locker rooms to avoid the anthem entirely.

The media were naturally opposed to the new rule. SB Nation called it “a laughably terrible idea.” USA Today Sports’ Dave Birkett said showing respect for the anthem “smells of a military state.”

New York Times National Security and Legal Reporter Charlie Savage argued that the “long-term solution to this is just to depoliticize the games entirely.”

So the media solution to fan complaints that the NFL doesn’t respect our nation is … for the NFL to not respect our nation. Gotcha.

MSNBC went out of its way to push the anti-kneeling agenda. “Hardball” host Chris Matthews turned to ex-NFL wide receiver Donte Stallworth. He’s a former 9-11 truther and served all of 30 days for killing a man while driving drunk. Great guy to support a protest of the national anthem.

Stallworth called it the “height of hypocrisy” for people to not support the protest, perhaps forgetting that his critics also have free speech rights.

Law & Crime Network Host Amy Dash even claimed that “this is all feeding Kaep's (Colin Kaepernick’s) attorneys with golden evidence of an improper influence by the WH on NFL and its owners to support collusion case.” Because presidents never use the bully pulpit to express their feelings on news.

Of course, many in the media also predictably freaked out when President Trump said of the protesting players: “Maybe they shouldn’t be in the country.”

Stephen Espinoza, the president of Showtime Sports, responded: “That doesn’t sound dictatorial at all.”

They still don’t grasp that he’s trolling them.",politics

"Seattle lawmakers, after being pressured by business leaders to repeal a controversial tax meant to address the city's homeless problem, have a brand new plan -- turn City Hall's lobby into a homeless shelter.

The Seattle City Council voted unanimously Monday to approve a plan expanding the number of housing and shelter units by 25 percent. That includes an extra 100 spaces at City Hall.



""When people have access to shelter, they’re more likely to take advantage of services like behavioral health, hygiene services, and employment support, and then move to permanent housing,” Mayor Jenny Durkan said in a statement. “We all have to contribute to solutions to this crisis, which is why we’re opening City Hall [to] more people each night.""

KOMO News reports that the homeless will be housed in the lobby, with the shelter being run by the Salvation Army. That is in addition to an overnight shelter in the building that has the capacity for 60 people to stay. The outlet reported that the plan would cost $13 million.



Seattle’s lawmakers are still struggling to grapple with the homeless problem. In a press release announcing the move, Durkan’s office said that while Seattle currently has 2,032 shelter spaces, they are more than 90 percent full each night.



The move comes shortly after the Council voted this month to repeal a “head tax” that it controversially passed only a month before.

That tax would have taxed businesses making at least $20 million in gross revenues about $275 per full-time worker each year. The estimated $48 million that would have brought in was earmarked for housing and homeless shelters.



That proposal drew significant criticism from Amazon and Starbucks, with Amazon releasing a statement saying the tax would cause it to reconsider future growth in the city.



“The city does not have a revenue problem – it has a spending efficiency problem,” Drew Herdener, Amazon vice president, said in a statement. “We are highly uncertain whether the city council’s anti-business positions or its spending inefficiency will change for the better.”

The Associated Press reports that the Seattle region had the third-highest number of homeless people in the U.S., despite the city spending $68 million on combating homelessness last year.",politics
"President Trump suggested Monday that China could be “exerting negative pressure” on North Korea to stray from the denuclearization “deal” signed last month, amid trade tensions between the U.S. and Beijing.

The president expressed confidence that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un will “honor” the informal deal, despite tense talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over the weekend.

“I have confidence that Kim Jong Un will honor the contract we signed &, even more importantly, our handshake. We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea,” Trump tweeted. “China, on the other hand, may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade—Hope Not!”

The president’s tweet comes days after the administration increased tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports as Beijing said it would be “forced to make a necessary counterattack.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping instructed various levels of government to get ready for a full-on trade war, The Wall Street Journal reported last week, citing Chinese officials.

China is expected to hit back against the Trump administration’s 25 percent tax on those Chinese goods with taxes on an equal amount of American products, including soybeans, lobsters, sport-utility vehicles, and whiskey. But according to the Journal, China has not yet outlined exact targets.

But the president’s confidence in North Korea comes after the rogue regime over the weekend accused the U.S. of undermining the spirit of last month’s summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore, calling talks with Pompeo “regrettable.”

“We had expected that the U.S. side would offer constructive measures that would help build trust based on the spirit of the leader’s summit…we were also thinking about providing reciprocal measures,” Pyongyang’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement to the Associated Press. “However, the attitude and stance the United States showed in the first high-level meeting (between the countries) was no doubt regrettable.”

North Korea then accused the U.S. of making “gangster-like” demands regarding denuclearization.

Pompeo, though, reaffirmed the U.S. goal of complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and said that his talks with the rogue regime were conducted in “good faith.”

“If those requests were ‘gangster-like,’” Pompeo said during a press conference in Tokyo, “then the world is a gangster because there was a unanimous decision at the U.N. Security Council about what needs to be achieved.”

Pompeo said that sanctions will remain in place against North Korea and be enforced with “great vigor.”

“I am determined to achieve the commitment that President Trump made,” Pompeo said. “I’m counting on Chairman Kim to be determined to follow through on the commitment that he made.”

"The House passed a resolution Wednesday expressing support for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, as a growing number of liberals in the Democratic Party has called to abolish the agency that enforces federal immigration laws.

The non-binding resolution, sponsored by Louisiana GOP Rep. Clay Higgins, passed 244 to 35 with 133 voting present -- and Republicans may “weaponize” the vote against Democrats. The measure extols ICE for countering the narcotics trade and applauds its efforts in rescuing people caught in human-trafficking schemes.

“I am grateful to the members of Congress who today publicly declared their support for the brave, dedicated men and women of ICE,” Acting ICE Director Ron Vitiello said in a statement after the vote. “We will continue to fulfill our sworn oaths to enforce federal immigration and customs laws.""

Senate Republicans tried to follow in the House’s footsteps and approve via unanimous consent a resolution supporting ICE. But it was blocked by Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris on the floor.

Republicans likely will deploy the House roll call vote against Democrats who didn’t vote the measure in the midterms this November, analysts have said. Democrats, ahead of the vote, dismissed it as a partisan maneuver.

“It is a meaningless stunt,” New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said before the vote. Nadler said he voted present because “we have more important things to do.”

“This is exactly the kind of 'gotcha vote' which alienates Americans from their government... Democrats refuse to play the Republicans' game,” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said. “We’re not falling for this trap.”

House Republicans initially had planned to hold a vote on a bill authored by Wisconsin Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan to abolish ICE, but opted instead to call a vote on the Higgins resolution. They painted Democrats as outside the mainstream on the issue.

'ABOLISH ICE' GOES MAINSTREAM IN DEMOCRATIC PARTY

“House Democrats once worked collaboratively with Republicans to improve the effectiveness of federal immigration enforcement,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said. “Now, it appears that they are outraged when ICE has the audacity to actually enforce the laws that we have enacted.”

President Trump has embraced ICE as a campaign issue.

“The Democrats want to abolish ICE, which will mean more crime in our country,” Trump tweeted Monday. “I want to give ICE a big cheer! Vote Republican in November.”

The idea to abolish ICE was once relegated to the far-left. But the liberal push to abolish ICE is increasingly being embraced by officeholders in Democratic Party, including New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The growing influence behind the push was underscored last month with liberal primary challenger Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's shocking victory over Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., a member of party leadership. Ocasio-Cortez emphasized her support for abolishing ICE during the campaign.",politics
"Seattle’s anti-Trump mayor, Jenny Durkan, may be on track for a political backlash: Her city’s $52 million money splash on public transit appears doomed because new taxpayer-funded streetcars apparently won’t fit the existing tracks.

Durkan’s office has braced city residents for the possibility, the Seattle Times reported.

The Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) reportedly ordered 10 new streetcars last year, to help expand the Seattle Streetcar system by linking the two existing streetcar lines.

But the new streetcars also are reportedly heavier and longer than the ones currently in use, raising concerns about whether they'll be used at all.

“It appears the error will require either a change order for design of the streetcars or incur new costs for construction of new or retrofitted maintenance barns,” City Councilmember Lisa Herbold wrote in the city’s blog post last week.

“It appears the error will require either a change order for design of the streetcars or incur new costs for construction of new or retrofitted maintenance barns.” - Seattle City Councilmember Lisa Herbold

Durkan had to temporarily stop work on the project after revelations that it may cost 50 percent more than previously estimated, the Times reported. The estimated total cost has already increased from $150 million to $200 million.

It's just the latest of several setbacks for Durkan while her national profile continues to rise amid fervent attacks against the Trump administration over immigration, climate change and abortion.

In April, after the U.S. Justice Department sent letters urging so-called sanctuary cities, including Seattle, to prove they are cooperating with federal immigration authorities, Durkan fired back, saying the administration should focus on “real public safety threats.”

“Our city complies with federal immigration law and asks that the Department of Justice and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] do the same,” Durkan said in a statement. “The federal government does not get to run our cities or convert our local law enforcement officials into immigration cops. I implore this administration to focus on real public safety threats, like the opioid crisis, instead of unnecessarily threatening our residents and mayors across the country.”

Durkan doesn’t hold back when attacking the administration on Twitter, either.

“As woman mayors, we are doing our part to protect our citizens against the all-out war that the Trump administration has waged against safe, inclusive communities, clean energy, and bold climate action,” she wrote in a tweet.

“Further evidence that Trump’s administration is founded on cruelty and callous disregard for immigrant lives. Seattle stands with Salvadorans against this unjust decision,” she wrote in another tweet, referring to the Trump administration’s decision to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from El Salvador.

But as the mayor’s profile rises nationally, the city is facing dire problems and embarrassing flip-flops. The Seattle region reportedly has the third-highest number of homeless people in the U.S., even though the city spent $68 million on combatting homelessness last year.

Earlier this year, the city council also had to repeal a “head tax” aimed at taxing businesses that make $20 million in gross revenue about $275 per full-time worker each year.

The money would have gone to alleviate the homelessness problem. The tax was repealed just a month later after it passed due to pressure from Seattle-based companies Amazon and Starbucks.",politics
"Florida Gov. Rick Scott released a financial disclosure report Friday that revealed for the first time he is reportedly worth at least $255 million.

Scott, who is running against Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, turned in a 125-page, federally required financial disclosure to the U.S. Senate.

The report shows that his family is much richer than the Republican governor has been reporting to state authorities.

While the Senate report does not require exact amounts, it lists that at least $170 million in assets are held by Florida first lady Ann Scott. The disclosure was the first time that Scott has disclosed his wife’s investments, the Miami Herald reported.

The 65-year-old multi-millionaire businessman is the richest person to ever serve as the state’s governor, according to the Herald.

The financial report also shows that the Scott family has holdings in a vast array of companies as well as a substantial portfolio of bonds from local governments and other public institutions.

The holdings could raise questions about conflicts since both Scott and his wife have invested in companies that do business in Florida, including a subsidiary of the company that owns Florida's largest electric utility.

Scott has routinely insisted he has no control over his investments since his own personal holdings are in a blind trust that is not managed by him. His campaign repeated that assertion after the report was released.

""The blind trust is managed by an independent financial professional who decides what assets are bought, sold or changed,"" Scott's campaign said in a statement. ""The rules of the blind trust prevent any specific assets or the value of those assets within the trust from being disclosed to the governor, and those requirements have always been followed.""

But the report is sure to give fresh ammunition to critics of Scott, who maintain he has been hiding details of his fortune.

""It is clear financial shenanigans have allowed Rick Scott to obscure his true finances for eight years,"" said Don Hinkle, a Tallahassee attorney who has sued Scott. Hinkle, a one-time fundraiser for former President Barack Obama, contends Scott is violating state financial disclosure requirements.

The Democratic Party and Nelson's campaign did not immediately respond for comment.

During his first run in 2010, Scott released his tax returns and a lengthy list of business holdings.

Scott has used his wealth to help bankroll his campaigns during his three runs for office.

Shortly after he first took office, he received permission from the ethics commission to set up a blind trust to remove direct control over his finances in an effort to avoid possible conflicts. But the trust is managed by a company that includes a longtime business associate of Scott.

""Gov. Scott's blind trust setup doesn't pass the smell test,"" Zach Learner, campaign manager for gubernatorial candidate Chris King, told the Tampa Bay Times. ""Floridians deserve a governor who complies with the spirit of what a blind trust is meant to do.

Scott, who does not accept a salary and uses a family jet to travel, first built his fortune as the head of the hospital giant Columbia/HCA.

He was forced out of the job amid a federal investigation into fraud. Although Scott was never charged with any wrongdoing, the company paid a then-record $1.7 billion fine for Medicare fraud.

"President Trump said on Sunday that he would be willing to shut down the federal government if the Democrats do not agree to Republican demands about funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump wrote on Twitter that border security ""includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery, Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!""

The White House has been embroiled in controversy over the ongoing efforts to reunite families separated at the border who were attempting to enter the United States illegally.

During his most recent weekly address, Trump cited the 9/11 terrorist attacks to justify strong enforcement of immigration laws and the continued necessity of Immigration Customs & Enforcement, the agency which has come under fire from Democrats in recent months.

“One of the critical lessons of 9/11 is that immigration enforcement saves lives,” he said in the address. “We must enforce the rules against visa fraud, illegal overstay, illegal entry and other immigration violations and crimes, and crimes they are. Believe me, crimes they are.”

A recent House bill would devote $5 billion to a southern border wall, but its passage in the Senate, where it would need the support of Democrats to reach the required 60-vote threshold, remains a longshot.

PORTLAND TO CLEAN UP 'DISGUSTING' OCCUPY ICE CAMP

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who is the majority whip, told the Washington Examiner that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was once ready to offer $25 billion in border security funding in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers.

However, Schumer has since withdrawn that offer, which at the time was rejected by Republicans and President Trump, who wanted additional immigration reforms.

Democratic lawmakers and candidates, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon, have called for the abolishment of ICE.

In April, Trump threatened to shut down the government during a rally in Michigan, stating that more money was needed to fund the border wall.

“We come up again on September 28th and if we don’t get border security we will have no choice, we will close down the country because we need border security,” he said, according to Reuters.

During an interview on iHeart Radio Friday, Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said border wall funding will probably have to wait until after the midterms.

The federal government shut down briefly for three days in January after lawmakers could not agree on funding for immigration reform, border security and disaster relief.

Trump, who made security and building a border wall a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign, also said that Mexico would pay for the new wall.",politics
"The administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Monday said the agency had a ""systemic problem going on for years"" after its former personnel chief was accused of facilitating sexual harassment in the workplace.

Brock Long, who's led FEMA since June 2017, told The Washington Post that a seven-month-long internal investigation found that Corey Coleman, who oversaw the personnel department from 2011 until he resigned in June, operated a ""toxic"" environment within the agency. A summary of the investigation was released Monday; it did not name Coleman but FEMA officials told The Associated Press the report referred to him.

TAXPAYER PIGGY BANK LETS CONGRESS SETTLE SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES IN SECRET

Coleman, the former deputy personnel chief of the U.S. Secret Service, reportedly hired his friends and romantic interests, and promoted them ""without going through proper federal hiring channels"" despite their lack of qualifications.

The former chief allegedly shuffled women across departments so that his friends could have sexual relationships with them, employees and a FEMA official told the newspaper.

The Post reported it could not reach Coleman for comment.

""What we uncovered was a systemic problem going back years,"" Long said, adding that ""the biggest problem I may solve here may be the eradication of this cancer.""

He continued, ""How many complaints were not heard? I've got to make sure we have a safe working environment for our employees."" Long noted he's referred several cases to the inspector general of Homeland Security to investigate what could be criminal sexual assault.

Agency officials said the inspector general's office had received complaints about Coleman previously -- Long said the alleged misconduct dated back to 2015 -- but the complaints were forwarded back to FEMA to investigate.

Many of the friends or others whom Coleman hired remain at FEMA, according to the report. Long said many human resources department employees left the agency because of Coleman's ""unacceptable leadership style.""

In addition to hiring his friends, Coleman also allegedly had sexual encounters with two subordinates who accompanied him on work trips.

LES MOONVES, TOP CBS EXEC, ACCUSED OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IN BOMBSHELL REPORT

One of the women, after she rejected a relationship with Coleman, reportedly was denied a promotion at the agency and attempts to fire her were subsequently made. The woman reportedly told Coleman she might be willing to see him again, and she was able to keep her job.

The second woman with whom Coleman allegedly had a relationship told investigators he created a job within the agency for her and admitted she was unqualified, the newspaper reported.

House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., and Ranking Member Elijah Cummings, D-Md., responded: ""We are outraged and appalled by the revelations in today's FEMA report."" They continued, ""Following the conclusion of the investigation, our Committee plans to hold a hearing to fully examine the results and to determine what role Congress can play in assuring this never happens again.""

Coleman reportedly was transferred to other FEMA offices during his tenure at the agency because, according to Long, the morale within his department was ""so bad.""

"A Mercedes-Benz and multiple Range Rovers. A $3 million brownstone in Brooklyn, bought with cash. More than $1 million worth of clothes purchased at elite boutiques on both coasts, and an almost $940,000 tab over two years at an antique rug store in Alexandria, Va.

Those lavish expenditures are now evidence in the high-stakes bank and tax fraud trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, which is set to begin with jury selection Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.

The trial is the first arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. It represents a major test not just for Manafort, who faces decades in prison on bank and tax fraud charges if convicted, but also for Mueller, whose ongoing probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election could lose credibility if jurors ultimately acquit Manafort.

President Trump repeatedly has called the Mueller probe a ""witch hunt,"" and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has suggested the investigation is ""rigged.""

Neither the Virginia trial nor Manafort's separate upcoming trial in Washington, D.C., directly relates to any alleged collusion between Trump officials and the Russian government, or purported Russian disinformation campaigns -- a fact that led to a tense courtroom showdown just months ago.

The judge in the case, T.S. Ellis III, harshly rebuked members of Mueller's team in a preliminary hearing in May, saying they were pursuing the case against the 69-year-old ex-Trump adviser only as a means to target the president.

""You don't really care about Mr. Manafort,"" Ellis told prosecutors. ""You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever.""

Prosecutor Greg Andres flatly told the judge: ""I don’t anticipate that a government witness will utter the word 'Russia.'""

WATCH: DERSHOWITZ SAYS MUELLER HOPING MANAFORT WILL TESTIFY AGAINST TRUMP RATHER THAN 'DIE IN PRISON'

But Ellis ultimately allowed the case to proceed, saying the prosecution fell within Mueller's broad authority to investigate Russian involvement in U.S. politics.

The trial, which is expected to last about three weeks, centers on accusations that Manafort intentionally hid millions of dollars he earned from the Ukrainian government and oligarchs to lobby on behalf of since-deposed pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych.

Little is known yet about the defense's strategy. But prosecutors say they will show that Manafort failed to report a ""significant percentage"" of the nearly $60 million in income from his Ukraine work on his tax returns, and did not properly indicate that he maintained bank accounts in foreign countries.

They also alleged that Manafort committed bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy in several instances. In one case, prosecutors claimed, Manafort falsely told Rhode Island-based Citizens Bank on a loan application that a condominium he used as security for a $3.4 million loan was not being used as a rental property.

In another instance, Mueller's team alleged, Manafort and former Trump aide Rick Gates lied to Chicago-based Federal Savings Bank by providing false profit and loss statements to obtain nearly $16 million in loans.

Gates, Manafort's former business partner, pleaded guilty earlier this year in the probe and cut a deal with prosecutors. He is one of 35 witnesses that the Mueller team said it may call during the trial, alongside ex-Manafort aide Alex Trusko and ex-chief Bernie Sanders strategist Tad Devine, who also did work for Yanukovych.

Other witnesses Mueller has signaled may testify include those with information about Manafort's allegedly lavish spending habits: an employee at a car dealership where Manafort's wife bought a high-end Mercedes, a New York Yankees season ticket salesperson, and an employee at a clothing boutique where Manafort reportedly splurged on suits worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Five potential witnesses were offered and granted immunity in the case, including former Manafort accountants.

WHO ARE THE 35 WITNESSES MUELLER IS PLANNING TO CALL IN THE HIGH-STAKES MANAFORT TRIAL?

Although prosecutors have agreed not to bring up any alleged Russian collusion or meddling in the trial, they are expected to argue that Manfort's campaign work is inextricably linked to some of his alleged crimes, according to court filings.

In one instance, prosecutors claimed, a senior unnamed banking executive ""interceded"" to approve an allegedly deficient multimillion-dollar loan application by Manafort, because that executive was seeking a role in the Trump administration. The executive never assumed a position in the White House.

""You don't really care about Mr. Manafort."" - U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III, to Mueller prosecutors

""[I]t would be difficult for the jury to understand why the loans were approved without understanding that the lender approved the loans, in spite of the identified deficiencies, because the senior executive factored in his own personal ambition,"" prosecutors wrote in a filing.

Separate court filings have suggested prosecutors could argue that Manafort sought to conceal some of his Russia-linked spending to avoid political damage during Trump's run for president, as a way to establish motive for some of his alleged deceptions.

In addition to Manafort and Gates, two other former Trump associates have been charged in the Mueller probe: ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn and aide George Papadopoulos – though none of the charges are directly related to any misconduct by the president's campaign.

Alex van der Zwaan, an attorney, pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators during the investigation, and was sentenced to 30 days in prison in April 2018. He was the first to be sentenced in the probe.

Manafort has been held in solitary confinement for alleged witness tampering by the judge in his pending D.C. trial, Judge Amy Berman Jackson. Manafort's attorneys have said his confinement has been unnecessary and unduly harsh, and has impeded his ability to communicate with his defense team.

Observers have questioned whether President Trump will pardon Manafort if he is convicted. Trump has said he feels ""badly"" about Manafort's situation, and that he considers it unfair that he has been ensnared by Mueller's probe.

"Chicago activists are demanding that Mayor Rahm Emanuel resign as they prepare for a major anti-violence protest against the city's spiraling crime crisis.

Organizers of the march reportedly are gearing up for a potentially chaotic demonstration on Thursday, timed with the start of Lollapalooza and before a Cubs game. Organizers did not rule out trying to enter Wrigley Field and predicted at least some protesters would be arrested.

Meanwhile, they are making clear they don't want the Democratic mayor's support or blessing -- as they are calling on him to resign over of his inability to get the city’s gun crime under control.

“The call of the people is ‘Resign Rahm,’” Dr. Gregory Livingston said, according to The Chicago Tribune. “So how, then, can you back your own regime change? How do you sanction your own termination? How dumb, naive and self-hating do you think we are?”



“Honestly, when the mayor endorses a protest, it’s no longer a protest,” Rev. Ira Acree said. “It becomes a parade, and we’re on serious business.”

NBC Chicago reported that the protesters said they are looking to “redistribute the pain and agony of no economic development on the South and West Sides to the North side.”



The protest will head from Lake Shore Drive toward Wrigley Field.

ANTI-TRUMP LONDON MAYOR KHAN UNDER FIRE FOR CRIME PROBLEM

“We have people who are committed, who are ready to get arrested,” Acree said, according to the Tribune. “And those who don’t, they’ll stay back. But certainly, people are going to get arrested.”

The march comes after thousands of protesters shut down traffic on Interstate 94 earlier this month to draw attention to gun violence. Chicago police said the city had 252 homicides and 1,100 shootings in the first six months of 2018, a decrease from last year -- but the crimes have been concentrated in predominantly black, low-income neighborhoods.

While Emanuel is in the crosshairs of this week’s protest, he had offered support to the protest earlier this month -- even scolding Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner after he called on Emanuel to “put an end to this kind of chaos.”

“It was a peaceful protest. Delete your account,” Emanuel responded.

"Democrats launched an 11th-hour bid Tuesday to stall a Trump administration settlement allowing a company to share blueprints for 3D-printed guns online, issuing dire warnings that the president will have ""blood"" on his hands if he doesn't intervene.

Curiously, some of the most heated statements came after President Trump tweeted about his reservations over the 3D-gun decision.

""I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!"" he tweeted Tuesday morning.

But it's unclear whether the president is planning to seek any further changes.

""The president is committed to the safety and security of all Americans and considers this his highest responsibility,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters aboard Air Force One late Tuesday. ""In the United States, it is currently illegal to own or make a wholly, plastic gun of any kind -- including those made on a 3D printer. The administration supports this nearly two-decade old law.

""We will continue to look at all options available to us to do what is necessary to protect Americans while also supporting the First and Second amendments,"" Gidley added.

The Trump administration in June had settled a lawsuit from a Texas-based company, allowing the company to resume posting the blueprints after it had been stopped from doing so under the Obama administration in 2013. The company’s website has said downloads will be allowed Wednesday, though blueprints have been posted since Friday.

On Monday, eight states filed suit against the administration, while attorneys general in 21 states urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to pull back from the settlement.

Congressional Democrats kept the pressure up Tuesday with a series of fiery statements to the media.

""Donald Trump will be totally responsible for every downloadable, plastic AR-15 that will be roaming the streets of our country if he does not act today,” Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said at a press conference.

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said if Trump fails to act, ""blood is going to be on his hands.""

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., went a step further and said the settlement was “a death warrant for countless innocent men, women and children.”

3D-PRINTED GUN BLUEPRINTS CAN BE DOWNLOADED, ENDING LENGTHY LEGAL BATTLE

“The Trump Administration’s sickening NRA giveaway undermines the very foundations of public safety. Metal detectors and other security measures will be completely useless against the flood of undetectable and untraceable ‘ghost guns’ that the GOP is inviting into our schools, workplaces, airports and public buildings,” she said in a statement.

While the blueprints can be printed using a 3D printer, industry experts told The Associated Press that such printers are expensive, the guns can disintegrate quickly, and normal guns are easier to access.

Still, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., introduced legislation to block the online publication of such blueprints.

“These 3D-printed plastic firearms can evade our detection systems and are a direct threat to our national security,” Nelson said at a press conference Tuesday to announce the bill. “And we are going to let these go up on the internet tonight at midnight?”

While the Trump administration agreed to the settlement, Trump indicated Tuesday that he had spoken to the National Rifle Association (NRA) about his concerns.

His tweet drew the ire of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who asked: “What kind of incompetence and dangerous governing is this?”

NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch argued that the backlash has erupted merely because of Trump administration involvement.

“People have been making guns at home for personal use for ages, plastic (not undetectable, still uses metal) or not. People are acting like this is a new thing because MUH TRUMP, apparently,” she said.

Late Tuesday, NRA Executive Director Chris Cox said: “Many anti-gun politicians and members of the media have wrongly claimed that 3-D printing technology will allow for the production and widespread proliferation of undetectable plastic firearms.

""Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years,"" Cox added. ""Federal law passed in 1988, crafted with the NRA's support, makes it unlawful to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer, or receive an undetectable firearm.""

The company behind the settlement, Defense Distributed, has defended the move as a First Amendment issue, not a gun rights issue. Founder Cody Wilson told The Washington Post that the controversy is about access to information.

"The high-stakes trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort kicked off Tuesday at a federal courthouse in northern Virginia, refocusing the special counsel probe for at least the next several weeks on the veteran operative’s alleged tax evasion and eye-popping spending habits – but not Russia’s 2016 election meddling.

Proceedings began Tuesday in Alexandria with jury selection. Manafort, who arrived early in the morning in a grey van with tinted windows, wore a suit and was seated with his lawyers.

Judge T.S. Ellis III instructed the pool of roughly 75 potential jurors that “nothing is more important than jury duty as an American.”

The trial is the first arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

"President Trump blasted the conservative mega-donor Koch brothers on Tuesday as a “total joke” and promised supporters he would be “a puppet for no one,” amid rising tensions over trade and other administration policies.

“The globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade. I never sought their support because I don’t need their money or bad ideas. They love my Tax & Regulation Cuts, Judicial picks & more,” Trump tweeted.

“I made them richer. Their network is highly overrated, I have beaten them at every turn. They want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from being taxed, I’m for America First & American Worker -- a puppet for no one. Two nice guys with bad ideas. Make America Great Again!”

The president’s tweets come after the advocacy network created by billionaires Charles and David Koch announced they would not support Republican Senate candidate for North Dakota, Kevin Cramer. The Koch brothers also did not endorse Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

A spokesman for the Koch Network responded to the president's criticisms later Monday morning.

""We support policies that help all people improve their lives,"" spokesman for the Koch Network James Davis said in a statement to Fox News. ""We look forward to working with anyone to do so.""

The Washington Post reported that at a reception held by the Koch network over the weekend, officials revealed a new approach —distancing themselves from the GOP and becoming less focused on partisan politics.

Charles Koch said he “regrets” support for some Republican lawmakers in recent years.

“We’re going to be more strict on holding someone accountable if they say they’re going to be for the principles that we espouse, and then they aren’t,” Charles Koch said, according to the Washington Post. “Our organization is happy to support anybody. We’d love for there to be more Democrats to support these ideas and these issues.”

The Koch brothers have been highly critical of Republicans in recent months, slamming the GOP for not doing enough to curb government spending in their $1.3 trillion spending bill adopted in March.

"President Trump on Tuesday voiced concern about 3D-printed guns being available to the public, saying he has talked to the National Rifle Association and it “doesn’t seem to make much sense.”

""I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!"" he tweeted.



On Monday, eight states filed suit against the administration over its decision to allow Defense Distributed to publish downloadable blueprints for guns online. The suit argues that the weapons assist terrorists and criminals, and essentially nullify state gun control laws.

Separately, Democratic attorneys general in 21 states urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to pull back from the settlement.

3D-PRINTED GUN BLUEPRINTS CAN BE DOWNLOADED, ENDING LENGTHY LEGAL BATTLE



The founder of the Texas-based company first published designs for a 3D-printed gun in 2013, which was subsequently printed approximately 100,000 times until he was ordered to stop by the State Department. The June settlement allows the company to resume posting the blueprints.



The company meanwhile, filed its own suit on Sunday, claiming it is the victim of an ""ideologically-fueled program of intimidation and harassment"" that violates the company's First Amendment rights.



Founder Cody Wilson told The Washington Post that the controversy is not about gun regulation and safety risks: “It’s about access to information.”



According to the Post, the Trump administration rejected the First Amendment argument as early as April, noting that the files direct the functioning of a 3D printer and cause it to create firearms. But the settlement nevertheless allows the blueprints to be circulated.



The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence slammed the move as “reckless and stupid.”



“During the Obama years, the government thought that 3D printed guns posed a serious threat to national security. I'm not aware of anything that has changed except who sits in the White House,” Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told Fox News in an emailed statement last month.

“Untraceable and undetectable guns that bypass our bipartisan background check system put us all at risk. The country deserves answers from the Trump Administration about why it thinks this is a good idea. Making it easier for dangerous people to get guns is reckless and stupid, and this is going to make Americans less safe.""

Meanwhile, a State Department spokesperson said Tuesday that the department has ""completed the actions that were required under the settlement agreement in the Defense Distributed litigation.""

Trump’s tweet appears to complicate the matter somewhat, but Democrats didn’t seem appreciative of the support.



“Your administration approved this. What kind of incompetence and dangerous governing is this?” responded Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “And to check with the NRA? Holy moly.”

"The co-founder of a movement calling for California to secede from America -- after giving away nearly half the state to form an ""autonomous Native American nation"" -- suggested Wednesday that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren might not be welcome in the proposed new territory.

Speaking on Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" ""Calexit"" organizer Marcus Ruiz Evans said the issue ultimately would be up to the ""brown-skinned"" inhabitants of the California spinoff state.

""Elizabeth Warren would not be able to come in there, unless the Native people of the area say she's welcome,"" Evans said. ""If they didn't do that, it doesn't matter what she says; she wouldn't be allowed in.""

Warren has long been accused of falsely saying she is of Native American heritage to help in securing jobs, including one as a Harvard law professor. President Trump has repeatedly called Warren, a Wall Street critic and potential White House rival, “Pocahontas,” to highlight the controversy.

'REAL INDIAN' RUNNING AGAINST SEN. WARREN SUES AFTER CITY DEMANDS HE STOP CALLING HER 'FAKE INDIAN'

Supporters of Trump, Evans said, shouldn't expect a much better reception.

""The primarily Trump voters will have to do what brown-skinned people tell them to do, because brown-skinned people will be in charge,"" Evans told host Tucker Carlson. ""And if they don't like that, they're welcome to leave California.""

Calexit's new plan to give Native Americans all federal lands in the state, running from the border with Mexico to the state boundary shared with Oregon, was announced earlier this week.

Because most of the federal land would include conservative-leaning portions of California, the plan would create a “buffer zone between Donald Trump’s America and the new independent California Republic,” Evans said in a statement Tuesday.

Evans explained to Carlson that while eastern California admittedly isn't the state's prime real estate, giving it away “would at least be a step in the right direction” -- and, he claimed, a better system than existing Native American reservations, which he said remain subject to federal interference.

TRUMP SUGGESTS SLOWLY TOSSING DNA TESTING KIT AT WARREN DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Another Calexit co-founder, Louis Marinelli, told Fox News he is well-aware that many conservatives support California leaving the rest of the country.

“We would love to see official numbers on nationwide support for Calexit,” he said, adding that, “on a constant basis ... people [are] emailing how they want California to secede, or as they put it: break off and fall into the ocean.”

Calexit is distinct from Cal 3, a prominent parallel effort to split California into three states, purportedly to improve its governance.

The California Supreme Court earlier this month blocked the Cal 3 proposal from the November ballot, saying it was too significant a change to the state’s structure to be undertaken by a ballot initiative. Instead, the court ruled, the state’s constitution required action by the legislature.

The move was a setback not just for Cal 3, but also for Calexit, whose organizers say is often confused for Cal 3 and could face similar legal objections.",politics
"President Trump makes so much news that I could write a half-dozen columns today just on his latest comments and tweets—any one of which would lead the news in ordinary times.

Trump says he's willing to meet with the leader of Iran, despite having abandoned the nuclear deal. I'll put that in the category of Not Happening, not least because the Iranians (unlike Kim Jong-un) say they have no interest in sitting down with the president who's squeezing their country with economic sanctions.

Trump says the Koch brothers and their network are a ""total joke"" and ""globalist"" and ""highly overrated."" This is a response to criticism from Charles Koch and some of his donors that the president’s rhetoric is divisive and they don’t back him on tariffs and immigration. But the Kochs were never big Trump fans and didn’t endorse him.

Trump tweeted yesterday that ""the Fake News Media is going CRAZY! They are totally unhinged and in many ways, after witnessing first hand the damage they do to so many innocent and decent people, I enjoy watching."" ""Crazy"" and ""unhinged"" are very strong words, but the president pretty much goes off on the press every day now.

I was not terribly excited when Trump said he would be willing to shut down the government if the Democrats don't give him funding for border security, including the wall. I view this as a negotiating tactic to pressure the other party on a hot-button issue in the midterms. After all, the last government shutdown lasted, what, a few hours?

But it led to a fascinating Wall Street Journal editorial yesterday that questioned whether Trump really cares if Republicans lose the House in November. The brinkmanship, favored by Steve Bannon, might hurt red-state Senate Democrats, but could boomerang in the House, the Journal says.

The editorial argues that the president ""might not fear"" a Democratic House as long as the GOP keeps the Senate: ""Mr. Trump always needs a foil, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi would be from central political casting.""

Sure, a Pelosi-run House ""would mean the end of most of Mr. Trump's agenda."" But he could cut deals with House Democrats on paid family leave, public-works spending and trade protectionism.

And here's the zinger: Even if the House Dems move ahead with impeachment, says the Journal, there would never be a two-thirds Senate majority for conviction. And that could help Trump win reelection if Republicans and independents ""conclude he's the only barrier to a left-wing government led by a President Elizabeth Warren.""

There are plenty of political assumptions baked into this speculation, of course. But the Journal (owned by Rupert Murdoch) is very much running counter to such former Republicans as George Will and Steve Schmidt urging people to vote Democratic this fall to provide a check on a president they despise.

It's true that Bill Clinton thrived (and won reelection) after the Newt Gingrich Republicans captured the House in 1994. And it's true that Trump is at odds with conservative House Republicans on a number of key issues.

But in the end I don't believe that Trump is willing to lose the House in a Machiavellian scheme to propel himself to a second term. House Democrats, even if they're smart enough to avoid impeachment, would make Trump's life miserable with endless hearings, subpoenas and investigations. And they'd play to their base by blocking nearly everything he wants to do.

The president will almost certainly avoid a government shutdown and try to save his House majority, because it would be even harder to win reelection after two years of getting nothing done.",politics
"Two University of Virginia history professors have resigned from the school’s Miller Center for Public Affairs after it hired Marc Short, a former Trump aide.

Professors William I. Hitchcock and Melvyn P. Leffler said the hiring of Short, who was the White House director of legislative and intergovernmental affairs, violated the Miller Center’s values “to hire such a notoriously partisan political appointee as a paid distinguished fellow,” especially without input from faculty.

“Your decision was made without adequate faculty discussion, deliberation, and a vote. The practice of faculty governance did not prevail,” Hitchcock and Leffler said in their resignation letter.

Hitchcock and Leffler will continue to be tenured faculty at the university, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.

The school announced the hiring of Short as a senior fellow earlier this month and was immediately met with opposition.

After the news, 150 UVA faculty and students signed a petition calling for the university to revoke the hiring of Short. An identical Change.org petition has also garnered more than 3,000 signatures as of Tuesday morning.

“While we do not object to dialogue with members of this administration, we do object to the use of our university to clean up their tarnished reputations,” the petition read. “No one should be serving at the highest levels of this administration, daily supporting and defending its actions one week, then representing UVA the next.”

Leffler and Hitchcock were among those who signed the petition.

MARC SHORT’S HIRING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA PROTESTED BY FACULTY, STUDENTS

Faculty and students also criticized Trump’s handling of the aftermath of a white nationalist demonstration in Charlottesville that turned deadly when a man rammed his car through a group of people protesting the white supremacists, killing one woman.

Trump initially blamed the violence “on many sides,” but two days later, he disavowed racists while speaking from the White House. He later returned to blaming “both sides” for the deadly attack, however.

""It is unconscionable that we would add to our university a person who served in a high-level position for the administration that first empowered, then defended, those white nationalists,"" the petition states.

“We are a community still in the process of healing, and someone who defended the president’s remarks after the violence here is a barrier to that process, a source of trauma in a still-traumatized community,” the petition continued.

FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS: A LIST OF NOTABLE DEPARTURES

Short told Politico he is “sympathetic to the pain in the community.”

“I think we could have done a better job expressing sympathy for the victims and outrage at those who perpetrated this evil,” he said.

The two history professors told the Chronicle of Higher Education that they believe Short should be able to speak at the center but objected to his hiring.

A spokesman for the Miller Center said it was “committed to nonpartisan and bipartisan study of the president.”

“The addition of Marc Short, a senior Trump Administration official with intimate knowledge of interactions between the White House and Congress, deepens our scholarly inquiries into the workings of the American presidency,” Howard Witt, director of communications for the Miller Center, previously told Fox News. “And his presence reinforces our commitment to nonpartisan and bipartisan dialogue among scholars and practitioners of good will who may nevertheless hold strongly opposing personal political viewpoints.”

“Moreover, Short can offer insights into the Trump Administration that are not currently available to our scholars or the public at large,” Witt added.

"Vice President Mike Pence spoke at a ceremony Wednesday to mark the arrival of the remains of U.S. servicemen from the Korean War -- and joining him were two guests who lost their fathers in the war.

Pence took to Twitter Wednesday to share that he and his wife Karen would attend the ceremony in Honolulu with Diana Brown Sanfilippo and Rick Downes.

The vice president said that when Sanfilippo was 4 years old she lost her father in the Korean War during a recon mission, and that when Downes was just 3 years old he lost his father operating radar on a B-26 bomber.

Pence later wrote he was “humbled & honored” to be a part of the repatriations ceremony.

North Korea handed over the remains of what U.S. officials said are believed to be the remains of U.S servicemen who fought during the Korean War. A U.S. military plane made a rare trip into North Korea to retrieve 55 cases.

Fox News’ Pete Hegseth, who was traveling with Pence in Air Force Two, recalled the touching stories of the heroes' now-grown children.

“We picked up probably the two most important passengers on that plane: a man and woman who were 4 and 3 years old — little girl and little boy in the 1950s — when they sent their fathers, then young men, both pilots, both first lieutenants, both went to fight in the Korean War,” he said on “Fox & Friends.”

“They dedicated their lives for the last 60 years finding out what happened to their fathers, what happened though those patriots, warriors who went to fight for us, for every generation of Americans,” Hegseth continued.

"His constituents are complaining about the state's crumbling transit system. His own party wants to strip him of gubernatorial powers. The soccer team he owns is living in dire conditions, and one of his sons has been in trouble with the law.

What's a newly elected governor with no experience in elected office to do? He takes a vacation far, far away.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy raised eyebrows last week as he embarked on a swanky 11-day trip to Italy, where he owns a $7 million home he bought during his 23-year stint at Goldman Sachs.

The trip comes just six months after Murphy -- a Democrat and former diplomat under President Barack Obama -- was elected to the top job in the state.

The governor’s office initially declined the reveal where Murphy was going for his holiday, but NJ.com solved the mystery and reported that Italy was the destination. The state’s taxpayers will pick up the tab for protecting the governor while he’s on vacation, with the tab reaching as much as $100,000.

Trouble is, when Murphy returns, New Jersey's problems will still be there waiting for him. Here's a look at some of them.

Broken promises

Despite the governor’s promises in February to ease overcrowding and service issues on New Jersey’s transit system by adding extra rail cars, commuters are complaining that not much progress has been made to actually alleviate the problem.

The plan to add new cars was short-lived. New Jersey leased 10 rail cars from the Maryland Transit Administration to alleviate the overcrowding, but returned them just eight weeks later when the lease ended.

""If my Uber bill this summer is any measure of success, improvement would not be the term I would use."" - New Jersey commuter Niklaus Gunter

“What relief plans? I haven't seen any relief,” one commuter told NJ.com.

“If my Uber bill this summer is any measure of success, improvement would not be the term I would use,” commuter Niklaus Gunter seconded. (Users of NJ Transit often wind up paying for cab or Uber/Lyft rides when their trains and buses fail to show up as scheduled.)

For what it's worth, the NJ Tranist system appears to continue to crumble, with nearly a dozen trains getting canceled on Tuesday morning alone, infuriating commuters. NJ Transit at first offered no explanation, but later vaguely said the installation and testing of a rail safety system called Positive Train Control (PTC) and lack of staff were the reasons for cancellations.

“NJ Transit has taken steps to address these issues by recruiting and training additional locomotive engineers. We anticipate a class graduating within the next couple of weeks that will add nine engineers to the roster,” the statement from NJ Transit reads.

“In addition, we have increased the number of current classes from two to four, running concurrently with staggered graduation dates, to continue the qualification of new engineers,” it added.

Power strip?

The New Jersey governor’s struggles to solve issues may also embolden already existing calls from within his own party to strip him of powers when it comes to deciding how much money various taxes and programs should raise each year, NorthJersey.com reported.

The power to set revenue estimates is crucial as it determines how much the state will need to hike taxes to fund spending priorities. Democrats suggest the role should be shifted to a three-member panel consisting of experts, a move that they say would take politics out of budget calculations and increase transparency.

But Murphy has fought back against the proposal, saying it would upset the balance of power between him and the legislative branch of the state government.

“New Jersey’s Constitution carefully divides the authority in the budgetary process between the Legislature, who has the power to appropriate funds, and the Executive, who has the authority to certify revenues,” Murphy spokesman Dan Bryan said in a statement to the outlet.

“Unlike his predecessor, Governor Murphy is committed to certifying revenues that are realistic, responsible, and sustainable, and feels that it is unwise to disrupt the separation of powers that has existed in this area for over 70 years.”

Soccer team under scrutiny

Closer to home, Murphy is also facing questions about a professional women’s soccer team he co-owns. The club, called Sky Blue FC, faces allegations that it’s mismanaged and provides poor living conditions and subpar facilities to its players.

""Some players were forced to live with an elderly man who repeatedly made inappropriate comments to the players and made them feel uncomfortable."" - The Equalizer report on Murphy's soccer team.

The team's players include U.S. women's World Cup star Carli Lloyd.

The governor bought the team a decade ago as a way to impress his daughter. According to NJTV, he “has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in this losing proposition” just so “his daughter, who plays soccer, could see that women can play soccer at the professional level as well.”

But the club’s training facilities lacked locker rooms or even running water, the Equalizer reported. The players have had to use portable restrooms and have worn dirty gear during practices because there are barely any laundry services.

Another report, published by the soccer news site Once A Metro, detailed the mismanagement of the team and how little interest Murphy actually has taken in it, though it has cost him nearly half a million dollars in recent years.

The report alleges the club failed to provide decent housing for some players, forcing them to sleep on couches, and use sheets of cardboard to cover broken windows. The Equalizer reported as well that “some players were forced to live with an elderly man who repeatedly made inappropriate comments to the players and made them feel uncomfortable.”

Murphy admitted that the conditions weren't acceptable and said the team deserved better treatment. “I don't find the status quo tolerable — and these players deserve better,” he said in a statement, according to NorthJersey.com. “They deserve to operate in a professional and supportive environment so they can do what they do best — play the game, inspire fans, and build community through the power of the world's most popular sport.”

Troublemaker son

But Murphy's rough six-month reign as governor isn’t his only headache. His 20-year-old son, Joshua Murphy, who relentlessly campaigned for him during the 2017 election, had multiple run-ins with the law since Murphy’s rise to prominence.

In June, prosecutors dismissed a complaint concerning the governor’s son, NJ.com reported. He faced charges of underage drinking and disorderly conduct as he allegedly shouted obscenities at a campus police officer on Halloween as he was partying with two young women. According to police, Joshua Murphy ended the night on the ground in handcuffs.

In February, the son drove off a steep slope in Connecticut, the outlet reported, citing police records. His SUV was found by a motorist. According to police reports, Murphy said he crashed the car at early morning and he was unable to contact anyone for help because his phone didn’t work after the crash.

The governor and his wife lashed out against the media for reporting about his son’s endeavors, saying Joshua “has been living a nightmare” thanks to media inquiries.",politics
"Well, that escalated quickly.

The rise of “democratic socialism” has been one of the key developments in the Democratic Party in recent years, first with the popularity of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and more recently Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s primary win over party mainstay Rep. Joe Crowley in New York.



One of the ways the movement is presented is with the claim that this is not your grandfather’s socialism -- or the socialism of the former Soviet Union, Venezuela or other failed states. It’s more “Scandinavian health care” than overthrowing the bourgeoisie.



But now a democratic socialist writer is leveling with voters, telling them that actually, yes, they want to topple capitalism.

""I’m a staff writer at the socialist magazine Jacobin and a member of [the Democratic Socialists of America], and here’s the truth: In the long run, democratic socialists want to end capitalism.



In an article for Vox, Meagan Day, a writer for the socialist magazine Jacobin and a democratic socialist, says the goal is to pursue a “reform agenda today in an effort to revive a politics focused on class hierarchy and inequality in the United States.”



“The eventual goal is to transform the world to promote everyone’s needs rather than to produce massive profits for a small handful of citizens,” she says.

OBAMA SNUBS OCASIO-CORTEZ IN ENDORSEMENT LIST

Day goes on to reject the idea that democratic socialism is just a modern form of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal, as some have suggested.



“But we also want more than FDR did. A robust welfare state in an economy that’s still organized around capitalists’ profits can mitigate the worst inequalities for a while, but it’s at best a temporary truce between bosses and workers — and one that the former will look to scrap as soon as they can,” she argues.



In the meantime, she argues that the goals of democratic socialists should be to go and fight battles that will eventually rally people together to fight what she calls “the capitalist Goliaths currently in charge of our society.”

The article comes after a rough few days for democratic socialists. Ocasio-Cortez was widely criticized for an interview with ""The Daily Show"" where she struggled to lay out exactly how she’d fund her agenda.



A new study found that the “Medicare for All” plan pushed by Sanders, and endorsed by a host of Democratic congressional and presidential hopefuls, would increase government health care spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years.



On Wednesday, former President Barack Obama issued a list of midterm endorsements -- a list which notably did not include Ocasio-Cortez.

"Vice President Mike Pence contended Tuesday that President Trump's administration inherited a ""cyber-crisis"" when he took office, laying the blame for Russian meddling on the Obama administration.

“[S]adly, previous administrations have let the American people down when it came to cyber defense,” Pence said in a speech at the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity Summit in New York City. “At the outset of this administration, it became clear from early on: In a very real sense, we inherited a cyber-crisis.”

Pence suggested the Obama administration was to blame for major security breaches in recent years, such as the Equifax hack -- which affected the data of half the U.S. population -- and the hack at the federal Office of Personnel Management, which affected about 18 million people, CNet.com reported.

Pence vowed the White House would take proactive measures to overhaul the country’s cyber-security systems, to prevent another attack.

The vice president also derided Russia for interfering in the 2016 presidential election and vowed the Trump administration would do more to prevent future cyber-attacks.

Pence’s denouncement of Russia was unprecedented, given President Trump’s ambiguous stance on election meddling, the Wall Street Journal reported.

“While other nations certainly possess the capability, the fact is Russia meddled in our 2016 elections,” Pence said, “That is the unambiguous judgment of our intelligence community, and, as the president said, we accept the intelligence community’s conclusion.”

Trump was widely criticized for appearing to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's assurance that Russia had not interfered in the 2016 election – just days after Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officials. But following widespread backlash, Trump reversed his position.

At the same New York event, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced several initiatives to combat future threats, Politico reported, including an election security task force, a supply chain task force and a National Risk Management center.

The risk management center will reportedly work to safeguard the nation’s banks, energy companies, and other major industries, the Journal reported.

"U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein fired a staffer a few years back who was allegedly part of an effort to spy and pass on political intelligence to the Chinese government.

The staffer, based in the Democrat's San Francisco office, was suspected of delivering political intelligence, though nothing top secret, to officials based at the local Chinese Consulate, Politico reported.

The FBI informed Feinstein, the then-chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, about five years ago about the staffer and allegations that the staffer was a spy. The source who confirmed the incident to the San Francisco Chronicle said “Dianne was mortified” upon learning about it.

The suspected spy served as the lawmaker’s driver in California, but took on other roles as well, including helping out in her San Francisco office and being Feinstein’s liaison to the Asian-American community in the state. He attended Chinese Consulate events on behalf of the senator.

A former official said that the spy’s handler “probably got an award back in China” for his efforts to penetrate Feinstein’s office and pass on intelligence.

The driver was reportedly recruited years ago after he being befriended on one of the trips to Asia by someone from China’s Ministry of State Security, the country’s intelligence and security agency, the Chronicle reported.

“He didn’t even know what was happening — that he was being recruited,” a source told the publication. “He just thought it was some friend.”

The FBI wasn’t able to charge the individual, possibly because he was passing on political intelligence rather than classified materials – making the prosecution nearly impossible.

“They interviewed him, and Dianne forced him to retire, and that was the end of it,” the Chronicle’s source said. “None of her staff ever knew what was going on. They just kept it quiet.”",politics
"A New York attorney general candidate wants to abolish the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency – and if she’s elected, she said she’ll “prosecute” it too.

Zephyr Teachout, who is running as a Democrat, said ICE has “become a tool of fear and illegality” in a video for Now This News where the Fordham University law professor stressed her support for abolishing the agency.

“As attorney general, I will continue to speak out against ICE. I will prosecute ICE for their criminal acts,” Teachout said. “We have stories of consistent abuse within ICE.”

“The idea that we can call this 'law enforcement' is a real offense to the idea of law itself,” Teachout continued.

Teachout isn’t the only Democrat – especially in New York – who has gotten behind the movement to abolish ICE, the agency that was created in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in the U.S. in 2001.

"Anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok insisted on preserving his security clearance and powers he held as a deputy assistant director at the agency before joining Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team, newly released emails show.

The emails, acquired by the conservative watchdog Judicial Watch, reveal that Strzok’s supervisor agreed to make him a “floating” deputy who would be able to approve national security letters and declassify documents – all while working on the Mueller team investigating the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with the Russian government.

“Broadly, I need to be able to act at least in the capacity of my old CD [counterintelligence division] DAD [deputy assistant director] job – approve NSLs [national security letters], conduct [redacted] declassify information, [redacted] agent travel, requisitions, etc. Of those, the most problematic and one of the most essential is declassification authority,” Strzok wrote in an email to Bill Priestap, FBI counterintelligence chief, dated July 13, 2017.

""Of those, the most problematic and one of the most essential is declassification authority."" - Peter Strzok

Priestap wrote back a few days later, saying his request was approved: “In answer to your initial question, while assigned to the special counsel’s office, you will retain your CD DAD authorities to include declassification authority.”

“Assuming the 7th floor approves, you will remain on CD’s books as a fourth (floating) DAD. When you move on from your DAD position, your DAD slot will revert back to HRD [human resources department],” he added.

Strzok's insistence on keeping the declassification authority raises concerns whether such authority gave the Mueller investigation special capabilities to target President Trump.

“It sure did,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told Fox News. “Strzok wouldn't have asked for it if he didn't think it'd be useful in his new job.”

“He wanted the authority to issue national security letters, which essentially are secret requests for information that fall short of needing court approval,” Fitton continued. “He also wanted – and he said this was ‘essential,’ which is very unusual – he wanted the ability to declassify information. He wanted to keep that ability.”

The FBI agent has been under fire ever since he was removed in the summer of 2017 after he exchanged tens of thousands of texts with then-colleague Lisa Page, with whom he had an extramarital affair, and expressed anti-Trump comments, raising questions of bias.

“[Trump's] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!” Page texted to Strzok in August 2016, months before Trump won the presidential election. “No. No he won't. We'll stop it,” Strzok responded.

"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka is getting an earful – on Twitter – from teachers union boss Randi Weingarten for reportedly keeping the door open to a possible Trump endorsement in 2020.

“Every [candidate] will be looked at,” Trumka said. He added, “we will consider every candidate who’s running.”

Trumka simply may have been stating union policy, not wanting to get ahead of an endorsement process that is nowhere close to starting, for an election more than two years out.

At the same time, he noted to Newsmax that Trump did better with AFL-CIO members than Mitt Romney did in 2012, while Hillary Clinton fared worse than then-President Barack Obama in 2012. And Trumka sought to explain why some union members backed the current president: “They were looking for someone who was going to change the economy. They felt there were assaults on their health care and assaults on their pensions.”

He went on to say most of Trump’s promises for working people have been “broken or unfulfilled,” while praising the president on trade.

Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, let rip when she saw the story posted with a headline saying Trumka “won’t rule out unions endorsing Trump.”

“THIS MUST BE A TYPO.. @RichardTrumka please clarify.... this can’t possibly be what you said,” Weingarten wrote.

She also tweeted, “In my convos w union members & workers all over USA, it’s clear they oppose the damage Trump is doing. Yes we want him to help steel workers but his tax giveaways to the rich, attacks on ACA, his divisiveness, his attacks on democracy & his caging of children are disqualifying.”

Asked Thursday about the story and the tweet, an AFL-CIO spokeswoman called the original headline ""click-bait"" and stressed the context of Trumka's remarks, which can be seen here. At the same panel discussion, Trumka openly voiced concern that he didn't want to see stories saying he'd endorse Trump.

Trumka and the AFL-CIO did endorse Clinton in the 2016 race. And in March of that year, Trumka delivered a blistering speech calling Trump a “bigot” who was “running on hate” and not really a friend of the working class.

Back in January, The Hill reported that Trumka said Trump was using his office to hurt working people, warning “if he continues down his current path, workers will be looking for a new president in 2020.” And Trumka was no fan of the June Supreme Court decision, reached with help from Trump's pick Justice Neil Gorsuch, against mandatory union fees for state government workers.

The union boss has tempered his language since, however, saying recently that Trump is moving in the right direction on trade, though his tariffs should be more focused.",politics
"As his former campaign chairman stands trial in the Robert Mueller investigation, President Trump went off yesterday, distancing himself from Paul Manafort and calling for the entire probe to be shut down.

What was striking is that he asked Jeff Sessions to do it, even though the attorney general recused himself from the Russia investigation last year—a move that continues to anger the president.

""This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!"" (No, I don’t know how the 13 angry Democrats became 17 either.)

In an interview yesterday, Rudy Giuliani told me that ""no order followed or will follow"" the president’s tweet, which were his ""opinions,"" and that no one should be confused.

""He didn't say anything different than I've said"" on the air, which is that ""the investigation should be concluded,"" the president's lawyer said.



When I asked how Trump could even suggest that Sessions take action, since the attorney general has recused himself, Giuliani said: ""I think he's talking more generic Justice Department,"" and that ""it would have to be Rosenstein,"" the deputy attorney general, to take such action.

Trump knows full well that for Sessions to pull the plug on the Mueller operation would create an enormous political firestorm. He undoubtedly knows that for Sessions to take that step, after saying it would be unethical for him as a former campaign surrogate to oversee the Russia probe, would destroy the AG's credibility. So it's possible that Trump is just venting here, using his Twitter platform to try to discredit Mueller and his team.

White House officials have argued for a year that the media spend too much time on their Russia obsession while short-changing such developments as a European Union trade deal and 4.1 percent growth in the GDP.

That is often true—but the president fuels the coverage of the investigation with his frequent Twitter attacks. The same goes for Giuliani and his latest television blitz. Trump very much wants the former mayor out there, but that spawns endless cable segments debating what he said (such as denying a pre-meeting before the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer when no one was talking about whether there was one).

Giuliani told me in the interview that he did so while trying to talk the New York Times out of running such a story (which the paper never did). And then, he said, ""I thought it would come out anyway in a less reputable publication, so I wanted to get it out first.""

The Manafort trial is a classic case study. Of course it's big news that the man who ran Trump's campaign during a key period in 2016 is being tried for fraud and lying.

But the words ""Trump"" and ""Russia"" have not been mentioned in the Alexandria courtroom. The Manafort indictment has virtually nothing to do with the campaign. He's charged with not paying taxes on millions of dollars from Ukraine and defrauding banks once that money spigot was cut off—plus such crimes against nature as buying a $15,000 ostrich coat.

The president weighed in with his barely-knew-the-guy tweet: ""Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn’t government tell me that he was under investigation.""

And there was this: ""Looking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and 'Public Enemy Number One,' or Paul Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?"" (Manafort is in jail because a judge ruled he violated the terms of his bail.)

Now it's true the Manafort trial (the first of two) is a test for Mueller, whose effort would be tarnished if he loses these cases. And critics can fairly question why Trump hired a veteran Washington lobbyist who turned out to be of questionable character.

And yet the Manafort trial is rather boring, with testimony about bank loans and tax documents, with the only real drama whether his former deputy Rick Gates—who pleaded guilty and is cooperating—will testify against him.

But with the president tweeting about Paul Manafort and Al Capone, he has shined a bright spotlight on the trial that journalists find impossible to ignore.",politics
"President Trump unspooled a wide-ranging defense of his foreign policy -- including recent meetings with the leaders of Russia and North Korea -- during a rally to boost support for U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta's Senate campaign.

In front of a full arena in Wilkes-Barre on Thursday, Trump mocked Barletta's Democratic opponent -- two-term incumbent Bob Casey -- as ""so overrated.""

""He will do whatever [Chuck] Schumer, [Nancy] Pelosi, and the new star of the Democrat Party tells him to do,"" said the president, who added Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., to that roster as the so-called ""new star"" and ""new leader"" of the Democratic party.

""Very low I.Q.,"" Trump said of Waters.

Barletta, a fervent Trump supporter who shares his hard-line views on immigration, then took the stage and rattled off a laundry list of Trump's accomplishments.

""We're not tired of winning, Mr. President,"" Barletta said. ""We're not tired of winning."" He then attacked Casey as ""one of the most liberal senators in Washington [who is] leading the Resistance and obstruction to President Trump's agenda... He no longer represents the values of people here in Pennsylvania.""

However, Barletta faces an uphill climb to defeat the Democrat, as two polls taken after his GOP primary victory show Casey with a double-digit lead.

Later on, Trump referred to Casey as ""Sleeping Bob"" and attacked his views on immigration, particularly his support of chain migration.

""By the way, if you ask him why, he can't [answer],"" Trump said as an aside. ""He wants it because Schumer said to have it.""

The president also rehashed his recent summits with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Appearing to be stung by criticism of both meetings, Trump claimed that his critics wanted him to attack Putin at the summit in Helsinki over Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

""They wanted me to walk up and go like this,"" Trump said before briefly walking away from his lectern and shadowboxing an imaginary Putin. ""They wanted me to go up and have a boxing match. Whatever happened to diplomacy?""

""And let me tell you, if I did go up and start screaming, they would have said, 'He was terrible! He was so rude! It was horrible! His performance was horrible!'"" Trump went on.

On North Korea, Trump claimed that he ""got along great with Chairman Kim. I got along great. That's a good thing, not a bad thing, by the way."" He also cited the return of American detainees and the lack of recent missile tests as signs of progress.

The president also continued to air his grievances against the media, at one point calling them ""the fake, fake disgusting news.""

""Whatever happened to the free press? Whatever happened to honest reporting?"" Trump asked, pointing to the media in the back of the hall. ""They don't report it. They only make up stories ... Only negative stories from the fakers back there.""

Trump, the first Republican presidential candidate to win Pennsylvania since George H.W. Bush in 1988, began his speech with a lengthy reminiscence about his 2016 victory. At one point, he lamented the media's supposed slowness in calling the state for him on election night.

""You people didn't get the privilege of taking us over the top,"" the president said before promising, ""next time, next time.""

Turning briefly to the 2020 election, Trump also speculated about whether he wanted Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whom he decried as ""Pocahontas,"" or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whom he flatly deemed ""crazy,"" as his opponent.

Trump has accelerated his campaign schedule in recent weeks to help Republicans he favors both in primaries and November's midterms. On Tuesday, he headlined a Florida rally to support U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis in his campaign for governor and has sought to boost outgoing Gov. Rick Scott in what is expected to be a close Senate race against incumbent Bill Nelson.

On Saturday, Trump will travel to Ohio to hold a rally for State Sen. Troy Balderson, who is running for Congress in a special election to be held next week.

"Non-American citizens are increasingly found on voter rolls thanks to covert registration methods, with nothing actually stopping them from casting a ballot in an election.

Elizaveta Shuvalova, a Russian citizen who became a U.S. citizen only last year, was registered as an eligible voter in 2012 and added to the San Francisco voter rolls, the Washington Times reported.

She was perplexed to find herself in the voter rolls, saying she wasn’t an American citizen and didn’t even register to vote.

“I’ve never registered for anything in my entire life,” Shuvalova told the paper. “This is news to me.”

“I’ve never registered for anything in my entire life. This is news to me.” - Elizaveta Shuvalova, who became a U.S. citizen in 2017, but has been on voter rolls since 2012

The woman’s voter log shows that she signed up as a Democrat in July 2012. In 2016, her registration was canceled after she informed election authorities that she wasn't eligible to vote because she wasn't yet a U.S. citizen.

“This is definitely a shocker to me. It is like an identity fraud because this is not coming from my end,” the woman, who identifies as a Democrat, said. “Like I told you, I haven’t even been a citizen during that time frame. So what can we do about it?”

NON-CITIZENS, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NOW MAY REGISTER TO VOTE IN SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS

But the case of Shuvalova is part of a larger concern some groups have when it comes integrity of elections. They claim that stories like hers are a common occurence in many parts of the country.

The Public Interest Legal Foundation, a nonprofit specializing in election integrity, found that non-Americans are being added to voter rolls in states such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia.

The group says that a large portion of the non-citizens even managed to cast their ballots in elections as well. For instance, in 2017, the group found that nearly 5,600 people on the voter rolls in Virginia were deemed as non-citizens, with a third of them voting in previous elections.

""Our voter registration system masks non-citizens and allows the opportunity to vote until they decide to self-report at their own peril. All of this could have been prevented if states actually verified citizen eligibility upfront."" - PILF research director Logan Churchwell

“Our voter registration system masks non-citizens and allows the opportunity to vote until they decide to self-report at their own peril. All of this could have been prevented if states actually verified citizen eligibility upfront,” Logan Churchwell, communications and research director for the foundation, told the Times.

Shuvalova could have been added on voter rolls after signing a 2013 petition for a ballot initiative concerning housing development in San Francisco.

John Arntz, director of the San Francisco Department of Elections, told the Times that a signed registration card was submitted to the office to qualify the woman as a signer of the petition. He added that activists often distribute registration cards along with their petitions.

Normally, election authorities should check the registration application with other databases such as the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles and the secretary of state’s office to ensure the person is a citizen.

In Shuvalova’s case, however, she wasn’t detected as a non-citizen and she began receiving voting ballots. She received nine of them, but never actually voted. She reportedly returned one ballot in 2016 but only to inform officials that she wasn't a citizen and therefore wasn't eligible to vote.

The San Francisco election official said that Shuvalova could have easily gotten away with voting in elections before 2016 and she probably would have remained on the voter rolls as an eligible voter had she not informed officials.

But Arntz told the Times that the woman’s story isn’t a reflection on whole the integrity of the election system.

“If it was a problem, this would be an issue that comes up every election or something we would have experienced more through time. But it doesn’t,” he said.

“This is the first instance that I’ve actually had a conversation like this,” he continued. “So, no, I don’t think it is a problem. I don’t think there’s many records out there like this.”

He added that nobody in San Francisco has yet been prosecuted for being a non-citizen on the voter rolls.

“I can’t remember forwarding an allegation that someone was a non-citizen who registered to vote or did vote,” Arntz said.",politics
"The Trump administration on Thursday moved to freeze fuel economy standards in what officials described as an effort to give drivers access to “safer” and “more affordable” vehicles, in the latest swipe at former President Barack Obama's legacy.

The proposal comes just one day after the Trump administration announced major changes to health plans, providing consumers with more options to buy cheaper, short-term health insurance.

The Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency proposed the vehicle change as the first formal step in setting new standards for model years 2021 through 2026. The plan would freeze the Obama-era requirements set to take effect after 2020.

“There are compelling reasons for a new rulemaking on fuel economy standards for 2021-2026,” Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao said in a statement Thursday. “More realistic standards will promote a healthy economy by bringing newer, safer, cleaner and more fuel-efficient vehicles to U.S. roads and we look forward to receiving input from the public.”

The administration also filed notice Thursday that it wants to revoke the authority of California and other states to set their own, stricter mileage standards -- independent of federal ones.

Acting EPA Director Andrew Wheeler said the change would strike a balance.

“Our proposal aims to strike the right regulatory balance based on the most recent information and create a 50-state solution that will enable more Americans to afford, newer, safer vehicles that pollute less,” Wheeler said in a statement. “More realistic standards can save lives while continuing to improve the environment.”

The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the administration supports freezing the mileage standards after 2020, but would seek public comment now on that proposal and a range of others, including leaving the tighter, Obama administration fuel standards in place.

The current standards, according to the Department of Transportation, have been a factor in the rising costs of new cars to an average of $35,000 or more, which they argue is “out of reach” for most American families.

AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE IS HERE: HHS SEC ALEX AZAR

Keeping the current standards in place, which were finalized in 2012, would add $2,340 to the cost of owning a new car, and would impose more than $500 billion in costs to the economy over the next 50 years, according to the Department of Transportation.

The Trump administration argued that the “ever-increasing” vehicle fuel efficiency standards have a negative effect on highway safety.

“Cars are more expensive, and if cars are more expensive, people buy fewer new cars,” EPA Assistant Administrator Bill Wherum told reporters Thursday, explaining that people are driving older cars as opposed to new “cleaner” and more efficient vehicles. “That translates into higher fatalities and injuries on the road due to accidents.”

The Department of Transportation and the EPA estimated that the rule could save 1,000 lives annually.

Immediately following the announcement, New York's Democratic Attorney General Barbara Underwood, part of a coalition of 20 other attorneys general, threatened to take the administration to court.

""Freezing or weakening these standards puts the health of our children, seniors, and all communities at risk, and increases the rising costs of climate change for our states,"" Underwood said in a statement. ""This decision upends decades of cooperative state and federal action to protect our residents. We are prepared to go to court to put the brakes on this reckless and illegal plan.”

Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, called the proposed rule ""a massive pileup of bad ideas"" that would increase pollution and raise fuel costs for consumers.

He said in a statement that the organization would challenge the administration's action ""in the court of public opinion and the court of law.""

The proposed rule is the most recent Trump administration effort to roll back Obama-era policies. On Wednesday, the administration’s short-term health insurance plan provided an option to consumers separate from ObamaCare.

The plans would last up to 12 months and can be renewed for up to 36 months, with premiums reaching just one-third of comprehensive, full coverage. The plan is geared to Americans who want an individual health insurance policy, but who make too much money to qualify for ObamaCare subsidies.

Democrats blasted the short term policy as ""junk insurance"" on Wednesday, suggesting the plan would raise premiums for sick Americans and put people at risk.

Despite the new plan, the Trump administration has yet to fully repeal ObamaCare, as candidate-Trump and so many Republicans promised on the campaign trail.

But last year, as part of the GOP tax overhaul, Trump successfully repealed the individual mandate penalty--which was the linchpin of Obama’s signature health care law. The individual mandate required Americans to buy insurance or face a penalty. Official estimates predict that 4 million more people would be uninsured when the mandate repeal takes effect, and that 13 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2027.

Trump has also successfully scrapped other massive policies and agreements made under the Obama administration.

Last year, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, which was negotiated by Obama, and earlier this year, Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal.

"Underdog conservative outsider Bill Lee upset a crowded field of well-funded, better-known candidates to win Tennessee's Republican gubernatorial primary Thursday, sending shockwaves through a state where he was down double-digits in polls as recently as last month.

U.S. Rep. Diane Black, who had the endorsement of Vice President Mike Pence, was the clear favorite in the race. Former state economic development chief Randy Boyd, who had the backing of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, was widely considered Black's chief rival.

But President Trump, who has a 56 percent approval rating in Tennessee, stopped short of endorsing any candidate in the race, including Black -- despite keeping her by his side and praising her at several events.

Lee, a businessman whose poll numbers surged dramatically in the last week of the campaign, took advantage of infighting among his rivals, as he traveled the state and touted his Christian values while Boyd and Black sparred.

On the eve of the primary vote, supporters of Black's campaign, perhaps realizing the threat posed by Lee's insurgent candidacy, released an attack advertisement suggesting Lee's company had terminated an employee and Army National Guard member for being deployed.

Lee strongly denied the allegations, and his company sent out a cease-and-desist letter concerning the messaging.

Harsh rhetoric in the campaign was backed by big money. The top four Republican contenders for governor, including Black, Lee, Boyd, and State House Speaker Beth Harwell, spent a combined $40 million of their own personal wealth fighting over who is more devoted to Trump, setting records and underscoring the president's continuing influence in state races. The candidates were seeking to replace the state's term-limited Gov. Bill Haslam.

Former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean, a moderate, won the Democratic primary for the state's governorship, defeating state House Minority Leader Craig Fitzhugh in a mostly cordial race. But the surprising results in the Republican gubernatorial primary contest will reverberate nationally, serving as a bellwether for Trump enthusiasm and establishment influence in a state that supported the president by double digits in 2016.

Meanwhile, the Democratic and Republican Senate primaries on Thursday provided less drama, but posed perhaps even greater national significance.

U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn won the Republican nomination in Tennessee's open U.S. Senate race to replace the retiring Sen. Bob Corker, which holds major implications for Democrats' chances for overturning the 51-49 Republican Senate majority in November.

Blackburn easily overcame minimal opposition in Thursday's primary. She and former Gov. Phil Bredesen, who won the state's Democratic primary on Thursday, have long looked past the primaries to their upcoming general election matchup.

Polls have shown Blackburn and Bredesen are neck-and-neck in the race, which Fox News currently assesses is a tossup. Blackburn could become the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate by Tennessee voters.

She calls herself a ""hardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative"" who would fight for President Donald Trump's agenda.

Bredesen is running as an independent thinker who says he will work with Trump when his ideas make sense for Tennessee and oppose him when they don't.



MEET THE CANDIDATES: WHO ARE THE KEY PLAYERS IN TENNESSEE'S GUBERNATORIAL RACE?

The Blackburn-Bredesen showdown is among several races crucial to Trump’s plans to maintain control of the Senate, where Republicans are defending a narrow two-seat majority. If Democrats retake the Senate, it would deal a major blow to Trump's agenda, hampering his ability to appoint federal judges and all but killing the prospect of signature initiatives like a southern border wall.

Trump has endorsed Blackburn, an eight-term congresswoman, and traveled to Tennessee in May to campaign for her. Blackburn told Fox News at the time that Trump's support had helped her candidacy build ""momentum.""

Blackburn served on Trump’s transition team and has not shied away from embracing the president. She is one of the lawmakers who signed onto a letter nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize.

In a Thursday appearance, Governor Haslam touted Blackburn's candidacy. The governor suggested that keeping Republican Senate control is important in part because Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander would lose his health committee chairmanship, among other leadership changes.

Bredesen, 74, has helped his viability in the red state by assuring voters that he is not hyperpartisan and promising he is not “running against” Trump. If elected, he will become the first Democrat to win a Senate campaign in the Volunteer State since Al Gore in 1990.

BATTLE LINES DRAWN AS DEMOCRATS HOPE TO FLIP CRITICAL TENNESSEE SENATE SEAT

A Harvard graduate worth tens of millions of dollars, Bredesen has touted his business credentials, saying they will help him win over “economic Republicans, the more traditional-minded Republicans"" in November.

He also has received some high-profile support of his own. Corker, a Republican and frequent Trump critic, has praised Bredesen in the race, calling him a ""very good mayor, a very good governor, a very good business person.""

By contrast, Corker has often had harsh words for Trump. In a dramatic moment at a hearing in July, for example, Corker pressed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to explain what he characterized as Trump's ""purposeful"" efforts to sow misinformation and discord.

WATCH: POMPEO FIGHTS BACK AFTER CORKER HITS TRUMP FOR SOWING 'DISTRUST' ON PURPOSE

Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has previously acknowledged his attacks on Trump might not be endearing him to many of his constituents.

Tennessee, like its southern neighbors, was once dominated by Democrats. But it hasn't elected one to statewide office since 2006, and in 2012 Republicans secured supermajorities in both houses for the first time since Reconstruction.

Voters also decided on nominees for nine House races on Thursday.

"Two years into the Trump administration, aggrieved activists are not only accosting Cabinet members or driving them out of restaurants -- they're increasingly taking out their frustration on inanimate objects.

A burst of anti-Trump vandalism against possessions and property associated with administration officials is the latest flare-up in a “resistance” that has taken many forms.

Last year, protesters marked the anniversary of President Trump's election by screaming at the sky. Lately, the tactics have become more confrontational, touching off a national debate over civility in politics.

But smashing and spray-painting are yet another outlet. Here are some of the items that have been the focus of anti-Trump activists’ rage.

Trump’s Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame



Trump’s star on the Walk of Fame has been subjected to repeat acts of vandalism, with one protester going so far as to smash it with a pick ax last month.

Brawls have since broken out at the spot after crowds of Trump supporters and protesters gathered near the contentious marker.

But this isn’t the first time the star has been under assault. Back in 2016, before Trump was elected, the star was defaced by a vandal who scratched off his name and a TV icon. The vandal told TMZ he was doing it so that the removed parts could be auctioned for the legal defense of Trump accusers.

Earlier that year, the star was defaced in February of 2016 when someone spray-painted it with a swastika.



Betsy DeVos’ Yacht



A $40 million boat owned by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was untied from its Ohio dock last week, causing it to drift into a dock and incur up to $10,000 in damages. The vessel, named the Seaquest, ended up with large scratches before the crew was able to get control of it.

DeVos is unlikely to be too troubled by the damage -- the Seaquest is one of 10 vessels owned by the DeVos family.



Ben Carson’s House



Ben Carson, the Housing and Urban Development secretary, said in a Facebook post last August that his home in Virginia, along with his neighbor’s house, was vandalized by anti-Trump types who “wrote hateful rhetoric about President Trump.”



“We were out of town, but other kind, embarrassed neighbors cleaned up most of the mess before we returned,” Carson said.



Trump Golf Courses



Of all the officials in the Trump administration, President Trump will always be the main villain in the eyes of his opponents. This, in turn, makes his properties a prime target.



The Trump International Golf Course near his Florida estate was hit by splotches of red paint in April, obscuring some of the letters on the sign at the entrance of the club in West Palm Beach.

In October, a Hawaii man reportedly was charged with criminal mischief for defacing four golf courses owned by the Trump Organization, by allegedly carving messages into the greens.

Trump International Hotel

In October 2016, Trump's hotel in downtown Washington D.C. was vandalized with the phrases ""black lives matter"" and ""no justice, no peace.""

In May 2017, the same hotel briefly had messages in light projected onto the hotel, including one that said ""Pay Trump Bribes Here."" Another read ""emoluments welcome,"" in reference to the controversy surrounding Trump's alleged financial conflicts.

Trump Paraphernalia

Make America Great Again? Well, don't declare it too loudly, as there have been multiple reports of Trump supporters being accosted for wearing a MAGA cap, or other signs of Trump support.

Just this week, a woman in Massachusetts was taken into custody after allegedly deliberately ramming into a car sporting a Trump bumper sticker.

“She said, ‘You voted for Trump?’” the man she hit recalled her saying. “I said yes. She called me a racist and several other names.” The man then claimed that the woman repositioned her vehicle and hit his car with hers, the Cape Cod Times said, citing the police report. After this, the woman reportedly left the scene.

"Special Counsel Robert Mueller has finally responded to a letter from President Trump's outside attorneys about what the scope and format of a potential interview with the president would be, sources familiar with the investigation told Fox News on Wednesday.

The sources said Mueller has agreed to cut the number of questions for Trump from an initial list of 49 and is willing to have some questions answered in writing – though he wants other questions answered orally.

However, the sources added that Mueller has not agreed to the president's demands to limit his questioning to matters related to allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The special prosecutor still wants to ask the president about obstruction of justice and other topics.

The sources also said talks with the special counsel about a possible interview are continuing, but as one source said: ""There is still a long way to go.""

While the Trump legal team's current posture is still not to have the president sit for an interview with Mueller, a source familiar with the investigation told Fox News, “never say never.”

Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, speaking to reporters following an appearance at a Republican congressional campaign event in New Hampshire, said the president's legal team had received ""a letter back"" from the special counsel's team on Tuesday and ""now we're in the process of responding to their proposal.""

""I'm not going to give you a lot of hope it's going to happen,"" Giuliani said of a potential Trump-Mueller sitdown, ""but we're still negotiating.""

On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop Mueller's ""Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further.""

Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation last year, handing off that responsibility to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Trump has asserted previously that Mueller has too many conflicts of interest for him to fairly lead the investigation, citing his ties to fired former FBI Director James Comey as well as what the president called a ""very nasty & contentious business relationship"" in a tweet earlier this week.

Democratic lawmakers said Wednesday that Trump's Sessions tweet amounted to obstruction of justice. But White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the message represented ""the president's opinion"" and not an order to the Justice Department.

""If he wanted to obstruct [the investigation], he'd obstruct it, just end it,"" Giuliani said of Trump in New Hampshire. ""Then you'd all battle whether he has the legal right to do that, which I think he does. But he's not going to do that. He's made it clear he wants it to run its course.""

"For months, Palestinian militants have been sending balloons and kites rigged with incendiary devices (some bearing swastikas) over the border from the Gaza Strip to Israel -- causing devastation to land, crops and livelihoods.



Now Israel is calling out the United Nations for allegedly ignoring such attacks as it focuses on Israel instead.



As part of a broader effort to bring attention to the attacks, Israel’s Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon opened up an exhibit at U.N. headquarters showing the devastation from the recent attacks.

“We follow very carefully what's happening in Israel, and unfortunately people don’t get it at the U.N. when we speak about the fact they have more than 7,000 acres that have been set on fire -- that’s half the size of Manhattan,” Danon told Fox News on Thursday.

'They have more than 7,000 acres that have been set on fire -- that’s half the size of Manhattan.' - Ambassador Danny Danon

Israel says more than 700 fires have been caused by the attacks, resulting in millions of dollars in damage to farms and businesses. One recent balloon landed in the yard of a kindergarten, though there were no injuries.



The images on display at the U.N., captured by local photographers, include one of a tractor surrounded by flames as a farmer watches his crops go up in smoke.



But while the U.N. waxes lyrical about environmental protection and the importance of conservation, food security and non-violence, Danon says key bodies have been silent on this issue.



“No one will speak about it. That's what I feel in the Security Council, in the General Assembly, so we set up this exhibition here to allow ambassadors to understand it,” Danon said, adding that he asks ambassadors who visit what they would do if 7,000 acres of their homeland were set on fire by terrorists.



“I ask them, ‘What would you do if this happened in your country?’”



Danon also noted the presence of a large sign outside the exhibit: “The holding of the exhibit in U.N. premises does not imply endorsement by the United Nations.”



Farhan Haq, a spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told Fox News that the U.N. Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohamed had received a letter about the subject from Israel, and that U.N. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov has visited Gaza and called for such attacks to cease.

Guterres has also called on ""Hamas and other Palestinian militants to cease the launching of rockets and incendiary kites and provocations"" but also urged Israel to ""exercise restraint to avoid further inflaming the situation.""



Both Israel and the U.S. have been ramping up pressure on the international body to rid itself of anti-Israel bias and call out terrorist acts by groups like Hamas and Hezbollah by name. With Ambassador Nikki Haley taking the reins at the U.S. mission last year, combating anti-Israel bias has become a top U.S. priority.



The U.S. has in recent months pulled out of the Human Rights Council and slashed funding to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA). Last month, Haley blasted Arab countries who make anti-Israel speeches but don’t commit funding to help the Palestinian cause.



“If those words were useful in the schools, the hospitals, and the streets of their communities, the Palestinian people would not be facing the desperate conditions we are discussing here today,” she said on the floor of the Security Council. “But talk is cheap.”



Haley also mentioned what she called the “terrorist flaming swastika kites” and agreed with Danon: “If it was happening to any of our countries, there would be quite a lot of discussion on it.”



The U.S. and Israel have been attempting a new tactic at the U.N., namely inserting language into anti-Israel resolutions that directly condemns Hamas. This had some success in a recent motion on the floor of the General Assembly, where an amendment condemning Hamas picked up a slim 62-58 majority.

HALEY PRESSURES ARAB STATES TO STEP UP ON PALESTINIAN AID: 'WE ARE NOT FOOLS'



“My team together with Ambassador Haley and her team, we will insist on that. When you need to name Hezbollah you will name Hezbollah, even if we vote on it and lose it, we will insist on that. Same with Hamas, so you cannot say we condemn acts of violence without saying who is responsible for that,” Danon said.



While other motions have failed, Danon said he has a good relationship with Haley, as well as an open dialogue with Guterres, and there are signs of a paradigm shift at the U.N.



“I think we are successful in changing the rules of the game ... and we are starting to feel that change,” he said.

"The judge in the Paul Manafort trial reminded Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team on Friday of the high bar for conviction -- that they must prove the former Trump campaign chairman knowingly violated tax and bank laws related to his political work overseas.

On the trial's fourth day, U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis III indicated he believes the prosecution has demonstrated Manafort had control of foreign bank accounts despite checking a box on tax returns saying he didn’t have them.

But Ellis reminded prosecutors, “The government has to prove that [Manafort] knew what the requirement was and that he deliberately violated it.”

Ellis also reminded prosecutors they have to prove Manafort's “willfulness” in failing to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts.

Manafort, facing charges of bank and tax fraud related to his political work in Ukraine, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

MANAFORT STRUGGLED TO PAY BILLS IN 2016, BOOKKEEPER TESTIFIES

A source close to Manafort’s team told Fox News the defense has not yet decided whether to have Manafort testify during the trial. This person said they will make the decision after the prosecution rests its case, which could be next week.

Friday’s testimony has focused on the tax fraud charges. The years involved, 2010 to 2014, were before Manafort worked for President Trump's campaign. Though the case stems from Mueller's probe of election meddling by Russia and possible collusion by the Trump campaign, there has been no mention of election interference.

Manafort served as chairman of Trump’s presidential campaign during the summer of 2016, and was forced out in August of that year amid news stories about his ties to then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

On Friday, Philip Ayliff, a CPA who prepared Manafort’s taxes, testified Manafort signed tax returns that showed “none” checked for any foreign bank accounts between the years 2010 and 2014.

The government pointed out that Manafort signed his tax returns “under penalty of perjury.""

Prosecutor Uza Asonye walked Ayliff through each year and asked “what did Mr. Manafort say for this year for foreign bank accounts?”

Ayliff responded “none” for each one.

The prosecution also showed documents where the accountant emailed Manafort asking if he had foreign accounts, and Manafort responded that he didn't.

But Mueller's team says Manafort repeatedly used accounts in Cyprus to pay for an array of luxury items and services.

Prosecutors have introduced a host of exhibits and are in the process of calling several witnesses as part of their effort to paint Manafort as a tax scofflaw who failed to report money spent on luxury items -- then lied to get bank loans when his foreign consulting work dried up.

The prosecution has released exhibit photos of Manafort's expensive clothes, including a $15,000 ostrich coat and other pricey suits.

On Thursday, Manafort’s bookkeeper, Heather Washkuhn of the firm NKFSB, testified that Manafort racked up large bills but struggled to pay them in 2016.

“Did there come a time in 2016 when Mr. Manafort had trouble paying his bills?” prosecutor Greg Andres asked the accountant in federal court in Alexandria, Va.

“Yes,” Washkuhn replied.

The Manafort defense hinges on convincing jurors that Manafort was the boss who didn’t handle bills or accounts, but left that to his deputy, Rick Gates, who is cooperating with prosecutors and may testify as its star witness.

“Rick Gates had his hand in the cookie jar and couldn’t let his boss find out,” Manafort defense attorney Thomas Zehnle said during opening arguments.

Ellis, a 78-year-old Reagan-appointed judge in the case known for colorful comments, said this week the prosecution cannot prove a key part of their case unless prosecutors call Gates to the stand.

"Ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s accountant testified Friday in federal court that she had concerns about the accuracy of her client's tax returns but filed them anyway.

The testimony, on the fourth day of the trial, comes as prosecutors try to prove that Manafort knowingly violated tax and bank laws related to his political work overseas. Manafort has pleaded not guilty.

Cynthia Laporta, a certified public accountant with the firm KWC who is testifying with immunity, admitted she did have concerns about the representations given to her about loans by Manafort and his business partner, Rick Gates.

“Did you believe those representations?” Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye asked Laporta on Friday afternoon.

“No,” she replied.

“Did you still file those taxes?” Asonye asked.

“Yes,” Laporta said.

Laporta confirmed she was testifying under immunity because of the fear that she could be prosecuted for her actions.

Laporta also told prosecutors she “very much” regrets filing Manafort’s tax returns.

“At the time did you believe it was right or wrong?” Asonye asked.

JUDGE CAUTIONS MULLER TEAM ON HIGH BAR FOR MANAFORT CONVICTION

“Wrong,” answered Laporta. “I could have refused to file ... but that could expose the firm"" to the risk of litigation.

Laporta went on to say she could have called Manafort and Gates liars, but said Manafort was “a longtime client.”

The Manafort defense hinges on convincing jurors that Manafort was the boss who didn’t handle bills or accounts, but left that to Gates, who is cooperating with prosecutors and may testify as its star witness.

"EXCLUSIVE: President Trump’s newly installed Veterans Affairs secretary, in his first interview since taking office earlier this week, sounded the alarm about the need to fix a critical program allowing veterans to see local private doctors instead of driving long distances to a VA hospital.

If the federal government falls short, Secretary Robert Wilkie warned, “then the entire system collapses.”

For Wilkie, it’s among the most pressing in an array of challenges he confronts upon taking the helm at the government’s second-largest department – and perhaps its most scandal-scarred.

'If we don’t get a hold of what we owe Americans who are providing services to our veterans, then the entire system collapses.' - VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, on doctor payments

From his office perch two blocks from the White House, Wilkie surveyed the task ahead and homed in on the popular private-doctor program used by millions of veterans. He told Fox News he has promised the president he will address one glaring problem in particular: doctors getting stiffed by the VA.

“The Veterans Affairs Department in the last eight to nine years has not been paying those bills to small-town doctors, to community hospital emergency care facilities,” he said.

WATCH JENNIFER GRIFFIN’S EXCLUSIVE TWO-PART INTERVIEW WITH VA SECRETARY ROBERT WILKIE ON ‘SPECIAL REPORT WITH BRET BAIER’ FRIDAY AT 6 PM ET AND 'FOX NEWS @ NIGHT' WITH SHANNON BREAM AT 11 PM ET.

At issue is a program that was revamped under this administration.

In June, Trump signed a bill to replace the troubled Veterans Choice Program, enacted in 2014 under then-President Barack Obama, to expand access for veterans wishing to see private doctors and other providers to ease the burden on families forced to drive long distances for VA care.

“It makes no sense to me that we require someone to travel -- let's use a state like Montana -- where the distances are enormous, 600 or 700 miles round trip,” said Wilkie. “They pass a lot of doctors along the way. We need to bring those doctors into the Veterans Affairs system.”

Wilkie said, though, if they can’t fix the doctor payment issue and “if we don’t get a hold of what we owe Americans who are providing services to our veterans, then the entire system collapses.”

That’s just the start to his challenges at the sprawling department.

The VA has suffered from a series of high-profile scandals in recent years involving secret wait-lists, systemic neglect and even veterans dying while waiting to see a doctor. Wilkie is the fourth secretary to lead the VA in the past four years.

The VA’s $200 billion budget has doubled in the past decade. The new secretary said of the 370,000 employees under that network, “there are probably 100 bad eggs” in the system still.

One of the first things Wilkie vowed to turn around, though, is a perceived morale problem at the agency that’s supposed to serve 9 million veterans.

""This is an institution that has been buffeted by continuous body blows for a number of years,"" Wilkie admitted.

To tackle the problem, Wilkie plans to be more visible not only at headquarters in Washington but VA hospitals throughout the country. Wilkie said he spent his first day-and-a-half as secretary walking the halls to meet staff, and is joining them for meals in the cafeteria.

“I don't think those simple things have been done,” Wilkie said. “I fall back on my military life. I learned at a very early age, listening to those around my family, that in order to be a commander you had to walk your post.”

Wilkie is the son of an Army field artillery commander, severely wounded after multiple tours in Vietnam.

“He spent a year in Army hospitals. He came back to us weighing about half of what he did when he left. I watched his recovery. It was agonizing,” Wilkie recalled.

So he knows firsthand the struggles of families whose sons and daughters are amputees from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, some of whom have been denied wheelchairs because of sloppy paperwork.

“It’s a culture in some respects that just looks at a patient as just a generic number coming through the system,” he said. “And that's not the way it should be.”

Wilkie said amputees and other severely wounded combat vets “need to be at the front of the line.”

Asked to pledge to get rid of a widely criticized process forcing amputees to make repeated trips to the VA to prove they’re still an amputee, Wilkie replied, “Absolutely.”

Wilkie also sought to clear the air on Democratic senators’ suggestions that the administration is eyeing a privatization of the whole system.

At his confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill weeks after Trump signed the $55 billion bill to fix Veterans Choice, Wilkie faced a hostile reception from Democratic senators demanding to know if he planned to do just that, something Wilkie’s predecessor said was the reason for his firing—not moving to privatize fast enough.

In the interview with Fox News, Wilkie noted such a move would need support from Capitol Hill and said the agency’s growing budget does not reflect a move to privatize.

Pressed on whether Trump has set that as a goal, Wilkie said, “No. The president wants to deliver the best care possible.”

Wilkie also downplayed a Washington Post report that he is planning to sideline Trump loyalists who have purged longtime VA staff since his predecessor was fired.

“No. In fact, I haven't removed anybody,” Wilkie replied, but wouldn’t rule out doing so in the future. ""As part of any new leadership organization, you come in with a team. You come in to assess. You come in to rearrange.""

Firing those who have given the VA a bad name has proved a challenge.

Last year, a disgraced former director of the Washington, D.C., VA had to be rehired just one month after being fired – even though, under his watch, it was found that inventories were so mismanaged that doctors had to run out mid-procedure and borrow from neighboring hospitals while patients were under anesthesia.

“The laws now give you the authority to override most of what I would consider to be the normal bureaucratic protections for those in those situations,” Wilkie said.

Another problem is the loss of talent at the VA. More than 20,000 civil servants have left since the start of the Trump administration. Some top jobs remain vacant after 15 months, and the department is short 33,000 doctors and nurses.

“We’re going to go crazy trying to fill all 33,000,”he said.

Wilkie served as undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness under Defense Secretary Jim Mattis before being tapped by Trump to lead the VA, after the president ousted Dr. David Shulkin in late March.

Asked if he was worried he might suffer the same fate as his predecessor, fired by tweet, Wilkie replied, “No, the last thing I will pay attention to is any of the usual Washington back and forth. This president has been magnificent to me.”

Wilkie also served in the Pentagon under Donald Rumsfeld, worked for Condoleezza Rice and had years of experience on Capitol Hill working for Sens. Thom Tillis and Trent Lott.

In his new office, Wilkie now hangs a portrait of Gen. Omar Bradley, the first secretary of Veterans Affairs after World War II, and has chosen Bradley's desk as his own.

""Bradley was tasked with changing VA to accommodate 11 million soldiers coming off active duty and into VA ranks,” he said. “He was really a visionary.”

Fast-forward to modern times, and the VA is still grappling with similar challenges, absorbing the soldiers who have come home from two wars stretching back nearly two decades.

Wilkie ended the interview with a message to those veterans: “Something that people need to know: We don't turn veterans down. A private facility might; we don't.”",politics
"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the socialist congressional candidate from New York who touts honesty and authenticity as her greatest strengths, used to describe herself as a follower of Adam Smith, the so-called father of capitalism -- and said that terms like “feminism” and “empowerment” were “relics from the past.”

Since then, Ocasio-Cortez has come out as an unapologetic democratic socialist, wishing to see greater taxation and expansion and creation of wide-ranging social programs such as a single-payer health care system, free education, and housing as a right.

“I think my strength is I’m honest and authentic,” she told “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah last week. Those qualities helped her in June to beat top Democrat Joe Crowley, whose name was floated as the next speaker of the U.S. House.

But not that long ago, 28-year-old Ocasio-Cortez harbored a lot milder if not radically different views. During her time at Boston University, where she studied economics and international relations and graduated in 2011 with cum laude honors, she described herself as a believer in Adam Smith’s analyses and wrote a number of blog posts hinting at her views, according to posts reviewed by Fox News.

“Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez believes in Mahatma Ghandi’s methods, Adam Smith’s analyses, and Pablo Neruda’s love. Her experiences growing up in a Puerto Rican household, from the boroughs to beyond, has afforded her a uniquely American experience with all the tragedy and hilarity it accompanies,” she described herself in a student-run publication called BU Culture Shock, which she co-founded.

""Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez believes in Mahatma Ghandi’s methods, Adam Smith’s analyses, and Pablo Neruda’s love."" - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's description on student blog she co-founded

In a 2009 blog post, Ocasio-Cortez called feminism into question, writing that “the terms ‘feminism’ and ‘empowerment’ don’t seem to capture the priorities of our generation, and the words themselves sound like relics from the past, frumpy and outdated.”

“We no longer live in the same fight for equality of prior generations, we have moved to the widely accepted reality that marginalizing 50% of a given population doesn’t make much sense, mathematically or socially,” she wrote.

“We no longer live in the same fight for equality of prior generations."" - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

The New York Democrat could also learn a few things from herself, having written in a 2009 post that while health care in the U.S. is “at its most critical crossroads” in recent history, the debate about it is moving slowly for a “good reason.”

That reason being that “health care is largely an intersection of money and people, which means health care discussions often involve the prioritizing of people according to available funds. How can one possibly measure the needs of children, the elderly, the sick, and the healthy against one another?”

Most blog posts written during Ocasio-Cortez's reign at the publication, which include articles on issues like Donald Trump’s 2012 run for president and Israel-Palestine conflict, aren’t available and only a select few were reviewed by Fox News.

Boston University’s Howard Thurman Center, which sponsored the publication, said the archives couldn’t be located as the staff at the center changed and new staffers lacked access to the old posts.

Yet Ocasio-Cortez's claim of being a follower of a pro-capitalist economist will surely raise questions about her authenticity, as Smith, the 18th century Scottish economist, advocated free-market capitalism and opposed government regulations – contrary to what Ocasio-Cortez, a card-carrying Democratic Socialists of America member, now pitches on the campaign trail.

“There’s just no doubt about it,” Howard Husock, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow, told Fox News about Smith being a polar opposite of the New York socialist. “First of all, Adam Smith believed so strongly in price signals, which are telling us what’s desired, what’s being offered, it allows people who are selling things to adjust their prices to meet demand – they're just central to how the whole economy works.”

“So as soon as you have Medicare for all, you essentially are abolishing price signals when it comes to health care. Because the government is not just a one more competitor or one more choice. It kills the whole playing field,” Husock added.

Jeffrey Miron, a director of economic studies at the Cato Institute and director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Economics at Harvard University, seconded that there are problems in reconciling one's views of a follower of Smith’s analyses and being a democratic socialist.

“I do fully agree that there are tensions between being a Smithian and espousing the views that the social democrats espouse. In order to do massively more redistribution, you have to raise massively more taxes,” Miron said, noting that that would have a negative impact on the economy. “Smith would certainly never endorse that.”

“If Ocasio-Cortez were to say today that she’s a Smithian, but yet advocate for things she advocates, she’s trying to have a cake and eat it too,” he added.

""If Ocasio-Cortez were to say today that she’s a Smithian, but yet advocate for things she advocates, she’s trying to have a cake and eat it too."" - Cato Institute's Jeffrey Miron

But as Ocasio-Cortez was embracing her pro-capitalist views during her university years, signs of moving to the left became apparent as well. In an article about her getting malaria while studying abroad in Niger, she celebrated the cheap cost of malaria medication in the African country, suggesting Niger’s health care was superior to that of the U.S.

“In all, the blood test for malaria cost me USD$3 and the 10-day treatment was less than $10. Imagine that in a time where healthcare in the United States is at such a critical crossroads,” she wrote.

""The blood test for malaria cost me USD$3 and the 10-day treatment was less than $10. Imagine that in a time where healthcare in the United States is at such a critical crossroads."" - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

She also questioned the definition of poverty and suggested people are happy in Niger thanks to having no material belongings. “It is neither a result of resignation to poverty nor an acceptance of such as a fact of life,” she wrote, explaining why people in Niger appeared “happy” to her.

“On the contrary, it may be due to having little material distractions that communities here are better able to focus on true sources of contentment – such as each other’s presence. The warmth and familiarity of exchange among complete strangers is valued here,” she added, asking “Where is the line between having less and choosing less?”

The campaign for Ocasio-Cortez didn’t respond to Fox News’ questions on whether she still subscribes to the analyses of Adam Smith and if she would call herself a feminist.",politics
"New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, currently one of the leading lights of the Democrats’ left-wing, is on a tour of the West Coast -- but is notably avoiding meeting up with the region’s Hollywood elites.

Ocasio-Cortez, who represents the party’s democratic socialist wing, has visited homeless areas on Los Angeles’ Skid Row neighborhood, and has met with liberal activists.

But as she has held low-dollar fundraisers, she has not engaged in glitzy events with high-profile Democratic donors and Hollywood celebrities.

The move has already raised eyebrows, with The Hollywood Reporter asking: “Is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Too Far Left for Hollywood?”

The outlet reported that it reached out to a number of “political operatives” and “members of the industry’s donor class,” who all said they were not aware of any meetings with her -- while others weren’t aware she was in L.A.



She also reportedly didn’t reach out to L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti.



Instead she held an event with a $27-a-head fee, or $10 for students. The move is is line with her campaign -- which was not supported by the Democratic Party machine, did not receive significant funding, and still managed to upend expectations as she beat Democratic Party mainstay Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y.

While she has picked up the backing of some Hollywood celebrities, such as Susan Sarandon and Chelsea Handler, and has engaged in a whirlwind media tour, Ocasio-Cortez has so far held back from getting too close from the Democratic and Hollywood elites -- unlike other key Democratic figures like former President Barack Obama or 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who were both comfortable in such circles.

Even Sanders, with whom Ocasio-Cortez has allied, occasionally dabbled in the Hollywood fundraising circuit, despite promising not to raise money from millionaires and billionaires. In 2015 he was welcomed at a campaign fundraiser at the Hollywood home of real estate agent Syd Leibovitch -- where those who spent $2,700 or who raised $10,000 were invited to a ""pre-event reception.""

SOCIALIST CANDIDATE OCASIO-CORTEZ ONCE SAW HERSELF AS SMITHIAN CAPITALIST, VIEWED FEMINISM AS 'RELIC'



She has embraced far-left issues such as Medicare-for-all and calls to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE.) She represents a rising left-wing within the party that has only been growing since democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., made a surprisingly strong primary challenge against eventual 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.



But Ocasio-Cortez’s rapid ascension from unknown candidate to political celebrity has raised concerns from more mainstream Democrats about how her brand of hard-left democratic socialism will play outside of left-wing hubs of New York City and Los Angeles.



Joe Lieberman, who was the Democratic Party's candidate for vice president in 2000, in an interview with Fox News last month, said that Ocasio-Cortez’s ideas will struggle to gain support across America.

""When I see somebody who really says she's a socialist -- she's a very captivating, charismatic candidate -- when you look at those policies, those policies will not be supported in many places across America,"" Lieberman said.

Former President Barack Obama issued a lengthy list of midterm endorsements last week -- a list which notably did not include Ocasio-Cortez.

That nervousness is unlikely to have been soothed by recent media appearances. In a recent interview with “The Daily Show” she struggled to lay out how she’d fund her agenda -- that interview quickly went viral in delighted right-wing circles. She also got into trouble after she referred to Israel's ""occupation"" of Palestine, before admitting she was ""not the expert"" on the subject.

But in L.A., the enthusiasm for her only appears to be growing. The Hollywood Reporter reported that an event with Ocasio-Cortez quickly sold out with almost no marketing.

""She really inspires me, because she's so young and she's getting so far,"" said Melainey Jane Foerster, 16, a high-school student from suburban Santa Clarita, told The Associated Press.

“She’s new, she’s a fresh voice — and we’ve been lacking that,’’ Faith Eberling, a longtime San Francisco Democrat, told Politico.

"One of President Trump's most vocal critics in the U.S. Senate said Friday that he once cried “tears of rage” over the Trump administration’s rhetoric.

U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., made the remark at the Netroots Nation Conference in New Orleans, where other liberal speakers were to include U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

The annual convention drew thousands of liberal activists and offered a chance for Democrats considering presidential runs to win over supporters, the Washington Times reported.

“I’m a big believer that if America, if this country hasn’t broken your heart, then you don’t love her enough,"" Booker continued. ""Because there’s things that are savagely wrong in this country.”

“I’m a big believer that if America, if this country hasn’t broken your heart, then you don’t love her enough. Because there’s things that are savagely wrong in this country.” - U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.

One place where Booker claimed to have had his heart broken was Newark, N.J., the struggling Northeast city -- with poverty and crime rates typically among the nation's highest -- where Booker served as mayor from 2006 to 2013.

“Newark has gifted me a wisdom that can only come from wounds, a sense of purpose that can only come from shared pain,” Booker said, according to the Times. “It’s a city that at times where my heart has been broken but I’ve learned that the heart is this interesting organ that, it’s the only one that really works even if it’s gotten broken.”

“Newark has gifted me a wisdom that can only come from wounds, a sense of purpose that can only come from shared pain.” - U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.

Booker also lamented for a Democratic Party that, in his view, seems ""to have lost our way.""

“I think a lot about the Democratic Party nationally and how it seems that that connection to people — where they are, what their experiences are, their struggles, their hurts and their pain — how we seem to have lost our way,” he said.

Anti-Israel sign?

Booker's spokesman, Jeff Giertz, later found himself doing damage control because of a sign that the senator held up during a photo shoot with some attendees of the same New Orleans conference.

The attendees turned out to be activists from the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, a group that advocates for “anti-racism principles,” according to its website.

The sign Booker held said “From Palestine to Mexico, all the walls have got to go,” raising the eyebrows of pro-Israel supporters.

Giertz told the Washington Free Beacon that the senator didn’t have time to read the sign “amid the rush” and thought it was only talking about Mexico.

Giertz added that Booker does believe security barriers are necessary as long as ""active terrorist organizations threaten the safety of the people living in Israel.""

Last week, Booker implored activists to “please, get up in the face of some congresspeople,” at the National Conference on Ending Homelessness in Washington D.C., Fox News Insider previously reported.

He also joined senior members of Senate last week to oppose Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying “you are either complicit in the evil … or you are fighting against it,” Fox News Insider also previously reported.",politics
"The Newseum in Washington, D.C., is an interactive museum that celebrates the role and history of the media in America.

So, what are among the top-selling items in the museum's gift shop and through its online store? Red caps that say ""Make America Great Again,"" and T-shirts that say ""You Are Very Fake News.""

But the popularity of items associated with President Trump has been irritating many members of the media, Poynter.org, the website for a media think tank, reported.

“Your ‘fake news’ t-shirts aren’t funny, @Newseum(.) They make a mockery of the reporters, whose name you have inscribed on your walls, who died for their vocation,” reporter Leigh Giangreco tweeted.

The mission of Newseum, a nonprofit enterprise, is to “increase public understanding of the importance of a free press and the First Amendment,” according to its website.

As for sales of merchandise at the museum, Sonya Gavankar, a Newseum spokeswoman, told Poynter that ""the MAGA hat and the FBI hat are two of our best-selling items.”

She added that the merchandise offered for sale shows how the museum tries to foster an environment that encourages free expression.

“As a nonpartisan organization, people with differing viewpoints feel comfortable visiting the Newseum,"" she said, ""and one of our greatest strengths is that we’re champions not only of a free press but also of free speech.""

But a member of the White House press corps, on condition of anonymity, objected to the Newseum selling political merchandise, adding that “fake news” apparel was an “insult to journalists,” Poynter reported.

“I go to the Newseum a lot and actually saw these T-shirts previously,” the reporter told Poynter. “I remember commenting to my friend how inappropriate I thought it was to sell this anti-press material at a museum that celebrates our industry.

“'Fake news' is a phrase that undercuts our profession and the hard-working journalists who practice the craft,” the reporter continued. “Selling clothing that is blatantly anti-press further promotes hatred towards journalists.”

Another reporter Valerie Insinna, tweeted that she will no longer be visiting the museum.

“I won't be recommending it to visitors, and I will not be taking my family and friends there ever again,” she wrote.

Other Newseum visitors who object to the Trump-related merchandise might consider just buying a Republican or Democratic coffee mug. The Newseum has those, too.",politics
"At his rally in central Ohio on Saturday night, President Trump took aim at U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, criticizing the longtime member of the Senate Intelligence Committee for reportedly having a suspected Chinese spy on her staff in the past.

“The leader of the Russia investigation, Dianne Feinstein, had a Chinese spy as her driver for 20 years,” Trump said about California’s senior U.S. senator, the Washington Times reported. “And she’s leading the Russian ‘witch hunt.’ Isn’t that something? And then she says to me, ‘What did you know about this and that?’ Give me a break.”

“The leader of the Russia investigation, Dianne Feinstein, had a Chinese spy as her driver for 20 years. And she’s leading the Russian ‘witch hunt.’ Isn’t that something? And then she says to me, ‘What did you know about this and that?’ Give me a break.” - President Donald Trump, at a rally in Ohio on Saturday

The president’s remarks continued a feud that Trump had begun on Twitter on Friday night, when he reacted to reports of the Feinstein story.

“Dianne is the person leading our Nation on ‘Collusion’ with Russia (only done by Dems),” the president tweeted. “Will she now investigate herself?”

Feinstein retaliated with a pair of tweets Saturday.

“The FBI told me 5 years ago it had concerns that China was seeking to recruit an administrative member of my Calif staff (despite no access to sensitive information),” Feinstein wrote in the first message. “I took those concerns seriously, learned the facts and made sure the employee left my office immediately.

“Compare that to your actions: attacking the FBI and refusing the advice of your national security team. SAD! I appreciated then and now the diligent work of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies and acted in the best interests of the country. Give it a try!”

Earlier in the week, Politico and other outlets reported that Feinstein learned from the FBI about five years ago that a staffer in her San Francisco office was suspected of delivering political intelligence, though nothing top secret, to officials at the local Chinese Consulate.

Feinstein was said to have been “mortified” when she learned the news, according to Politico.

The FBI wasn’t able to charge the individual, but Feinstein “forced him to retire,” a source told the San Francisco Chronicle.

In Ohio, Trump used the Feinstein story as an example that other countries besides Russia are engaged in espionage against the United States.

“Not only China, it’s a lot of people,” Trump said, according to the Washington Times. “And we’ve got to stop it. We’ve got to stop meddling, we’ve got to stop everybody from attacking us. But there are a lot. Russia’s there, China’s there. We’re doing well with North Korea, but they’re probably there [spying]. We’ve got to stop everybody.

“And I like Dianne Feinstein. But I don’t like the fact that she had a Chinese spy driving her, and she didn’t know it.”

Earlier this year, Trump blasted “sneaky Dianne Feinstein” after the Democrat released the transcript of a congressional interview with the co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the anti-Trump dossier, claiming the move was “possibly” illegal.

“The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!” Trump tweeted in January.

Trump’s visit Saturday to Lewis Center, Ohio, was mostly about supporting state Sen. Troy Balderson, a Republican looking to win a special election for a U.S. House seat this coming Tuesday.

"President Trump on Tuesday commemorated Purple Heart Day, in which military members who have been injured or killed while serving the U.S. are recognized.

""Today, on the 236th anniversary of the Purple Heart, we honor the members of our Armed Forces for serving as the vanguard of American democracy and freedom around the world,"" the president said in a statement.

Purple Heart Day is celebrated annually on Aug. 7. The holiday was created by George Washington in 1782 — making it America's oldest observed holiday.

The Purple Heart is given to members of the U.S. Armed Forces who have been wounded or killed during battle or an act of terrorism, or those who died in captivity as prisoners of war.

Those who have received the honor are recognized as part of the ""Military Order of the Purple Heart,"" which was formed in 1932 ""for the protection and mutual interest of all who have received the decoration.""

Trump on Tuesday called the merit ""the most sacred, distinguished, and recognizable military medals.""

In numerous cities across the country, the state capitol buildings and other major landmarks will be bathed in purple light to commemorate the day.

"National Security Adviser John Bolton on Sunday suggested that former CIA Director John Brennan might have misused classified information, and that the ""unprecedented leaks"" from the administration may prompt broader changes in how security clearances are handled.

Bolton was in Israel for the first time as a Trump administration official to discuss national security issues with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials.

""Whether [Brennan] actually used classified information, I think people will be able to determine, but I think that's a serious problem,"" Bolton said. ""There is a line, and I think it's clear some people can cross it.

BRENNAN FLOATS SUING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION; OTHER EX-CIA OFFICIALS WEIGH IN DURING PARADE OF SUNDAY INTERVIEWS

""My opinion is that he was politicizing intelligence,"" Bolton added, saying Brennan had failed to keep intact the ""wall of separation between intelligence and policy.""

Host Martha Raddatz ultimately challenged Bolton: ""You’re not sure whether John Brennan used classified information? You have no specific examples.""

Bolton replied, ""I think a number of people have commented that [Brennan] couldn’t be in the position he’s in of criticizing President Trump and his so-called collusion with Russia unless he did use classified information. But I don’t know the specifics.""

President Trump revoked Brennan's security clearance on Wednesday, saying he had politicized his security clearance and misled Congress about CIA spying in the Senate.

A larger review of who can retain security clearances after leaving the federal government may be warranted, Bolton added.

TRUMP HITS BRENNAN AS POLITICAL 'HACK' WHO CANNOT BE TRUSTED

""I think it's certainly appropriate in a time of unprecedented leaks of classified info,"" Bolton said. ""I don't see that there would be anything wrong if it were determined to go that way to review the policies about former officials having clearances. Sometimes it can be useful.”

Brennan had publicly accused President Trump of ""treason"" after his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin this summer in Helsinki, Finland, and he has repeatedly lambasted Trump with Twitter posts that critics have charged improperly hint at classified insider information about the ongoing Russia probe.

On Sunday, Brennan claimed on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that ""I don’t believe I’m being political at all.""

He also suggested he might take legal action against the president.

""If my clearances and my reputation as I’m being pulled through the mud now -- if that’s the price we’re going to pay to prevent Donald Trump from doing this against other people, to me it’s a small price to pay,"" Brennan said. ""I’m going to do whatever I can personally to try to prevent these abuses in the future, and if it means going to court, I will do that.""

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, a critic of Trump's decision to revoke Brennan's clearance, acknowledged that Brennan's unfettered comments had become an ""issue.""

""John and his rhetoric have become an issue in and of itself,"" Clapper said Sunday. ""John is sort of like a freight train, and he's going to say what’s on his mind.""

On CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" however, former CIA Director Leon Panetta claimed Trump may not have had the legal authority to terminate Brennan's clearance unilaterally.

“I think there are questions raised as to whether or not this president has followed the executive order, and whether or not he’s provided due process to those that are going to have their security clearances revoked,” Panetta said, referring to Executive Order 12968. The order establishes procedures for revoking security clearances.



Asked in the wide-ranging ABC interview about the threat of cyber-warfare ahead of the November elections, Bolton said the administration is monitoring threats from a variety of countries other than Russia.

""I can say definitively that it's a sufficient national security concern about Chinese, Iranian, and North Korean meddling,"" Bolton told Raddatz. ""I'm not going to get into what I’ve seen or haven't seen, but I’m telling you, looking at 2018 election, we are concerned about four countries.""

But Bolton said he plans to press his counterpart in Russia on the country's alleged election meddling in a meeting on Thursday.

""We'll keep raising it, and see what their response is,"" Bolton said. ""But it's not a question of just speaking with Russians. At the president's direction, we had a briefing with myself and four heads of deptartments, to lay out in nonclassified environment, what we're doing. That includes both defensive and offensive cyber operations to protect integrity of election process.""

Bolton said his meetings would also touch on Afghanistan, North Korea, Syria, and the Iran nuclear deal, which President Trump pulled out of earlier this year, leading to unrest and further economic decline there.

Bolton also told Raddatz that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be returning to Pyongyang ""soon"" for a fourth visit to engage in direct talks with North Korean leader Kim Jung-un. The White House's timeline for denuclearization is one year, Bolton said.

And the national security adviser said it would ""ultimately be the president’s decision"" whether to replace U.S. troops in Afghanistan with private military contractors.",politics
"Top law enforcement officials have countered a claim by Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson that Russian operatives had penetrated some county election systems in his home state of Florida.

In a Monday letter obtained by Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and FBI Director Christopher Wray told Florida officials that while Russian spies “have previously demonstrated both the intent and capability to conduct malicious cyber operations,” there is no current evidence to suggest any meddling in the upcoming midterm elections in November.

“DHS and the FBI will continue to notify any victim of a successful cyber intrusion into their election network in any jurisdiction nationwide,” the letter, which was first reported by the Orlando Sentinel, stated.

The letter is the latest blow to Nelson's claims. It comes after Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner sent letters to the DHS, FBI and congressional leaders inquiring about the senator's assertions.

Nelson made the unsubstantiated claim earlier this month. He said Russian agents “have already penetrated certain counties in the state and they now have free rein to move about.” He added that voting machines in Florida have already been compromised by Russian meddling.

The senator’s claim drew quick retorts from a number of prominent Republicans, including Florida Gov. Rick Scott who is challenging Nelson for his Senate seat. Scott demanded that the three-term Democratic incumbent provide proof of his claim and raised the concern that Nelson may have revealed classified information.

""Until the essential question is answered – was Nelson revealing classified information or did he make this up – until that answer is clearly marked out by the senator, I think that these questions are not going away,"" Lauren Schenone, the press secretary for Scott's campaign, told The Hill.

Nelson, and fellow Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote to election officials back in July warning about potential threats to their state’s election apparatus. Nelson and Rubio suggested that 2018 would be a year that demands “greater awareness of cyber threats,” and encouraged state officials to take advantage of the “wide range of services” provided by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to safeguard against such intrusion.

Despite the criticism from Scott and other Republicans, Nelson has refused to back down from his comments.

During stops in north Florida over a two-day period last week, Nelson said state and local officials need to take Russian meddling as a ""serious threat"" and county election supervisors need to make sure they have help to protect their election systems. Russian hackers targeted at least 21 states, including Florida, during the last election.

""It would be foolish to think that the Russians are not continuing to do what they did in Florida in 2016,"" Nelson said. ""It is unfortunate that some Florida officials are trying to use this for partisan purposes.""

"A federal jury in Virginia convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on eight counts of bank and tax fraud, making him the first campaign associate of President Trump found guilty by a jury as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.

But after four days of deliberations, the jury told Judge T.S. Ellis III on Tuesday afternoon that it could not come to a decision on ten other counts related to financial crimes. A mistrial was declared on those counts.

“I feel very badly for Paul Manafort,” Trump told reporters Tuesday evening after landing in West Virginia for a political rally.

“It has nothing to do with Russian collusion,” Trump added, calling Mueller’s probe a “witch hunt.”

The jury began deliberating last Thursday after a three week trial where prosecutors said Manafort hid income earned from political work overseas from the IRS while fraudulently obtaining millions in bank loans. Manafort, 69, had pleaded not guilty to all 18 counts.

Manafort was stone-faced as the verdict was read. The government has until Aug. 29 to decide whether it will move to retry the 10 deadlocked counts.

Manafort is facing a maximum sentence of 80 years in prison.

Outside court, Manafort attorney Kevin Downing thanked the jurors for “their very long and hard-fought deliberation"" and said he believed his client got a fair trial.

“He is evaluating all of his options at this point,” Downing said of Manafort.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE PAUL MANAFORT CASE

Before the jury was dismissed, Ellis asked jurors if they wanted their names to remain confidential. All answered yes. The judge told them they were allowed to speak to the press if they chose.

In court, Ellis -- known for his colorful comments and reprimands of lawyers throughout the trial -- commended both sides of lawyers for their ""effective and zealous representation.”

Earlier Tuesday, the 12-member jury signaled difficulty reaching consensus when it sent Ellis a note.

""If we cannot come to consensus on a single count...what does that mean for the final verdict?"" they asked.

Ellis responded that this would not be “exceptional” and said the jury could reach a “partial verdict.”

Downing asked Ellis if he would tell the jury they have a third option – “hung jury” -- on each of these counts. The prosecution objected to that plan and Ellis agreed.

The whirlwind trial is the first to result from Mueller's ongoing investigation into Russian election meddling, although Manafort's prosecution does not relate to any election interference or alleged collusion by the Trump team with Russian officials.

While Trump lamented the guilty verdict, Democrats on Capitol Hill pounced.

“The conviction of Paul Manafort on multiple felony charges of bank and tax fraud marks a major turning point in the Special Counsel’s ongoing investigation, and shows again that the president’s campaign was populated by individuals with a history of unscrupulous and dishonest business dealings and concerning ties to overseas interests,” said California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

“He is evaluating all of his options at this point."" - Defense attorney Kevin Downing, on Manafort

As the jury entered its fourth day of deliberations, the defense expressed optimism that things were headed in their direction.

Manafort entered the courtroom earlier Tuesday morning looking upbeat. Manafort patted a couple of his lawyers on the shoulder and acknowledged his wife Kathleen, sitting in the front row, with a wink.

Defense attorneys rested their case without calling Manafort or any other witnesses to the stand. But attorneys for Manafort suggested that Mueller’s team had improperly ensnared their client in its probe, as the case did not have anything to do with Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

In closing arguments last week, the prosecution painted the former Trump campaign chairman as a chronic liar, telling jurors Manafort was “not above the law.”

The prosecution’s star witness, Rick Gates – Manafort’s former business partner who struck a plea deal to cooperate with the government -- testified during the trial that he and Manafort committed bank and tax fraud together.

Manafort’s legal troubles continue, whether or not prosecutors attempt to retry the deadlocked counts. He also faces charges in a separate federal court case in Washington, including conspiring against the United States, conspiring to launder money, failing to register as an agent of a foreign principal and providing false statements.

"As President Trump has traveled across the country this week, a number of spectators have been spotted holding up giant cutouts of the letter Q and wearing T-shirts with the hashtag, #WeAreQ.

So who are they?

Under the radar until now, they are members of the fringe, right-wing group QAnon which believes in massive conspiracies in the media and the so-called “deep state” to take down Trump.

The group “is just hitting the right audience at the right time given the right circumstance,” Joseph Uscinski, a University of Miami professor who co-authored the book “American Conspiracy Theories,” told The Associated Press. He said the topics appeal to many who are already inclined to believe conspiracy theories.

Read on for a look at what QAnon is, and why it’s been in the news lately.

What does the group believe?

There are several conspiracy theories this group has latched on to, especially the belief there is a network of people, including in the U.S. government, that wants to take down Trump and his administration, according to The New York Times.

Another theory, according to NPR, is that Special Counsel Robert Mueller isn’t actually investigating allegations of Russian interference and collusion in the 2016 election. Rather, the former FBI director is looking into prominent Democrats — including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, Trump’s 2016 opponent — and their relationship with Russia or potential connections to a massive (unsubstantiated) pedophile ring.

Another belief is the military asked Trump to run for president in order to deal with the nefarious group of people in government, according to NPR.

The group also has its own lingo. Aside from calling the leader simply ""Q,"" they refer to those who attempt to debunk the group and its theories as “clowns,” and those who follow along as “bakers.""

How did it get started?

According to The Associated Press, an anonymous person posted on the online messaging website 4chan in October 2017 claiming to have a high-level government security clearance — a ""Q clearance,"" to be exact — and discussed Trump, Obama, Clinton, political donor George Soros and others. The message was titled, “The Calm Before the Storm,” which many believe to be a reference to a meeting Trump had with military leaders earlier that month when he used the same phrase.

The poster, ""Q,"" leaves what are called “breadcrumbs,” or clues for followers to decipher to figure out the conspiracy theories.

It’s unclear who ""Q"" actually is, and if he or she is just one person or a group.

Why is it making headlines now?

People holding signs or wearing apparel referencing QAnon have started showing up at Trump rallies and other political events in recent months.

A group marched to the Department of Justice in protest in April 2018. And a 30-year-old man was arrested for alleged terrorist acts, among other things, after he blocked a highway near the Hoover Dam with his armored truck, calling for the release of a Justice Department report pertaining to Clinton’s email server, WTVR reported. The man involved in that June incident is believed to have been associated with QAnon.

Roseanne Barr, the embattled actress whose namesake show was canceled this year after she tweeted racist sentiments about a former Obama administration official, has also apparently retweeted messages from its Twitter account and asked to make contact with the leader.

In June, she also tweeted the phrase “wwg1wga,” which NPR translated as “where we go one, we go all,"" a common phrase among supporters.

Anything else to know about the group?

It looks for validation, especially in the number 17, which coincides with where Q is in the alphabet.

For example, the University of Alabama national champion football team gave Trump a jersey with the number 17 on it earlier this year when it visited the White House. As The New York Times reported, some who adhere to the Q group believe it’s a symbol that it exists; others online believe it shows Trump, himself, is ""Q.""

"Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., and his wife, Margaret, were indicted on charges of illegally converting $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses and filing false records, prosecutors announced Tuesday.

In response, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday evening that he would remove the congressman from all committee assignments for the time being, calling the charges against Hunter “deeply serious.”

Among the allegations named in the 48-page indictment included instances between 2009 and 2016 when Hunter and his wife used campaign funds to pay for family vacations to Italy and Hawaii, school tuition, dental work, and even domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives, according to a press release from the Southern District of California’s U.S. Attorney’s Office.

The indictment also alleged that the pair spent “tens of thousands of dollars” on items ranging from movie tickets, fast food, golf outings, groceries and home utilities.

Fox News obtained a letter sent from Hunter's attorney, Gregory A. Vega, to U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein on Aug. 6 asking him to postpone the indictment.

Vega contended that there was a ""rush to indict"" after a two-year grand jury investigation.

Vega asserted the prosecution was ""politically motivated"" because of Hunter's early support of Donald Trump for president. He also claimed bias from prosecutors in the Southern District of California who supported Hillary Clinton's candidacy.

The congressman's lawyers said in 2017 that Hunter and his wife repaid the campaign about $60,000.

Prosecutors said Hunter and his wife “mischaracterized” the purchases in Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings to hide the illicit spending.

“Family dental bills paid with campaign funds were characterized as a charitable contribution to ‘Smiles for Life,’” the press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office said as an example.

Charges included conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, wire fraud and falsifying records.

Hunter, one of Trump’s earliest supporters in the presidential race, allegedly was aware of what he and his wife were doing and continued to spend campaign funds on personal expenses despite multiple warnings from his campaign treasurer about “questionable purchases.”

“According to the indictment, the Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could be made only by using campaign funds, since they did not otherwise have sufficient personal funds to pay for their purchases,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

U.S. Attorney Adam Braverman said Tuesday’s indictment proved that “no one is above the law.”

The pair is due to be arraigned in court on Thursday morning.

"The arrest of a 24-year-old illegal immigrant in the murder of University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts sparked both mournful — and fiery — responses from politicians on Tuesday, as they pleaded with Congress to do more to protect U.S. citizens.

Investigators identified Tibbetts' suspected killer as Cristhian Bahena Rivera, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who is believed to have been living in the area around Brooklyn, Iowa, for four to seven years.

President Trump, while in West Virginia speaking at a rally, said Tibbetts' murder ""should have never happened.""

""You heard about today with the illegal alien coming in, very sadly, from Mexico and you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman?"" Trump asked. ""Should have never happened. Illegally in our country.""

Vice President Mike Pence said he was ""heartbroken"" by the news of Tibbetts' brutal slaying and offered prayers for the young woman's family and close friends ""in this time of unimaginable grief."" Pence called for ""justice"" after police announced Rivera's arrest.

""We commend the swift action by local, state, & federal investigators working in Iowa in apprehending an illegal immigrant, who’s now charged with first-degree murder. Now, justice will be served. We will never forget Mollie Tibbetts,"" Pence continued in a tweet.

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she expressed condolences to Tibbetts' family earlier Tuesday, declaring ""justice had just begun"" after the arrest of Rivera.

""As Iowans, we are heartbroken, and we are angry. We are angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community, and we will do all we can bring justice to Mollie’s killer,"" Reynolds, a Republican, added in a tweet.

""My heart hurts for Mollie’s family. Prayers. 💗,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley tweeted after Tibbetts' dad, Rob, confirmed the student's body had been found.

MOLLIE TIBBETTS, UNIVERSITY OF IOWA STUDENT FOUND DEAD: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS

Fred Hubbell, a Democratic nominee for Iowa governor, tweeted that the news was ""truly heartbreaking,"" adding that ""words today will be of little comfort"" to Tibbetts' loved ones.

""This is truly heartbreaking. For Mollie’s parents, her family and friends, any words today will be of little comfort,"" he tweeted. ""As a parent and grandparent, your worst nightmare is losing your child.""

He went on to praise authorities for their ""around the clock"" dedication to the investigation.

John Cox, a GOP candidate in California's race for governor, released a statement comparing Tibbetts' murder to the ""heartbreaking death"" of Kate Steinle, who was shot and killed on a San Francisco pier in 2015. Investigators said the suspect, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, was in the U.S. illegally. A jury acquitted him of murder, manslaughter and assault last year but convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

""As a father of four daughters, it crushes my heart to see yet another family go through this nightmare,"" Cox said. ""Those who want to abolish ICE need to consider the consequences of their rash proposal.""

He continued, ""The Mollie Tibbetts case is one more tragic example of a senseless loss that never should have happened, similar to Kate Steinle’s heartbreaking death in San Francisco.""

Texas Governor Greg Abbott pivoted to turn Tibbetts' death into a poltical discussion, partially placing blame on sanctuary cities, though Iowa — where the 20-year-old's body was found in a field covered with corn stalks — doesn't have any designated sanctuary cities.

""An undocumented immigrant is charged for murder of Mollie Tibbetts, the Iowa college student who went missing on July 18,"" Abbott, a Republican, tweeted. ""This is why so many Americans are angry about sanctuary cities. It’s why Texas banned sanctuary cities.""

House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., also called on members of Congress, specifically Democrats, to help push forward stricter immigration legistlation.

MOLLIE TIBBETTS MURDER SUSPECT ID'D AS CRISTHIAN RIVERA, 24, LIVING IN US ILLECALLY

""What will it take for Democrats to renounce their dangerous open borders policies and start to put American citizens first?"" Scalise asked. ""It’s time they stop blocking common sense bills to restore the rule of law in this country before we see another senseless tragedy like this.""

In a nod to recent comments from fellow Republicans, Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar called on Congress to help secure the border.

""Securing our border is about protecting our communities, families and children from dangerous criminal activity and violence that threatens their safety. #SecureOurBorder,"" Gosar wrote, in part.

Iowa Rep. Steve King also asked for justice to be served.

""Mollie Tibbetts, our hearts are broken. We all prayed for your safe return. May you now be with the Lord and your family one day find a peace,"" he added.

"Despite 10-year-low unemployment, California took advantage of loopholes in federal regulation to keep more than 800,000 federal welfare recipients from having to work.

This conclusion is based on the response of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to an application to waive SNAP's work requirements for 55 of California's 58 counties, issued to the state in July and recently obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

California's waiver, which will last until August of 2019, exempts more than 800,000 able-bodied, childless Californians from having to work while on SNAP. This in spite of the fact that California's unemployment rate—4.2 percent—is at its lowest level in at least 10 years.

About 42 million people nationwide receive federal welfare benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Some SNAP recipients—able-bodied adults without dependents, commonly called ""ABAWDs""—are required under law to work at least 20 hours a week, or spend equivalent time in education and training programs, in order to continue receiving SNAP benefits. If an ABAWD fails to meet these requirements for three months, they lose their benefits.

States can receive waivers, however, exempting ABAWDs from work requirements if the state faces certain conditions. ABAWDs can be exempted in a given county for either of two reasons: (1) if the unemployment rate in that county is higher than 10 percent or (2) if the average unemployment rate in the county over a given two-year period is 20 percent higher than the national unemployment rate in the same two-year period.",politics
"Left-wing Democrats have long said that implementing Democratic socialism is easier than conservatives claim. But according to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it’s a walk in the park.

The overnight Democratic superstar, who rose out of obscurity after beating Rep. Joe Crowley, D-NY, in June’s primary, has been widely mocked for a number of gaffes and misstatements she has made on a subsequent media and campaign tour.

That mockery looked set to continue this week after she took a leisurely stroll through Maine’s Acadia National Park, and declared it -- along with other benign Sunday stops -- an example of democratic socialism.

She cited not only her visit to the park, but also eating a breakfast sandwich at a cafe co-op, and “supporting worker-owned businesses.” She also added as a “bonus” that she spotted a Planned Parenthood branch “helping people, per usual.”

She posted a number of accompanying pictures -- including her relaxing under a bridge, and another of her smiling outside the aforementioned Planned Parenthood center.

But while worker-owned businesses may have a ring of “Workers of the World, Unite!” to them, Ocasio-Cortez took heat for what critics described as the common mistake of equating some things government-run to socialism.

“The National Park System is not socialism in action: It is a mix of public goods, like monuments, and government maintenance of park land, which is not an interruption of private economic activity or a usurpation of private property rights,” The Weekly Standard’s Chris Deaton wrote in a column.

Deaton added that ""contra Ocasio-Cortez, a fishing trip to Yellowstone is not a celebration of Marx and Engels.""

She was similarly knocked on Twitter, including by some users who noted that the billionaire Rockefeller family -- associated more with capitalism than socialism -- has ties to the park.

“Acadia National Park was created by private philanthropists who made land donations and paid for its design, John D. Rockefeller in particular,” one user tweeted. “Read the signs next time. “

Fact-checkers have been hitting Ocasio-Cortez hard for a number of misstatements on everything from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to healthcare. She has shrugged off the criticism.

OCASIO-CORTEZ CLAIMS HAVE FACT CHECKERS WORKING OVERTIME

Conservatives have delighted in attacking her both for her gaffes, and her left-wing worldview, which they say represents a new extreme direction for the Democratic Party.

"Even if a federal jury had not found Paul Manafort guilty of multiple counts of bank and tax fraud, he still would have been heading back to prison after the trial.

Manafort was found guilty of eight out of 18 counts related to bank and tax fraud on August 21 – almost exactly two years after he resigned from the Trump presidential campaign in a shroud of controversy. And the former Trump campaign chairman is slated to appear in a different courtroom in September to face additional charges that include conspiring against the U.S.

Manafort is the first campaign associate of Trump’s to have been found guilty by a jury as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

After the Aug. 21 guilty decision, Kevin Downing, Manafort’s attorney, said his client is “evaluating all of his options at this point.” Manafort faces a maximum of 80 years in jail; a sentencing date has not yet been set.

Read on for a look at what attorneys have to decide in the coming weeks and what could be next for Manafort.

Manafort’s choice

It’s entirely likely Manafort, at 69 years old, could spend the rest of his life in federal prison, especially if he’s found guilty in an upcoming trial in Washington, D.C.

It’s plausible Manafort could seek a reduction of prison time if he agrees to cooperate with Mueller’s team – and if he has any information that can be corroborated by investigators.

“I see Mueller continuing to squeeze [Manafort] if he sees value,” Ron Hosko, a former assistant director to the FBI, told Fox News.

Manafort’s team could also appeal the decision, but Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said he didn’t think that would be “fruitful” for him.

“It would be difficult to overturn since [the case] is so fact-specific,” Tobias told Fox News. “And I think the judge was pretty receptive to Manafort as opposed to the government so I don’t think the 4th Circuit is going to give Manafort much comfort if he does appeal.”

Mueller’s bump

The guilty verdicts certainly give a needed boost to Mueller’s team and its credibility, especially as Manafort is the first former Trump campaign associate to be found guilty by a jury in this investigation. Other Trump associates, such as Rick Gates and Michael Flynn, have accepted plea deals.

“I don’t think you can characterize this as anything other than substantiating what Mueller has done so far,” Tobias said. “This gives him more flexibility to finish up his investigation and move forward.”

“There’s much that’s under the surface of the Mueller iceberg.” - Ron Hosko, a former assistant director to the FBI

Mueller’s team could move to retry the 10 charges the jury could not decide on, but Tobias considered that to be unlikely given its success with the other eight charges.

Hosko said he didn’t expect Mueller’s team spent too much time celebrating the guilty verdicts, but instead forged ahead with its investigation.

“There’s much that’s under the surface of the Mueller iceberg,” Hosko said, adding that the verdict could be a “pivot point” for the team, from finding evidence of collusion with Russia to other wrongdoings.

“Look what he’s walked into: Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos, Rick Gates, Manafort, [Michael] Cohen. These are all people the president has surrounded himself with, and that alone is very troubling,” he added. “Maybe [Mueller] doesn’t find collusion, but criminality.

The Trump card

It is possible Trump could pardon Manafort, although he hasn’t signaled whether he would do so yet.

Trump has continuously expressed his dismay over the verdict. On Twitter, he said he feels “very badly” for his former campaign chairman and his “wonderful family.”

“’Justice’” took a 12-year-old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him, and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to ‘break’ – make up stories in order to get a ‘deal.’ Such respect for a brave man,” Trump said.

John Dowd, formerly one of Trump’s lawyers in the Russia investigation, reportedly discussed a potential pardon of Manafort last year.

Another trial in his future

Manafort has a second trial coming up in mid-September. That trial, set in D.C., involves allegations he acted as an unregistered foreign agent for Ukrainian interests and made false statements to the U.S. government.

He is also accused of witness tampering in that case. Manafort had been out on $10 million bail, but it was revoked in June. His lawyers have said he’s being held in solitary confinement.

Prosecutors in the second trial have said they have more than double the evidence for that case than they disclosed in the Virginia one.

Ellis the ""wild card""

The “wild card” in this case, Hosko said, is U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III. Throughout the trial, Ellis often derided the prosecution – even at one point suggesting an attorney was so discouraged he was crying.

“You don’t really care about Mr. Manafort,” Ellis charged during the preliminary hearing. “You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever.”

Hosko said it’s possible Ellis could ignore sentencing guidelines and give Manafort less prison time.

Hosko warned, though, that should Ellis ignore the guidelines, it could undercut any motivation Manafort might have to cooperate with Mueller’s team.

"During a visit to Texas on Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence rushed to the aid of a congressman’s wife, who had tripped while exiting the staircase of Air Force Two.

Pence, walking alongside Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, was walking away from the vice presidential plane when Culberson’s wife, Belinda, tripped on the ground, according to CBS News’ Mark Knoller.

Pence quickly rushed to Culberson’s side, once he realized she had fallen, and the two, along with her husband, appeared to briefly chat before the three moved forward.

The vice president visited Texas to tour the area nearly one year after Hurricane Harvey caused widespread damage in the state.

Pence, according to the Houston Chronicle, also traveled to Houston with Culberson to attend a fundraiser for the congressman, who’s running for reelection this year.",politics
"New York Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez portrays herself as ""a normal, working person,"" but one of her positions may have helped 150 people lose their jobs.

After enduring mockery for declaring Sunday that a walk in a national park was an example of democratic socialism, Ocasio-Cortez lamented Monday the shutting down of an iconic New York coffee shop that closed mostly due to a higher minimum wage – which Ocasio-Cortez supported.

“The restaurant I used to work at is closing its doors. I swung by today to say hi one last time, and kid around with friends like old times,” the congressional candidate reminisced on Twitter. “I’m a normal, working person who chose to run for office, because I believe we can have a better future.”

The Coffee Shop in Union Square, which became especially famous after regularly appearing on HBO’s “Sex and the City,” will close down this fall after nearly 28 years in business. Co-owner and President Charles Milite announced the decision to shut the doors to its 150 employees last month.

But unlike what Ocasio-Cortez wants you to believe about the closing down, it wasn’t the result of greedy capitalists trying to squeeze the workers, but rather government regulations that forced the company to go bust.

“The times have changed in our industry,” Milite told the New York Post last month. “The rents are very high and now the minimum wage is going up and we have a huge number of employees.”

SOCIALIST CANDIDATE OCASIO-CORTEZ ONCE SAW HERSELF AS SMITHIAN CAPITALIST, VIEWEED FAMINISM AS ‘RELIC’

Ocasio-Cortez, who rose to prominence after defeating top Democrat Joe Crowley in the party’s primary election in June, has campaigned on the issue of minimum wage, arguing for a $15 federal minimum wage, up from $7.25, insisting that it won’t have any negative consequences for businesses.

During her appearance on “The Daily Show” with Trevor Noah, Ocasio-Cortez was pressed whether her suggestion of $15 minimum wage wouldn’t tank the economy. She cited the example of Seattle, which voted four years ago to gradually increase the hourly minimum to $15 over several years.

Yet Seattle is a troubling case, as research from the University of Washington's School of Public Policy and Governance found that the higher minimum wage led to significant job declines and actually left the poorest worst off in the city, the Washington Post reported.

The study estimated that low-wage jobs in the city dropped by 9 percent since 2016 and “hourly wages in such jobs increased by around 3 percent.” As a result, the study said, the city’s average worker lost $125 a month thanks to the minimum wage hike.",politics
"History may not repeat itself. But it sure does rhyme.

The war in Iraq wasn’t going well in the fall of 2005 and early 2006. A federal grand jury indicted top White House aide Scooter Libby. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, faced an indictment and was forced to step aside from his leadership post. DeLay aides Tony Rudy and Michael Scanlon encountered criminal charges in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. So did Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio. Ney went to jail. Rep. Duke Cunningham, R-Calif., resigned and did time after pleading guilty to bribery and fraud charges.

But none of that quite sealed the deal for the rival party in the midterms.

Then, word surfaced on the final two days of September 2006, that Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., sent inappropriate text messages to male, teenage House pages. The Foley news erupted in the final hours of Congress trying to wrap up work in Washington and head home to campaign for the midterm elections.

Voters awarded Democrats both the House and Senate that November.

It’s unclear that if in November, we’ll will look back at Aug. 21 the same way we viewed the final days of September, some 12 years ago. But the potential is there.

In the span of three hours, a federal jury convicted former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to another set of charges. Then the feds indicted Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., R-Calif., and his wife Margaret Hunter on charges of using campaign funds for personal expenses.

After the Manafort and Cohen stories, one could almost frame the Hunter story in the category, “And in other news ...”

The charges against Hunter have nothing to do with what went down involving Manafort and Cohen. But it’s noteworthy that Hunter was one of President Trump’s earliest and most-enthusiastic supporters in 2015 and early 2016. This is back when there were only a few Republicans on Capitol Hill getting behind the president. Hunter was among them.

This wouldn’t be so interesting if it wasn’t for the fact that authorities also just arrested Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., on insider trading charges two weeks ago. Like Hunter, Collins was was one of the president’s other original congressional supporters. The Collins charges aren’t related in any way to Hunter and are in no way linked to anything with Manafort and Cohen.

But, as they did in 2006, people may just look at the chaos and pull the lever the other way.

Collins isn’t seeking re-election. That seat could now be in play because Republicans can’t pry him off the ballot.

Hunter’s attorney Gregory Vega wrote a letter to a favorite GOP whipping boy, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Vega argued that the Justice Department was “rushing to indict Congressman Hunter.” Vega asserted the indictment was “politically motivated” because of Hunter’s early endorsement of President Trump. As a result, Vega contends the indictment means “a solidly Republican district is being handed to a Democratic candidate.”

Hunter’s counsel wasn’t the only one talking Tuesday. So was Cohen’s attorney, Lanny Davis.

“Today he stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election,” said Davis of Cohen. “If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn't they be a crime for Donald Trump?”

Now, let’s step back for a moment.

Storms have churned around Trump for a long time. In 2016, Democrats and pundits thought there was no way he could win. He was course. There was the ""Access Hollywood"" tape. You name it. And yet Trump sits in the White House.

In other words, all of the customary issues that could imperil a lot of politicians don’t seem to affect Trump. His approval ratings have even been on the rise of late. There’s chatter about a Democratic “wave” this fall. But no one is really sure.

If we adopt the 2006 model, Republicans are probably toast. Democrats would claim the House -- by a lot -- and maybe even win the Senate. When Democrats earned control of the Senate in 2006, they did so by picking up six seats, marshaling a 51-49 edge. If Democrats have any chance of controlling the Senate this fall, they’ll do it by a seat or two at best.

But, history doesn’t necessarily repeat itself. So, be careful when suggesting that the events of Aug. 21 offer keen insight on the midterm elections.

Yes. Democrats may do great and pick up a bunch of House seats in Pennsylvania and California come November. But there are too many uncertainties about seats in play in Virginia, Texas, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Nevada and Minnesota.

A day like Aug. 21 may yield some clues to the midterms. But not everything.

Lots can still happen.

Somewhere, brewing out there, is an “October Surprise.” Some morsel of information which could tip the midterms one way or the other.

Consider the possibilities:

It’s hurricane season. The devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 contributed to the Republican downfall in 2006.

School is back in session or will be soon. The left organized after last winter’s shooting in Parkland, Fla. Another mass shooting just before midterms could influence voters in November.

The international stage is far from settled. Big issues percolate with Russia, Turkey, Iran, North Korea and Syria. No one can ever rule out an international crisis.

And you just never know what Trump may say or do.

“He'd better not talk about pardons for Michael Cohen or Paul Manafort tonight or any time in the future,” warned Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as the president headed to a campaign rally in West Virginia.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., argued that the “backlash” of pardon talk for Manafort or Cohen “would have Watergate written all over it.”

Still, this isn’t 2006. Or 1974, for that matter. The convergence of things that doomed the Republicans in 2006 may be immaterial this year.

But it sure does rhyme.

"Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team was one holdout juror away from winning a conviction against Paul Manafort on all 18 counts of bank and tax fraud, juror Paula Duncan told Fox News in an exclusive interview Wednesday.

“It was one person who kept the verdict from being guilty on all 18 counts,” Duncan, 52, said. She added that Mueller’s team of prosecutors often seemed bored, apparently catnapping during parts of the trial.

The identities of the jurors have been closely held, kept under seal by Judge T.S. Ellis III at Tuesday's conclusion of the high-profile trial.

But Duncan gave a behind-the-scenes account to Fox News on Wednesday, after the jury returned a guilty verdict against the former Trump campaign chairman on eight financial crime counts and deadlocked on 10 others.

Duncan described herself as an avid supporter of President Trump, but said she was moved by four full boxes of exhibits provided by Mueller’s team – though she was skeptical about prosecutors' motives in the financial crimes case.

“Certainly Mr. Manafort got caught breaking the law, but he wouldn’t have gotten caught if they weren’t after President Trump,” Duncan said of the special counsel’s case, which she separately described as a “witch hunt to try to find Russian collusion,” borrowing a phrase Trump has used in tweets more than 100 times.

“Something that went through my mind is, this should have been a tax audit,” Duncan said, sympathizing with the foundation of the Manafort defense team’s argument.

She described a tense and emotional four days of deliberations, which ultimately left one juror holding out. Behind closed doors, tempers flared at times, even though jurors never explicitly discussed Manafort’s close ties to Trump.

“It was a very emotionally charged jury room – there were some tears,” Duncan said about deliberations with a group of Virginians she didn’t feel included many “fellow Republicans.”

A political allegiance to the president also raised conflicted feelings in Duncan, but she said it ultimately didn’t change her decision about the former Trump campaign chairman.

“Finding Mr. Manafort guilty was hard for me. I wanted him to be innocent, I really wanted him to be innocent, but he wasn’t,” Duncan said. “That’s the part of a juror, you have to have due diligence and deliberate and look at the evidence and come up with an informed and intelligent decision, which I did.”

Duncan, a Missouri native and mother of two, showed Fox News her two notebooks with her juror number #0302 on the covers.

In the interview, Duncan also described how the special counsel’s prosecutors apparently had a hard time keeping their eyes open.

“A lot of times they looked bored, and other times they catnapped – at least two of them did,” Duncan said. “They seemed very relaxed, feet up on the table bars and they showed a little bit of almost disinterest to me, at times.”

The jury box was situated in a corner of the courtroom that gave them an unobstructed head-on view of the prosecutors and defense, while members of the media and the public viewed both parties from behind.

COULD MANAFORT COOPERATE WITH MUELLER'S TEAM? A LOOK AT HIS OPTIONS AFTER THE GUILTY VERDICT

Judge Ellis told jurors, including Duncan, that their names would remain sealed after the trial’s conclusion, because of dangerous threats he received during the proceedings.

But the verdict gave Duncan a license to share her story without fear.

“Had the verdict gone any other way, I might have been,” Duncan said.

MANAFORT CONVICTED ON BANK AND TAX FRAUD CHARGES

Her account of the deliberations is no longer a secret. And neither is the pro-Trump apparel she kept for a long drive to the federal courthouse in Alexandria every day.

“Every day when I drove, I had my Make America Great Again hat in the backseat,” said Duncan, who said she plans to vote for Trump again in 2020. “Just as a reminder.”

"Yes, it's true, neither of the bombshell convictions that rocked the media and political world within minutes has anything to do with Russian collusion.

But the Michael Cohen guilty plea, as well as the Paul Manafort jury verdict, has huge political implications for President Trump that will play out over the coming weeks and months.

Let's cut through the spin. In much of the media, Tuesday's developments in courtrooms in New York and Virginia are getting the Watergate treatment, with lots of speculative pieces about impeachment (which Democratic leaders have said they're not pursuing). ""Legal Blows Fuel Impeachment Fears,"" blared Politico.

There is little doubt that many journalists are reveling in the convictions as vindicating their dark view of Trump.

At the same time, in media precincts friendly to the president, there is plenty of deflection and minimization. A campaign finance violation – which Cohen admitted in saying Trump had directed him to help buy the silence of Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal – is little more than a speeding ticket. No one in the Real America cares about Trump's involvement with a porn star and a Playboy model. And what about Hillary?

But neither the positive nor negative media chatter can obscure the fact that the dual events were a very tough development for the president. As The Washington Post’s Dan Balz put it, ""No day during President Trump's 19 months in office could prove as dangerous or debilitating as Tuesday.""

What was telling in the first 24 hours was that the White House didn't send anyone to the television studios to defend the president. Rudy Giuliani put out a statement, talked to a reporter or two, and that was it.

Lanny Davis, meanwhile, has been on a television blitz, saying that Cohen, his client, is telling the truth and has far more stuff to tell prosecutors if they are interested. Davis said the president's former attorney is raising money on a GoFundMe site and wouldn't accept a pardon from ""a dangerous person in the Oval Office.""

It fell to the president to defend himself on Twitter. He said he felt badly for the ""brave"" Manafort who, ""unlike Michael Cohen ... refused to 'break' — make up stories in order to get a 'deal.'""

And in a taped interview with Ainsley Earhardt of ""Fox & Friends"" airing today, Trump said he only knew about Cohen's hush money payments ""later on,"" which contradicts the lawyer's account.

Trump also contended that Cohen pled guilty to two campaign finance violations that ""are not a crime."" (Prosecutors obviously disagree.) He noted that an Obama campaign violation was ""easily settled."" In 2013, Barack Obama’s campaign and the DNC paid a $375,000 fine for a missing a series of required notices in the election's last 20 days involving donations of more than $1.8 million.

Look, this is not the rantings of Omarosa. For months, every time I wrote or spoke about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels or the $150,000 payment (through American Media Inc.) to Karen McDougal, I took plenty of heat from viewers and readers who said no one cared about allegations of decade-old affairs involving a celebrity businessman. And that's largely true. But it was never about the gossip. I've watched enough investigations to know that the financial paper trail could cause legal problems for the president and those around him.

Yes, this is far afield from Bob Mueller's mandate to investigate possible Russian collusion. But Ken Starr began with the Whitewater land deal and wound up with Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill Clinton's impeachment. Sarah Huckabee Sanders called impeachment talk a ""sad attempt"" by the Democrats, but in truth there hasn't been much of it.

No matter how the partisans and the pundits try to spin it, there are some difficult days ahead for the Trump presidency.",politics
"President Trump, in an exclusive interview with Fox News' Ainsley Earhardt, warned that the “market would crash” if he's ever impeached while questioning why Democrats would even consider that course in the future.

“I don’t know how you can impeach somebody who’s done a great job,” Trump said, in the interview which aired Thursday on ""Fox & Friends.""

The president weighed in on calls from the left to pursue impeachment if Democrats seize the House in the midterms. That speculation kicked up following the plea deal struck by his former attorney Michael Cohen claiming the president was involved in hush-money payments and admitting campaign finance violations related to them.

The president argued that he's done a great job in office, despite the critical coverage in connection with the Cohen case and other controversies.

Further, he warned, “If I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, I think everybody would be very poor, because without this thinking, you would see—you would see numbers that you wouldn’t believe in reverse.”

The president touted his economic accomplishments, claiming that the economy was going to be “down” if he hadn’t been elected.

“I freed up, I got rid of regulations, the tax cut was a tremendous thing,” Trump said. “But even before the tax cut, right from the first day, I got rid of regulations. I approved the pipelines, 48,000 jobs. But I did a lot of things.”

He added: “Had Hillary and the Democrats gotten in, had she been president, you would have had negative growth. We picked up $10 trillion worth.”

Impeachment talk is still confined to certain corners of the Democratic Party. Top House Democrats have largely pushed back on calls to pursue that option, though some have kept the door open.

The president also hit on immigration—saying “we’re doing a record-breaking job, but we have bad laws.”

“You know when you have bad laws you can do good. But you can do a lot better if you had good laws. So they’ll all get changed, but we have to elect more Republicans,” Trump said.

The president was asked about the murder of 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts, whom he called “a beautiful young girl.”

“She was killed by a horrible person that came in from Mexico, illegally here. Found by ICE, our great ICE who’s abused by the Democrats and the left. And without them, you might not be sitting here so comfortably right now. I just think it’s so sad,” Trump said.

Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, in the U.S. illegally from Mexico, was charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday in Tibbetts’ death. He is currently being held on a federal immigration detainer.

“We’re building the wall. It’s already started. We’ve spent $3.2 billion on it. We’re asking for $5 billion for this year’s funding. The wall is going up. A lot of people don’t know it,” Trump said.

He added that he would “like to build it even faster,” but said working with the Democrats is “very tough.”

“We’re doing an incredible job,” Trump said.",politics
"President Donald Trump on Wednesday urged his supporters to sign a petition to pressure ESPN to show the national anthem during “Monday Night Football” broadcasts.

In an email sent on behalf of the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, Trump called the network’s announcement last week a “spineless surrender to the politically correct liberal mob.”

“Just after we heard a slitting governor trash America, ESPN has now decided it will no longer play the National Anthem before Monday Night Football,” the email read. “If ‘America’ is too offensive for anyone in our country, then what are they doing in America?’”

The email appears to reference New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s remark earlier this month during a bill signing, in which he declared, “We’re not going to make America great again. It was never that great.”

A spokesperson for Cuomo walked back the comments shortly after, saying “the Governor believes America is great and that her full greatness will be fully realized when every man, woman, and child has full equality.”

The Trump email concluded by saying, “I was the first person to sign this petition. Now I need you to follow my lead and be the second.”

Speaking to reporters during ESPN’s annual football media day, Jimmy Pitaro, the network’s president, said the national anthem would not be showed, before acknowledging, “there could be changes.”

“It’s somewhat unpredictable what’s going to happen in the world but as of now our plan now is to not broadcast the anthem. We have communicated that back to the NFL,” Pitaro said. “They have not asked but we proactively just as a courtesy and as good partners let them know what our plans are.”

Trump, who has been at the center of the national anthem controversy since former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the 2016-17 NFL season in opposition to police brutality, used his time on stage Tuesday night at a rally in West Virginia to condemn ESPN’s decision as “terrible.”

""While the players are kneeling ... you're all proudly standing for our national anthem,"" Trump told the crowd.

The NFL announced in May that teams and league personnel who do not “stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem” would be fined. However, the policy was put on hold as the league and its players association negotiated the strategy.

ESPN did not air the national anthem during last season’s ""Monday Night Football"" broadcasts, a similar approach that CBS has taken in the past and plans to do so this season, according to the USA Today Sports. FOX plans to only show the anthem during “special broadcasts” such as Veteran’s Day or Thanksgiving and during the playoffs, while NBC Sports broadcasts plans are still undetermined.

"President Trump blasted his former attorney, Michael Cohen, for “flipping” on him and praised another ex-lieutenant with legal trouble, Paul Manafort, in an exclusive “Fox & Friends” interview with Ainsely Earhardt airing Thursday morning.

The sit-down comes during a dizzying week that saw Cohen plead guilty and Manafort get convicted for crimes that mostly had to do with their personal business dealings. But Cohen also admitted making hush money payments on behalf of Trump in what prosecutors say amounted to campaign violations.

“[Cohen] makes a better deal when he uses me, like everybody else,” Trump said. “And one of the reasons I respect Paul Manafort so much is he went through that trial—you know they make up stories. People make up stories. This whole thing about flipping, they call it, I know all about flipping.”

He continued: “For 30, 40 years I’ve been watching flippers. Everything’s wonderful and then they get 10 years in jail and they—they flip on whoever the next highest one is, or as high as you can go.”

Cohen, Trump's former longtime personal attorney and self-described “fixer,” pleaded guilty Tuesday to five counts of tax evasion, one count of bank fraud, one count linked to an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count stemming from an illegal campaign contribution. The tax and fraud charges were tied to his dealings with a taxi business, while the campaign finance charges related to arranging payments to adult film star Storm Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal “at the direction” of then-candidate Trump.

Cohen is facing up to 65 years in prison on all the counts, but prosecutors have pledged to reduce his sentence sharply as part of the plea deal.

“It almost ought to be outlawed. It’s not fair. Because if somebody’s going to give—spend five years like Michael Cohen, or 10 years, or 15 years in jail because of a taxi cab industry, because he defrauded some bank—the last two were tiny ones,” Trump explained. “You know, campaign violations are considered not a big deal, frankly. But if somebody defrauded a bank and he’s going to get 10 years in jail or 20 years in jail, but if you can say something bad about Donald Trump and you’ll go down to two or three years, which is the deal he made.”

Trump said that “in all fairness” to Cohen, “most people are going to do that.”

“I’ve seen it many times,” Trump said. “I’ve had many friends involved in this stuff. It’s called flipping and it almost ought to be illegal.”

He laid out a scenario in which “you get 10 years in jail, but if you say bad things about somebody in other words, make up stories if you don’t know. Make up. They just make up lies. I’ve seen it many times.”

“They make up things and now they go from 10 years to they’re a national hero. They have a statue erected in their honor. It’s not a fair thing, but that’s why [Cohen] did it,” Trump said.

Trump also seemingly distanced himself from Cohen, downplaying a relationship which spanned over a decade.

“He was a lawyer for me, one of many,"" Trump said. ""You know, they always say, 'the lawyer,' and then they like to add 'the fixer.'” Well, I don’t know if he was a 'fixer.' I don’t know where that term came from. But he’s been a lawyer for me. Didn’t do big deals, did small deals. Not somebody that was with me that much.”

He added: “You know, they make it sound like I didn’t live with—without him. I understood Michael Cohen very well. He—well, it turned out he wasn’t a very good lawyer, frankly.”

Trump said that Cohen worked for him for about 10 years, and he would “see him sometimes,” but noted that while Cohen was involved in big deals, Trump had “outside lawyers” and “inside lawyers, too.”

“I always found him to be a nice guy,” Trump said.

At issue involving the president is the $130,000 payment to Daniels in the weeks prior to the 2016 presidential election in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump, as well as the McDougal case. McDougal was paid $150,000 by the parent company of the National Enquirer for her, separate, story about an alleged 2006 affair with Trump, which it never published. Cohen admitted Tuesday to making an excessive campaign contribution and causing an unlawful corporate contribution.

But Trump insisted he only knew about hush-money payments made by Cohen “later on,” despite Cohen’s claims to the contrary.

“Later on I knew. Later on. What he did –and they weren’t taken out of the campaign finance, that’s the big thing. That’s a much bigger thing,” Trump said. “Did they come out of the campaign? They didn’t come out of the campaign, they came from me.”

He added: “In fact, my first question when I heard about it was, did they come out of the campaign, because that could be a little dicey. And they didn’t come out of the campaign and that’s big. But they weren’t…that’s not even a campaign violation.”

“If you look at President Obama, he had a massive campaign violation but he had a different attorney general and they viewed it a lot differently,” Trump said. Trump was referring to Obama's 2008 campaign being fined $375,000 by the Federal Election Commission for a series of missing notices for more than 1,300 contributions. They totaled $1.8 million.

Trump, though, went on to criticize Attorney General Jeff Sessions, saying he “never took control of the Justice Department."" When asked whether he would fire Sessions or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he maintained that he wants to “stay uninvolved” with the DOJ.

“Jeff Sessions recused himself, which he shouldn’t have done. Or he should have told me,” Trump said. “Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you wouldn’t have put him in. He took the job and then he said I’m going to recuse myself. I said, ‘what kind of man is this?’”

Trump added that the “only reason” he appointed him as attorney general was “because I felt loyalty.”

“He was an original supporter. He was on the campaign. He knows there was no collusion,” Trump said. “And what’s come out of Manafort? No collusion. What’s come out of Michael Cohen? No collusion.”

This week, Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, was charged on eight counts of tax fraud as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Unlike Cohen, Trump noted in the exclusive interview with “Fox & Friends,” Manafort did not ‘flip.’

""I have great respect for what he's done in terms of what he's going through. You know, he worked for Ronald Reagan for years. He worked for Bob Dole. He worked, I guess his firm worked, for [Sen. John] McCain. He worked for many, many people many, many years, and I would say what he did, some of the charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does,"" Trump said.

He added: ""If you look at Hillary Clinton's person, you take a look at the people that work for Hillary Clinton, and look at the crimes that Clinton did with the emails and she deletes 33,000 emails after she gets a subpoena from Congress, and this Justice Department does nothing about it and all of the other crimes that they've done.""

Trump said he ""didn't know Manafort well,"" and that his charges were ""on things totally unrelated to the campaign.""

""And by the way, they got Cohen on [charges] totally unrelated to the campaign,"" Trump explained. ""I'm not involved. I wasn't charged with anything. You know, people don't like to say that, but I wasn't charged.""",politics
"The National Enquirer kept a safe of documents related to hush-money payments and other potentially damaging stories about then-candidate Donald Trump, according to a report.

The Associated Press, citing people familiar with the Enquirer’s parent company, American Media Inc., reported Thursday that the safe was “a great source of power” for publisher David Pecker -- who, in addition to so-called catch-and-kill deals with Trump, would also obtain exclusive rights to embarrassing stories about other people, including celebrities.

Pecker would buy the rights to the stories with no intention to publish, but instead use them to get in the subject’s good graces and acquire favors, according to the AP.

“It’s ‘I did this for you,’ now what can you do for me,” Jerry George, a former Enquirer reporter told the AP. “They always got something in return.”

Over fears of liability, the alleged documents were reportedly removed from the safe by Pecker, and the company’s chief content officer, Dylan Howard, leading up to Trump’s inauguration following a Wall Street Journal report about a catch-and-kill involving McDougal, the AP reported, citing a person directly faimilar with the events.

What exactly happened to the documents was unclear.

The Enquirer was allegedly involved in hush-money deals with Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen involving porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal to shut down allegations of affairs with the Trump.

Sources confirmed to Fox News on Thursday that Pecker struck an immunity deal with federal prosecutors in New York in exchange for information in the investigation into hush-money payments by Cohen.

Trump has repeatedly denied the affairs. He told Fox News on Wednesday that he wasn’t aware of the payments made by Cohen until “later on,” while maintaining they were not campaign funds.

“Later on I knew. Later on. What he did — and they weren’t taken out of the campaign finance, that’s the big thing. That’s a much bigger thing,” Trump said Wednesday. “Did they come out of the campaign? They didn’t come out of the campaign, they came from me.""

Previously in April, Trump said he did not know about the Daniels payment. Last month, an audio conversation between Trump and Cohen was obtained by CNN that discussed purchasing the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal’s story of her 2006 affair with Trump.

Vanity Fair first reported the immunity deal.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Pecker, who like Cohen was close with Trump, provided information on Cohen and the president in the criminal probe.

Cohen plead guilty to eight counts Tuesday, including campaign finance violations connected to the hush money payments “at the direction” of then-candidate Trump.

Former Enquirer employees told the AP that Trump stories, dating back more than a decade, were killed on arrival.

According to the AP, Cohen began pushing the Enquirer in 2010 to promote the idea of a potential Trump presidency, and was involved with the outlet’s decision to start questioning President Barack Obama’s birthplace.

"WASHINGTON— Nancy Pelosi is the chief villain of Republican campaign ads. The leader some Democrats promise to vote against. The subject of much speculation that her grip on power is coming to an end.

Nevertheless, she says she’s not going anywhere — and certainly not while President Donald Trump is in the White House.

“This is not anything to make a big fuss over, it’s politics,” Pelosi said in a 35-minute phone interview with The Associated Press. “I can take the heat and that’s why I stay in the kitchen.”

Pushing back on those who say her leadership position is in jeopardy, Pelosi all but dared her doubters to envision any other House Democrat sitting across the table to negotiate with Trump.

“I have a following in the country that’s unsurpassed by anybody, unless they’re running for president,” Pelosi said.

Trump and the Republicans are eager to see her go, she said, “and I’m just not going to let them do that.”

With Democrats bullish about winning back the House majority, Pelosi is already beginning to lay out a detailed early-days agenda that could be set in motion come January. Beyond cleaning up corruption, lowering health care costs and providing bigger paychecks, Pelosi told AP the Democrats would push forward legislation on background checks for gun purchases and legal status for young immigrants brought to this country illegally, often referred to as “Dreamers.”

“We’re ready,” she said.

Yet Pelosi’s return to the speakership, if Democrats triumph, is far from assured.

Dozens of Democrats — candidates and a few lawmakers — are saying they may not back her, creating an unprecedented groundswell for new leadership.

“I think we’re in different territory now,” said Rep. Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who won about one-third of the Democrats during a private caucus vote when he mounted a symbolic challenge against Pelosi two years ago. “It’s time to turn the page.”

But Pelosi has faced uprisings from the ranks before, most notably after Democrats lost control of the House after the tea party Republican wave of 2010. Anyone who is counting her out — and many are trying to show her to the exits— may be underestimating her staying power.

“It’s immodest of me to say, but I say to women now, ‘Just go for it.’ Tell them why you think you’re the best person to do this job,” she said. “I want to be an example to them, just to say, ‘Don’t run away from a fight.’ If you think you’re the one that should be there, you make the fight.”

It’s not that other Democrats haven’t tried to replace her. Pelosi’s top lieutenant, Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, has long coveted the top job, waiting out Pelosi for his moment to hold the gavel. He has been promoting himself to colleagues as a “bridge” to the next generation of leadership.

Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn of South Carolina let it be known recently that he, too, is willing to take the helm if Pelosi falls short, lawmakers said. That prospect is appealing to many Democrats, as he would be the first African-American speaker.

And younger lawmakers, including the 45-year-old Ryan, have not shut the door on running. Some say it’s time for a clean sweep, and that replacing 78-year-old Pelosi with 79-year-old Hoyer or 78-year-old Clyburn is not the generational change that the Democratic caucus wants.

“A lot of new people have come in and said, ‘Look, do I have to be here 30 years before I insert myself into the leadership group?’ ” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., who sees Clyburn’s potential bid as particularly influential in putting votes from the Congressional Black Caucus in play. The chairman of the CBC, Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., is likely to support Clyburn if he runs for speaker.

The complaints against Pelosi do not necessarily stem from her firm grip on the caucus — she is known for being direct with lawmakers, using what she has called her “mother-of-five voice.” But her long tenure has left little room for up-and-comers, and her visibility has become a liability for some Democrats.

Republicans have poured millions into vilifying Pelosi in ads, some $13 million so far this election cycle, and the House GOP’s campaign arm says Pelosi provides “a top argument” for electing more Republicans.

As more and more Democratic candidates and lawmakers stare down campaign ads linking them to Pelosi, some are pledging to vote against her. When the cameras turn on them during the speaker vote once the new Congress convenes in January, it’s hard to see how some of them will be able to belt out the name, “Pelosi.”

Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., a vocal proponent for new leadership, envisions more of a changing of the guard than an insurrection. “I didn’t say you grab the torch out of their hands and kick them down the stairs,” she said in an interview.

The missing piece in the furious behind-the-scenes chatter over Pelosi’s future is an obvious successor. Several leaders-in-waiting having moved on, and one lawmaker who had been seen as a possible replacement, Rep. Joe Crowley, recently lost his New York primary to newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

“There can’t be a race when no one has declared their candidacy,” said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who joined Pelosi for a “Moms’ Summit” in her Houston district this month that drew 600 people. Some of them lined up for the chance to snap selfies with Pelosi. “She was not an unhappy camper; she was a happy camper.”

Democrats are loath to start the new Congress in January with a floor fight over the speakership if they are newly in power.

And many Democrats say that, with an unprecedented number of women are running for office, “it would be very unceremonial to have the first woman speaker of the House win back the house — to lead us to victory — and then not to have her be speaker,” said first-term Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.

“If we win the House, I think Nancy stays, but there’ll be a transition at some point,” the Silicon Valley congressman said.

Pelosi acknowledges she will not lead House Democrats forever and that if she retakes the gavel it will be as part of a transition to a next generation of leadership.

Two years ago she was prepared to retire if Hillary Clinton was in the White House. But once Trump won, she felt compelled to stay — “a four-year extension,” as she puts it — to protect the Affordable Care Act, banking reform and the party’s other accomplishments.

“We think the fate of the nation is at stake,” she said.",politics
"A California Democrat who resigned last year amid sexual misconduct allegations -- including that he allegedly masturbated in front of a female lobbyist -- has transferred more than $1 million into a lieutenant governor committee account, according to a campaign finance report filed Tuesday.

The filing suggests that former state Assemblyman Matt Dababneh, 37, a Democrat who represented Woodland Hills, could be plotting a political comeback, the Sacramento Bee reported.

Dababneh stepped down last December after being accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. He denied the allegation and said at the time that he wanted to focus on clearing his name, the paper reported.

Lobbyist Pamela Lopez has accused Dababneh of pushing her into a hotel restroom in Las Vegas and masturbating in front of her, the report said.

Another woman, Jessica Yas Barker, said in December that she quit her job at a congressman's office because of Dababneh's frequent comments about her appearance, including advice that she not dress like ""such a lesbian,"" the Bee reported.

Dababneh resigned with nearly $1.2 million in the bank for his reelection effort, and put $1.06 million into his lieutenant governor campaign account by the end of March, the Bee reported.

A “Matt Dababneh for Lieutenant Governor 2022” committee was filed in March with the California secretary of state, helping to keep his campaign cash available, the Los Angeles Times reported in April.

Lopez has said Dababneh should instead donate the money to trauma and rape crisis centers to “atone for his actions,” according to the paper.

Dababneh reported spending more than $31,000 for lawyers; $11,828 for credit card payments; $8,430 for candidate travel; and $10,000 for a donation to the Hope of the Valley Rescue Mission, among other expenses, the Bee reported.

Dababneh did not immediately respond for comment.",politics
"New York Socialist Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez once blamed ride-sharing giant Uber for leading a yellow cab driver to suicide. Her campaign then took $4,000 worth of Uber rides.

But Ocasio-Cortez, who rose to prominence after defeating top Democrat Joe Crowley in the party’s U.S. House primary in June, is no fan of Uber, if you read her statements on social media.

She frequently criticized the ride-hailing company for what she sees as underpaying its drivers, decrying their pay as “exploitation” if they don’t get at least $15 an hour, the so-called living wage.

She directly blamed the company for the suicide death of Doug Schifter, a driver in his 60s, who killed himself with a shotgun amid financial difficulties caused by flooding the streets of New York with alternative and cheaper options of taxis, as detailed in a lengthy Facebook post.

“NYC's fourth driver suicide. Yellow cab drivers are in financial ruin due to the unregulated expansion of Uber. What was a living wage job now pays under minimum,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote.

That was in March, months before the New York socialist, who recently lamented the closing down of a coffee shop over minimum wage hikes that she supports, became the new face of the progressive Democratic Party.

But between April and late June, the Ocasio-Cortez campaign recorded spending nearly $4,000 on Uber for what appears to be 160 rides by its staff, Federal Election Commission (FEC) records reveal.

The payments to Uber ranged from just 59 cents to $82.26 and were filed under “car service.” All the rides were taken in California. There’s no data yet for the months of July and August.

In her home state of New York, Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign doesn’t use the traditional yellow cabs for getting around either.

The FEC records show that the campaign spent nearly $2,500 for more than 90 rides with the so-called ride-sharing startup company Juno that pitched itself as an alternative to Uber for drivers as it offered slightly better pay and an option to accumulate the company’s stock. There’s no data yet for any rides taken by the Ocasio-Cortez campaign between in July and August.

But the “driver-friendly” startup is barely any better for drivers than other ride-sharing companies. It was sold in April to Israel-based Gett for $200 million and immediately came under fire for scrapping the stock unit program for its drivers.

This prompted a class action by Juno drivers. “Plaintiffs were victims of the classic ‘bait and switch’ scheme – promised equity and then paid off at pennies on the dollar when all other shareholders/investors made out handsomely,” the suit reads.

The Ocasio-Cortez campaign didn’t immediately respond to Fox News’ questions about why the campaign doesn’t use traditional yellow cabs in New York or California, and whether it will stop using ride-hailing applications such as Uber or Juno.",politics
"The Manhattan district attorney’s office in New York City may push for criminal charges against the Trump Organization and two senior officials at the company over hush money that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen paid to an adult-film actress, according to a report.

Investigators led by District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. would look at how the company accounted for its reimbursement to Cohen for the $130,000 he paid to Stormy Daniels, who claims to have had an affair with President Trump, the New York Times reported.

Two officials with knowledge of the matter told the Times that the possible action was still in its early stages and no decision has been made on whether the state investigators will go after the Trump Organization.

The organization reportedly recorded the reimbursements to Cohen as a legal expense, but the former Trump attorney admitted Tuesday that he used the money to ensure the adult-film actress didn’t reveal the affair she allededly had with then-candidate Trump during the 2016 presidential election.

According to prosecutors, the reimbursement payments were phony legal invoices that were connected to a nonexistent retainer agreement. Cohen reportedly issued sham monthly invoices for $35,000 in “pursuant to retainer agreement.”

The former Trump attorney, who pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges, didn’t actually do any legal work concerning the issue.

“On its face, it certainly would be problematic,” one official familiar with the district attorney’s office review told the Times, adding that such reimbursement scheme could be considered a felony under state law.

Prosecutors in the district attorney’s office, who reviewed the court papers about the campaign finance charges and other federal crimes to which Cohen pleaded guilty, are now focused on determining whether business records were falsified, according to the Times.

If they were, this could lead to low-level felony or misdemeanor charges as it’s illegal to willfully make a false entry in a business record with intent to deceive. It’s a felony if the false record was made in an attempt to conceal or commit another crime.

But a state investigation is likely to face obstacles and delays due to other open inquiries related to Trump and his associates, including the federal investigation into Cohen, the probe by the special counsel Robert Mueller, and a lawsuit that the state attorney general brought against the Trump Foundation.",politics
"The Swedish student who was branded a “hero” and captured worldwide attention after she stopped the deportation of an Afghan migrant by refusing to sit down on a plane instead prevented the extradition of a man sentenced for assault and whose asylum application was rejected.

Elin Ersson, a student at Gothenburg University, was subjected to fawning media coverage over her stunt earlier this month when she refused to take her seat on the plane until the 52-year-old Afghan deportee was released. She was successful and authorities weren’t able to deport the man.

However, Swedish Police confirmed to Fox News that the man whose deportation Ersson prevented had received a prison sentence in Sweden for assault. The police spokesman declined to go into more details about the crime the migrant has committed. His asylum application was also rejected.

WOMAN REFUSES TO SIT DOWN ON FLIGHT IN EFFORT TO STOP MAN'S DEPORTATION TO AFGHANISTAN, DRAMATIC VIDEO SHOWS

A representative for Ersson declined Fox News’ request for a comment.

One of the largest newspapers in Finland, Helsingin Sanomat, reported last week as well that the man was sentenced for assault. The man will still eventually be deported, though the date remains unknown, the newspaper reported.

Despite lacking information about the man who was being deported, most media organizations jumped on the story, with the Washington Post calling Ersson’s stunt a “dramatic act of civil disobedience” while Newsweek magazine described the student as a “hero”.

CNN, meanwhile, spoke with Swedish authorities who confirmed that it was “forced deportation,” yet the outlet didn’t reveal why the man faced deportation.

The Swedish student live streamed the whole incident and it was viewed nearly 5 million times on Facebook alone. In the video, she’s heard saying “there is a man who is going to get deported to Afghanistan, where he will most likely get killed” and the she won’t “sit down until this person is off the plane.”

“I am doing what I can to save a person’s life,” she continues. “As long as a person is standing up, the pilot cannot take off. All I want to do is stop the deportation, and then I will comply with the rules here. This is all perfectly legal, and I have not committed a crime.”

An annoyed passenger tried to grab the phone from Ersson, saying she’s upsetting others. To which the student replied: “It's not my fault that he's getting deported. I'm trying to stop this.”

“I'm trying to change my country's rules. I don't like them. It's not right to send people to hell,” she added.",world

"An Aeromexico jet crashed after takeoff in the northern state of Durango, Mexico, on Tuesday.

No one was killed in the accident and all 103 people aboard Flight 2431 were found, Gov. José R. Aispuro said.

The governor added that 49 people had been hospitalized, noting that some passengers got out on their own, while other wandered back to the nearby airport.

""The most seriously injured is the pilot,"" Israel Solano Mejia, director of the Durango state civil defense office, told Foro TV. ""The majority of passengers left (the plane) under their own power.""

Aeromexico initially said 97 passengers and four crew members were aboard the plane, but the governor said there were actually 103 people on the plane and that two minors had not been included in the first tally.

The incident involved Flight 2431 aboard the Embraer 190 aircraft. Mejia said the plane ""made it off the ground, but fell nose-first.""

Aispuro said Tuesday that the airliner was hit by a wind gust as it left the runway just before it crashed.

According to FlightAware, the Aeromexico flight took off on time at 3:08 p.m. local time. It was headed to Mexico City, where it was scheduled to land at 4:38 p.m.

Officials and witnesses differ on whether the plane either fell shortly after takeover or ran off the runway without really gaining altitude. But they agree the plane was trying to take off during a storm.

"Israel carried out ""wide-scale"" airstrikes and deployed tanks against militant sites in Gaza killing four Palestinians on Friday after gunmen shot at soldiers near the border, officials said.

Israel's military said it struck eight Hamas positions after its soldiers came under fire. It later said ""fighter jets commenced a wide-scale attack against Hamas military targets throughout the Gaza Strip.""

The military has not commented on the condition of the soldiers shot but has described the attack as ""severe.""

It said ""Hamas chose to escalate the security situation and will bear the consequences for its actions.""The Gaza Health Ministry said four Palestinians were killed.

The militant Islamic Hamas that rules Gaza said three of the Palestinians killed were members of the group. Gaza media reported that gunmen had fired mortars toward the border.

Earlier Friday, Israel's Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman visited Sderot, an Israeli town near Gaza that has been hard hit by Palestinian rockets over the years. ""The heads of Hamas are forcibly leading us to a no choice situation in which we will need to embark on wide and painful military operation,"" Lieberman said.

On Saturday, Israel pounded Hamas targets in its largest bombardment campaign since the 2014 war, as Gaza militants fired dozens of rockets toward Israel.

Israel says it has no interest is engaging in another war with Hamas, but says it will no longer tolerate the Gaza militant campaign of daily flying incendiary kites and balloons across the border that have torched Israeli crops, burned nature reserves and killed wildlife.

Hamas on Friday vowed it will continue weekly protests and the launching of incendiary devices at Israel.

Khalil al-Hayya, a top Hamas leader, said ""the protests will remain, flaming and existing, and its tools will multiply and diversify, including kites, until our goals are achieved.""

For the first time, an incendiary balloon of the kind used in Gaza was found in the garden of southeast Jerusalem home close to the Palestinian town of Beit Jala. Police sappers dealt with the device.

The weekly protests led by Gaza's Hamas rulers against Israel are meant in part to draw attention to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after the militant group assumed control of Gaza in 2007.

The demonstrations have been fueled in large part by pervasive despair caused by the blockade which has caused widespread economic hardship.

Over 135, mostly unarmed, Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the border protests began on March 30.

Israel says it is defending its sovereign border and accuses Hamas, a group sworn to its destruction, of using the protests as cover for attempts to breach the border fence and attack civilians and soldiers.",world
"A 3-year-old girl from Iowa died after being ejected from a carnival ride in Mexico last Monday while on vacation with her family.

Jenessy ""Sophia"" Villalpando was on vacation in Penjamo, Mexico with her mother, grandfather and great-grandmother for the summer when she was ejected from her seat on a carnival ride, according to a GoFundMe page set up by family members.

Sophia's aunt, Marlene Chuautenago Villalpando said the ""tragic accident"" took place just a few days before the child was sent to go home.

"North Korea is possibly constructing new intercontinental ballistic missiles and moving on with “business as usual” for its missile program, an official told Fox News despite Kim Jong Un's claim to halt its weapon production and President Trump’s reassurance that the Hermit Kingdom is “no longer a nuclear threat.”

“It’s business as usual,” a U.S. official with knowledge of the latest intelligence assessment on North Korea told Fox News on Tuesday. The official specifically noted Kim’s regime is pushing forward with building ICBMs — the missiles that caused the North Korea to be placed under heavy sanctions.

The Washington Post first reported Monday that satellite images appear to indicate North Korea is possibly building two ICBMs at the same facility where the country produced its first long-range missiles, including the Hwasong-15 which make have the capability of hitting the U.S. East Coast.

Officials told the newspaper on condition of anonymity that North Korea’s intention was to deceive the U.S. by misconstruing the number of warheads as well as research facilities they have, while claiming they have fully denuclearized.

The intelligence suggested Kim is continuing to build-up his arsenal instead of honoring the commitment he made with Trump last month, the newspaper reported.

“We see them going to work, just as before,” one U.S. official told the paper.

A U.S. official also told Fox News there’s “no evidence” North Korea has halted work on missile development, despite dismantling parts of an engine test site in recent weeks.

Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a Senate panel North Korea continues to produce fissile material needed to make nuclear warheads. Pompeo refuted claims that the U.S. was being played by North Korea.

“I’m afraid that at this point, the United States, the Trump Administration is being taken for a ride,” said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.

“Fear not, senator. Fear not,” advised Pompeo.

The news comes one day before boxes of remains believed to contain some American service members from the Korean War are supposed to arrive in Hawaii from South Korea. A U.S. military aircraft arrived in North Korea last week to pick up the remains.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters Friday its unclear if the remains are American or whether they include French, Australian or other forces, one of the reasons the boxes were delivered in UN flags, not American flags. Officials say positive identification of the remains could take years.

While North Korea honored its promise to return the remains of fallen U.S. soldiers during the Korean War, there have been troubling reports that Pyongyang will never truly disarm.

Reports earlier this month revealed that the volatile regime is building a nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine, which came on the heels of CIA and other intelligence agencies telling NBC News that North Korea has increased its production of enriched uranium.

North Korea also called the talks with a delegation led by Pompeo in July “regrettable,” claiming the U.S. has undermined the spirit of the summit.

""We had expected that the U.S. side would offer constructive measures that would help build trust based on the spirit of the leaders' summit ... we were also thinking about providing reciprocal measures,"" Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry said in a statement, according to The Associated Press.

""However, the attitude and stance the United States showed in the first high-level meeting (between the countries) was no doubt regrettable,"" the spokesman said.

Pompeo had struck a different tone, telling reporters as he left that the talks with senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol had been “productive.”

North Korea launched its first successful ICBM on July 4, 2017. It conducted two additional tests later in the year, the last one in November, but questions remain about Pyongyang perfecting re-entry technology of its warheads from space and their ability to withstand the intense heat and pressure returning to earth.

An Aeromexico jetliner taking off in a blustery storm smashed down into a nearby field but skidded to a stop virtually intact, and all 103 people aboard were able to escape advancing flames before fire engulfed the aircraft.

Passengers expressed gratitude to be alive, but many were extremely shaken after the crash Tuesday afternoon.

""It was really, really ugly,"" said Lorenzo Nunez, a passenger from Chicago who fled the plane with his two sons and wife. ""It burned in a question of seconds,"" he told reporters, snapping his fingers for emphasis.

Survivors said the Embraer 190 plane burst into flames right after it hit the ground.

""We felt the flames coming quickly ... there was a lot of smoke,"" Jaquelin Flores told the newspaper El Sol.

Romulo Campuzano, head of a political party in Durango state who was on the plane, told Foro TV that both wings were on fire as he bolted from the aircraft.

Durango state Gov. Jose Aispuro said a gust of wind hit flight AM2431 heading from the city of Durango to Mexico City just as it was lifting off the tarmac, forcing the pilot to abort takeoff.

Passengers said they heard a loud noise as the plane's left wing banged to the ground, and both engines tore loose. The plane stayed upright, though, and the escape slides activated.

Aispuro said it was too soon to speculate on the cause of the crash. Mechanical failure and human error could be factors, but certainly the weather wasn't favorable. Strong wind and heavy rain with marble-sized hail lashed Durango city, even damaging hangars at the airport.

""The most important thing in the seriousness that is an accident of this nature is that there were no deaths — that's what is most encouraging for us,"" Aispuro said at a news conference.

After the accident, several passengers walked away from the plane before first responders arrived. Some sought medical help, while others rushed home to loved ones. Officials spent much of the afternoon tracking down survivors to ensure that everyone was accounted for.

Officials said 49 people had been hospitalized — most with minor injuries. The pilot suffered the most serious injury, a cervical lesion that required surgery. Some people had burns on a quarter of their bodies, said Durango state Health Ministry spokesman Fernando Ros.

Aispuro said all were expected to live.

Aeromexico Chief Executive Officer Andres Conesa described the day as ""very difficult"" and credited the timely reaction of crew and passengers for the lack of fatalities.

""Our heart is with those affected and their families,"" he said at an evening news conference.

Conesa said the passengers included 88 adults, nine children and two babies and the crew consisted of two flight attendants and two pilots.

He said the jetliner had been sent for maintenance in February and the crew was well-rested, having started their work day in Durango.

The web site Planespotters.net said the Brazilian-made medium-range jet was about 10 years old and had seen service with two other airlines before joining the Aeromexico fleet.

A Turkish court rejected an appeal Tuesday to end the house arrest of an American pastor who is at the center of an escalating diplomatic row between NATO allies Turkey and the United States, Turkey's state-run news agency reported.

The court in Izmir also refused to lift a travel ban that prevents Andrew Craig Brunson, 50, from leaving Turkey, ruling there was no change in the ""strong criminal suspicion"" against the pastor, the Anadolu Agency reported.

Brunson, who has lived in Turkey for more than two decades, was arrested in December 2016 on espionage and terror-related charges. He had been jailed until he was released to home detention on July 25.

The evangelical Christian pastor denies any wrongdoing. He faces a prison sentence of up to 35 years, if he is convicted on both counts at the end of his ongoing trial.

U.S. President Donald Trump demanded Brunson's release and announced possible sanctions last week against Turkey, a crucial NATO ally, for its treatment of him. The Turkish government refused to back down and called on the United States to respect Turkey's judicial process.

""It is unacceptable for the United States to use threatening language against Turkey over a continuing judicial case,"" presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said after a Cabinet meeting.

""Turkey will never give up on its principled stance,"" Kalin added.

He reiterated that Turkey would seek international arbitration if the United States refused to deliver F-35 fighter jets in retaliation.

Brunson's lawyer, Ismail Cem Halavurt, who filed the requests the court rejected, could not immediately be contacted for comment.

The fancy car, the luxury address, the gun.

How and why a security aide to French President Emmanuel Macron obtained them are at the heart of a political scandal dragging in the leader who promised voters an exemplary government before his election less than 15 months ago.

France has been consumed by a political firestorm in the two weeks since Le Monde newspaper revealed that a man often at the president's side beat up a protester while observing May Day demonstrations with police.

The violence, captured on video, led to questions about Alexandre Benalla's role at the presidential Elysee Palace. It also fed Macron's critics, who contend that the former investment banker runs the country like a private business with a small band of underlings.

Shock turned to anger once the public learned that government officials knew about the beating the day after it happened and only suspended Benalla for two weeks instead of firing him and reporting him to judicial authorities.

The punishment was widely perceived as so inadequate that it raised troubling questions: Was there a cover-up? Does France have a parallel police system or a deep state running the country from the shadows?

Macron has dismissed the growing scandal as a ""tempest in a teapot."" Yet the public outrage is having an impact. A staff reorganization at the Elysee presidential palace is expected in the fall. Public opinion polls suggest the crisis already has cost the French leader popularity points.

The government survived two no-confidence votes Tuesday in the lower house of parliament, where Macron's centrist party has control. But the virulent debate that accompanied the votes made it clear France's political opposition isn't about to let the drama die.

Authorities have moved swiftly to catch up with the firestorm. Benalla lost his job two days after Le Monde identified him. Days later, an investigating judge handed him preliminary charges, along with three ranking police officers and an employee of Macron's party who accompanied Benalla to the May 1 protest.

Usually invisible officials who run France have squirmed under TV lights.

The leaders of the national police, a general, the administrators who run the Elysee Palace and the interior minister were among those called before two parliamentary commissions to explain Benalla's initial light punishment, and why the 26-year-old had a gun permit and perks like an Elysee car, which is typically reserved for top police brass.

Macron, 40, did not say a word about the beating until six days after the video of it went viral, when he pushed back.

""Alexandre Benalla never held the nuclear codes. Alexandre Benalla never lived in a 300-square-meter apartment....Alexandre Benalla was never my lover,"" the president said, addressing news reports and rumors about the allegedly favorable treatment given his aide.

Macron said he viewed Benalla's violence as a betrayal, but voiced appreciation for the work and loyalty of a young man from a disadvantaged neighborhood in Normandy who the president said he wouldn't forget ""whatever happens.""

Despite the disclosures, an enigma hangs over the aide who signed onto Macron's security detail during his presidential campaign and rose quickly to his inner circle.

Benalla was given the vague title of ""charge de mission"" that kept him off the official books. He often was seen at Macron's side on official outings. However, the unclear nature of his duties has helped fuel speculation about secret police. The presidential palace has a complex security unit of military gendarmes and police.

Benalla has said his job was to organize presidential visits.

""There is no parallel police,"" the secretary-general of Elysee Palace, Alexis Kohler, insisted before the Senate inquiry commission.

Long before the scandal broke, Macron, who created a political party from scratch, was accused by detractors of mounting an imperial presidency and living atop a citadel, cut off from French citizens with whom he had vowed to connect.

Two recent polls suggest the Benalla affair hasn't helped. An Ipsos firm poll, taken shortly after the scandal broke, showed the president with a 32 percent popularity rating — four points lower than the previous month. A poll by the Ifop firm also measured a four-point drop in Macron's popularity a week into the crisis.

Some feel the affair has had too much impact.

""We shouldn't paralyze the country,"" said art gallery owner Franck Le Feuvre, who is among those who think the scandal is a waste of time. Benalla ""is just a guy who was too zealous, and no one dared intervene so as not to offend the big boss.""

Benalla has said that he regretted his actions became ""the source of multiple fantasies.""

Government officials testified before parliamentary inquiry commissions that Benalla was accorded an Elysee-owned apartment along the Seine while serving his suspension and also continued to receive his salary, which was to be deducted from his vacation time.

They also revealed that while working at the presidential palace, Benalla received a permit for a Glock pistol on his fourth try. The permit was approved after a new request, on new grounds, was transmitted to police by Macron's office director, Patrick Strzoda.

The sleek car with a police light used by the security aide was needed for presidential motorcades, Strzoda explained.

The commander on the ground at the May protest where Benalla was seen acting violently testified that he thought Benalla, who as an observer was illegally equipped with a police arm band and radio, was an officer in civilian clothes.",world

Southeast Asian nations are expected to welcome an initial negotiating draft of a nonaggression pact with China on the South China Sea, but critics warn that the protracted talks provide a diplomatic cover for Beijing's tenacious aggression in the disputed waters.

Top diplomats of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will also praise the rapprochement between the Koreas, along with that of President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, when they gather for four days of annual summitry in Singapore starting Wednesday.

Currently led by Singapore, the 10-nation bloc will host on Saturday Asia's largest security forum, including the key players involved in the Korean Peninsula's disarmament efforts, which will provide a chance for them to talk on the summit's sidelines.

Concern over rising extremism in the region and the plight of minority Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar's Rakhine state will also be under the spotlight. Myanmar is to brief the ASEAN foreign ministers on the situation in Rakhine during a lunch ""retreat,"" an informal gathering where ministers raise contentious issues that normally are a taboo in their staid plenary meetings.

Founded in 1967 in the Cold War era as a bulwark against communism, ASEAN has a bedrock principle of non-interference in each other's domestic affairs and decides by consensus, meaning even one member state can doom any proposal it deems offensive.

Those cardinal principles have drastically slowed decision-making and have been used by authoritarian leaders to dodge outside criticism, causing the diplomatic collective to be labeled by skeptics as a ""club of dictators"" and human rights violators. But its principles have allowed ASEAN to maintain diverse national identities, from rambunctious democracies to martial law regimes, for half a century.

The bloc has also been an acceptable broker for talks for all sorts of conflicts.

In the South China Sea disputes, which have pitted China, Taiwan and four ASEAN member states — Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam — the group is expected to announce an agreement with Beijing on an initial negotiating draft of a so-called ""code of conduct,"" a proposed set of regional norms and rules aimed at preventing the long-seething disputes from degenerating into a shooting war.

Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said Tuesday before flying to Singapore that talks on the code could be concluded this year or next. Other Asian diplomats have not been as optimistic.

The ministers will welcome ""the improving cooperation between ASEAN and China and were encouraged by the progress of the substantive negotiations towards the early conclusion of an effective code of conduct in the South China Sea on a mutually agreed timeline,"" according to a draft of a joint post-summit communique by the ministers which was obtained by The Associated Press.

Some of the ministers would repeat their concerns over China's transformation of seven disputed reefs into islands, including three with runways, which now resemble small cities armed with weapons, including surface-to-air missiles. China has come under intense criticisms for the aggressive action but it has said it has the right to build on its territory and defend them at all costs.

The ministers ""took note of the concerns expressed by some countries on the land reclamations in the area, which have eroded trust and confidence, increased tensions and may undermine peace, security and stability in the region,"" the draft communique said without naming China and reflecting the internal divisions over the touchy issue.

ASEAN member states Cambodia and Laos, which are known China allies, have opposed the use of strong language against Beijing over the disputes.

Greg Poling, director of the U.S.-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, which monitors developments in the South China Sea, said highlighting the draft code of conduct in the summit will be ""more political theater than substance at this point"" given the lack of agreement on areas it will cover and whether the pact should be legally binding after more than 15 years of talks.

Without any major concessions, especially from China, Poling said the talks would drag further while China presses actions to reinforce its vast territorial claims ""without paying much price because the code of conduct process offers diplomatic cover to claim it is seeking a peaceful and fair settlement.""

"The U.N. Security Council is planning to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Myanmar's violent crackdown that led about 700,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh at a meeting later this month.

British Ambassador Karen Pierce, the council president for August, said at a news conference Wednesday that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called the Rohingya crisis ""ethnic cleansing,"" is expected to brief the council at the session.

Pierce said Britain wants the Aug. 28 meeting to focus on gaining ""unconditional access"" to Myanmar for the U.N. refugee and development agencies so they can work with the Myanmar and Bangladesh governments ""to make a credible plan to get the refugees back home in safety, dignity and security.""

She said it's ""a huge issue"" that will also depend on Rohingya having ""livelihoods"" and places to live when they return. She also cited two other major issues — accountability for what happened and citizenship for Rohingya.

Rohingya face official and social discrimination in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, which denies most of them citizenship and basic rights because they are looked on as immigrants from Bangladesh even though the families of many settled in Myanmar generations ago. Dire conditions led more than 200,000 to flee the country between 2012 and 2015.

The latest crisis began with attacks by Rohingya insurgents on Myanmar security personnel last Aug. 25. The military responded with counterinsurgency sweeps and a scorched-earth campaign against Rohingya villages. It was accused of widespread human rights violations, including rape, murder, torture and the burning of Rohingya homes. Thousands are believed to have died.

The U.N. human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, has insisted that the possibility of genocide against Rohingya was real and has called for the issue to be referred to the International Criminal Court.

Pierce said the plight of the Rohingya would have to be referred by the Security Council and at the moment ""we are a hundred percent sure there would not be a positive decision."" China, a veto-wielding permanent council member close to Myanmar's government, would almost certainly oppose a referral.

But, Pierce said, ""there's a lot of collection of evidence going on in Bangladesh in the camps — evidence to a sufficiently high investigative standard against the day when there might be an accountability mechanism, and this might lead to some form of justice.""

She said this is being done by independent lawyers and the issue of whether there should be a more formal process to collect evidence is expected to be discussed in the coming weeks.

One possibility is turning to the U.N. General Assembly. The 193-member world body, where there are no vetoes, established an investigative body in December 2016 to assist in documenting and prosecuting the most serious violations of international law in Syria, including possible war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Pierce said the Aug. 25 council meeting will also review the humanitarian situation of Rohingya in Bangladesh, where they are currently struggling through monsoon rains, and encourage donors to help support them.",world

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Wednesday rejected accusations that Australia supported corruption and crime under Malaysia's former leader by harboring a high-profile fugitive since 2015.

Malaysian prime minister-in waiting Anwar Ibrahim recently said in an interview with Australia's ABC radio that some of Canberra's foreign policies ""clearly have been tainted"" and viewed as ""complicit to the tolerance of crimes, of corruption and also criminal action"" by shielding wrongdoers like former policeman Sirul Azhar Umar.

Sirul, who was a former bodyguard of ex-Prime Minister Najib Razak, fled to Australia after he was sentenced to death over the 2006 murder of Mongolian model Altantuya Shaariibuu. Her body was found blown up with explosives in a jungle after her yearlong affair with a friend of Najib ended.

Bishop said Sirul remained under immigration detention and that Malaysia has not made any extradition request.

""In the past, Australia has worked with the government of Malaysia of the day. For the past 61 years, it's been the same government. If we were waiting for the new government, we would have been waiting for 61 years before dealing with Malaysia and that's patently ridiculous,"" she told a news conference after meeting Anwar's wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who is now Malaysia's deputy prime minister.

Sirul's case has posed a dilemma for Australia's government, which cannot by law extradite someone who could face capital punishment.

His case cropped up again after the shocking defeat of Najib's coalition in May 9 elections that ushered in Malaysia's first transition of power since independence from Britain in 1957. Najib last month pleaded not guilty to charges of criminal breach of trust and abuse of power in a case linked to a massive corruption scandal in the 1MDB state fund that he set up but which accumulated billions in debts.

Malaysian police recently said they will reopen investigations into Shaariibuu's gruesome murder after her father lodged a fresh complaint with the new government.

Bishop said she didn't discuss Sirul's case specifically with Wan Azizah but they talked about Malaysia's plan in general to abolish the death penalty. Asked if Canberra will deport Sirul if Malaysia makes a request, she said she refused to ""speculate"" as there was no such application.

Bilateral relations were chilled for years after Canberra condemned Malaysia's ""barbaric"" execution of two Australian heroin traffickers in 1986.

Sirul and another former policeman were initially convicted in 2009 of Shaariibuu's murder but both won an appeal in 2013. The Supreme Court in 2015 upheld the initial High Court ruling. The prosecution contended that the murder of Shaariibuu was ordered by her former lover, Abdul Razak Baginda, a prominent defense analyst, after their affair ended.

The High Court in 2008 acquitted Abdul Razak, a married man and a former Najib confidante, of charges of abetting the murder.",world
"The president of one of the U.K.'s main Jewish groups called Thursday on the leader of the Labour Party to make an ""abject apology"" to British Jews for allowing anti-Semitism to fester in the left-of-center opposition party.

Allegations of anti-Jewish prejudice within Labour have grown since veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader in 2015. Some in the party allege that Corbyn, a longtime critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians, has allowed anti-Semitic abuse to go unchecked.

Corbyn apologized this week for the ""concerns and anxiety"" caused before he became Labour's leader when, as a pro-Palestinian activist, he shared platforms with people ""whose views I completely reject.""

But Board of Deputies of British Jews President Marie van der Zyl tweeted that Corbyn was ""hiding behind a half-hearted 'apology' no doubt crafted by his spin-doctors.""

""Jeremy Corbyn needs to stop hiding & make an abject apology to UK Jews in his own voice,"" she wrote.

The long-simmering dispute inside Labour recently boiled over after the party proposed adopting a definition of anti-Semitism that differed from the one approved by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.

The alliance says it is anti-Semitic to accuse Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than to their home countries, an example omitted from Labour's definition. The alliance also says it is anti-Semitic to compare contemporary Israeli policies to the policies of the Nazis, a view Labour did not endorse.

Corbyn also has received personal criticism for his past appearances alongside alleged anti-Semites and for some of his statements, including a 2010 speech in which he compared Israel's blockade of Gaza to Nazi Germany's sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad during World War II.

Labour's leadership is facing pressure to expel Peter Willsman, a party official who accused Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" of stirring up controversy around anti-Semitism.",world

Just a day after a harrowing escape from a crashed and burning Aeromexico jetliner, many of its 103 passengers and crew went to work on resuming their travel, with some even boarding new flights from the same airport in western Mexico.

Those who escaped serious injury scrambled to find clothing Wednesday, having lost their suitcases the previous afternoon when the plane plowed into a field shortly after takeoff during a violent storm. U.S. citizens who lost their passports met with consular officials who came to Durango to assist.

Some passengers spoke of one survivor who had sworn to never get on another plane and planned to buy a car and drive back to the United States.

Jose Luis Corral, a 52-year-old business owner from Portland, Oregon, still wore a neck brace from injuries he suffered in the crash.

""It's so fast, terrifying to see all the people screaming,"" recalled Corral, who was one of four people who helped the plane's badly injured pilot escape the blaze.

The pilot suffered a serious neck injury and was in the hospital. Forty-eight others were also injured, and 22 remained hospitalized Wednesday. Miraculously, no one died.

Aeromexico CEO Andres Conesa said late Wednesday that the pilot couldn't feel his feet when he was removed through a cockpit window, but after surgery had regained feeling throughout his legs.

Alberto Herrera, a 35-year-old webpage engineer from Chicago, said the violent storm shook the plane as it took off and seemed to come from nowhere.

""When we were sitting on the plane there was a little drizzle, but nothing to worry about. It was just a little light rain, super light, like barely hitting the windows,"" Herrera said.

But another passenger, Ramin Parsa, 32, of Los Angeles, said the weather was ominous even before takeoff.

""The airplane actually was shaking before we even moved so I knew it was dangerous weather,"" he said. ""I thought that we were going to have a delay until the weather clears up, but the pilot began to move, so I thought that he knows what he is doing.""

""I think it was a mistake by the pilot. He should not have taken off,"" Parsa said.

Durango state Gov. Jose Aispuro said it was too soon to speculate on the cause of the crash. Mechanical failure and human error could be factors, but certainly the weather wasn't favorable.

Herrera said the takeoff went wrong seemingly in an instant.

""You start gaining speed and as soon as you start taking off all of the sudden the plane starts struggling and it's getting hit with hail. The higher up we went into the storm, the heavier the hail got and more wind got to us,"" Herrera said.

""Then all of a sudden the plane starts rocking and it starts seriously, seriously moving around and then hitting the ground,"" he said. ""We skidded and hit a second time and you saw the flames. ...You're like 'This might be bad.'""

Herrera had braced for impact and yelled for others to do the same. The woman seated next to him was able to hold onto her toddler, though the little girl suffered some scratches and may have hit her head on a seat.

Officials said the impact ripped both engines off the Embraer 190 jetliner, and fire immediately broke out in the wings.

""My window turned red because of the flames,"" Parsa said.

He said he tried to kick out a window but couldn't. He searched for an exit and at first couldn't find one because of all the smoke. Then suddenly he felt fresh air on his face. He was in front of the exit.

""Imagine you put 100 people in a room, in a dark room, pitch dark, filled with smoke and there's a small door, everybody's trying to find it. That's what the situation was,"" Parsa said.

At the back exit, Herrera said the emergency slide deployed but the fuselage was at an odd angle, so it was unusable and people had to jump to the ground.

The passengers walked back across the muddy field to the end of runway and waited there for emergency vehicles.

Herrera credits the good outcome to both the pilot and to the fact that the plane had not gained much altitude when the storm broke.

""The pilot had to execute a maneuver correctly and then we hit the storm at its peak while we were going up, and not while we were up in the air,"" he said.

Mexico's Transport Department said the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board was sending two investigators to assist in the investigation, and the plane's manufacturer would also participate.

The department did not immediately answer questions about whether the airport was equipped with a Low Level Wind Shear Alert System that can detect weather conditions like severe downdrafts or microbursts.

Herrera got to the departure gate Wednesday evening just as a delay in his new flight was announced. Asked how he felt, he said: ""Pure anxiety.""

He had sought to limit his waiting at the airport by arriving close to departure time. He was flying to Mexico City on a plane that also carried seven other survivors, then catching a red-eye flight home to Chicago.

""I just want to get it out of the way,"" he said.

Yet the normally jovial Herrera also joked about his situation. He noted he had seen one Mexican television station calling the crash ""El Milagro de Durango — the Miracle of Durango.

""That's going to be the hashtag for the rest of my life,"" he said.",world
"An Australian woman who injured two people during a convenience store ax attack has been convicted of attempted murder after jurors reportedly rejected her argument that she was suffering from a mental episode caused by medications she was taking to transition from male to female.

Evie Amati, 26, was found guilty Friday for the unprovoked 2017 attack in Sydney and will face sentencing in September, according to the BBC.

""I really hope that [Amati] is able to have some sort of rehabilitation because ultimately that's what justice is about,” Sharon Hacker, a victim who suffered a fractured skull in the attack, told reporters following the verdict.

On January 7 last year, Amati was captured on surveillance video walking into a 7-Eleven store carrying an ax around 2 a.m. local time.

She walked up to a man waiting in line at the cash register, later identified as Ben Rimmer, and talked to him briefly before swinging the ax at him, the BBC reported. Rimmer fell to the ground with a facial wound and fractures, while Hacker was then attacked near the door.

Amati also targeted a third man outside the store, but he managed to protect himself by using his backpack as a makeshift shield.

The BCC reported that Amati was arrested outside the store. During her trial, the victims said they thought she had come from a costume party when she walked into the store with the weapon.

Amati pleaded not guilty and told jurors that she was in a bad mental state because she was taking hormones to help her transition from male to female, the station added.

Her lawyer, Charles Waterstreet, was quoted saying Amati was “out of her mind” and was also affected by drug and alcohol use.

But the jury ultimately sided against Amati, convicting her of two counts of wounding with intent to murder and another count of attempted wounding with intent to murder.",world

The Latest on the heatwave in Europe (all times local):

2:20 p.m.

The European Union is offering to speed up funds for farmers to help them cope with the effects of drought across the continent.

The EU's executive Commission said Thursday that farmers could obtain at least 70 percent of their rural development funds from mid-October instead of December, so they can deal with any cash flow problems.

The EU is also easing conditions that some farmers must meet to access money. In some cases, land required to be kept fallow and not used for production may be used grow animal feed.

At least eight of the 28 member countries have appealed for flexibility in the application of Europe's crop diversification and environment rules due to the adverse weather.

Hot air from Africa is bringing a new heatwave to Europe, prompting health warnings about Sahara Desert dust and exceptionally high temperatures that are forecast to peak at 47 degrees Celsius (116.6 Fahrenheit) in some southern areas.

The torrid weather meant public services were put on alert in the Iberian peninsula, where temperatures were forecast to reach 44 degrees (111 Fahrenheit) Thursday in the Portuguese city of Evora, 130 kilometers (81 miles) east of Lisbon and the Spanish province of Badajoz across the border.

A hot air mass was moving northward from Africa, authorities said, warning that the mercury could peak at 47 degrees Celsius this weekend in some areas of southern Portugal.

Portuguese authorities issued a nationwide health warning, including for dust from the Sahara Desert. Warnings were also issued for 40 of Spain's 50 provinces. The southeastern Portuguese town of Beja is expected to see a peak of 47 degrees C on Saturday.

Sweden's official tallest point is set to change amid record summer temperatures.

Scientists said a glacier on Kebnekaise mountain, the Scandinavian country's highest peak at 2,111 meters (6,925 feet, 10 inches), is melting and is no longer Sweden's tallest point.

Gunhild Rosqvist, a Stockholm University professor in geography, said the glacier lost four meters (13 feet, 2 ½ inches) of snow in July alone as Sweden endured record temperatures that triggered dozens of wildfires, even in the Arctic Circle.

In eastern Europe, Poland was also enduring unusually high temperatures as the hot African air pushed temperatures up to 34 degrees Celsius (93.2 Fahrenheit).

The country's power plants went into emergency mode to increase output due to wide use of air conditioning and electric fans. Authorities in Warsaw placed cooling water installations in the streets and advised people to stay indoors. Dozens of Baltic Sea beaches have ""no swimming"" warnings due to health risks from algae blooms.

The people of the flood-battered Indian state of Kerala are ""in a great struggle to rebuild their lives,"" the state's top official said Wednesday, as aid workers warned it could take days before the full scope of the destruction is clear.

Though rains have stopped over the past three days and floodwaters are receding, vast swaths of the tropical state, known for its idyllic villages and beautiful beaches, remain underwater or coated with mud, and many people have no drinking water or electricity.

""We know the humanitarian needs are enormous, but it will be some time before we know just how big that is,"" Ray Kancharla, a manager with the aid group Save The Children, said in a Tuesday statement. ""Roofs and walls have collapsed; roads have been completely washed away.""

He estimated it could take ""well over a week"" before the effects of the devastation are clear.

Torrential downpours began hammering Kerala on Aug. 8, more than two months into the annual monsoon season, setting off devastating floods that left more than 200 people dead and sent more than 800,000 fleeing for dry land.

"Even in his grave, the 20th-century dictator who ruled Spain with an iron fist keeps dividing the country.

Spain's new center-left government says removing the embalmed body of Gen. Francisco Franco from a glorifying mausoleum will be the first among many symbolic moves aimed at coming to terms with the country's troubled history.

Critics of the government and Franco's descendants are pushing back, vowing to preserve the memory of a regime they claim should be credited for ""modernizing Spain.""

Banning the foundation that preserves the legacy of Franco is precisely what should be done instead, says Fernando Martinez, the official appointed to oversee the government's efforts to unearth and identify the 114,000-or-so victims of the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War and the four decades of dictatorship that followed under Franco, who died in 1975.

""Exhuming the body of the dictator will begin healing the wounds of this country. But that task will only be completed when the last ditch with a mass grave in this country has been opened,"" Martinez told The Associated Press, speaking at the Ministry of Justice in Madrid, where his new Directorate General for Historic Memory is being formed.

""Exhuming the body of the dictator will begin healing the wounds of this country. But that task will only be completed when the last ditch with a mass grave in this country has been opened."" - Fernando Martinez, official appointed to oversee efforts to ID victims of Spanish Civil War

Martinez says creating an up-to-date census of anonymous burials in ditches across the country will be among the most pressing tasks for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's new government. Other moves include re-opening an office to help victims' relatives — an office closed under Spain's previous conservative government — setting up a new system for reparation payments and turning Franco's current burial place into a museum against fascism.

""We are going to accelerate and make up for lost time, it's a question of democratic dignity,"" says Martinez, who was appointed in July after Sanchez ousted conservative Mariano Rajoy with a no-confidence vote in June.

Three U.N-sponsored missions to Spain since 2013 had criticized authorities for lacking a national plan to search for missing people, for poor coordination on exhumations and for outdated maps of graves. They also raised concerns about the inaction of Spanish courts in prosecuting some of the period's darkest crimes.

But a panel of U.N. rights experts just recently praised the authorities' move for ""placing the right to truth at the top of the political agenda"" by leading the efforts to search for those disappeared as well as for vowing to create a Truth Commission to investigate crimes that occurred under Franco up until his death.

""This decision represents a fundamental step toward the realization of the right to truth for all victims of serious human rights violations,"" the rapporteurs wrote.

The government wants to adopt the changes by amending the 2007 Historic Memory Law, which fell short of addressing the demands of survivors and victims' relatives when Rajoy's conservative government eliminated its budgets for exhumations and reparations.

Emilio Silva, president of the Association for the Recovery of Historic Memory, or ARMH, says the new government should use its executive powers to remove Franco from the Valley of the Fallen — a macabre mausoleum 50 kilometers (31 miles) northwest of Madrid. He also wants the government to dig up all the graves of Franco's victims, rather than kicking off a grand political showdown between conservative and progressive voices in parliament.

""They fear a legal backlash,"" Silva said of the government. But he called digging up unmarked graves and compensating the relatives of identified victims ""very basic, human things. There shouldn't be any need to discuss them.""

With a towering 150-meter (500-foot) tall cross that can be seen from miles away, the somber neoclassic-style mausoleum and basilica of the Valley of the Fallen were built by Franco as a tribute to the dead during his so-called ""glorious crusade"" in overthrowing Spain's democratic government.

Some 34,000 people from both sides of the fratricidal war are buried at the site, most of them never identified, along with the remains of Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the fascist Spanish Falange party. Franco's tomb, a simple granite slate with only his name engraved, presides over the altar of the basilica. Fresh flowers are always on display.

Public events supporting the Franco regime were outlawed in 2007, but the grandiose site remains a popular pilgrimage destination for those nostalgic for the dictatorship.

Activists say the whole place exudes a totalitarian air and is an insult to the memory of the victims. They are also angry at the decrepit state of the remains, with water leaks that have turned the crypts into ""piles of bones,"" according to an expert's assessment in 2011.

Martinez says the projected revision of the law will include a proposal to remove symbols celebrating the dictatorship and will rebrand the Valley into a monument for reconciliation and a museum that tells about the abuses during its construction, including the use of political prisoners as forced laborers.

But the government, which failed to exhume Franco by July as promised, is facing a myriad of obstacles, including its weak position in parliament.

Hundreds of people nostalgic for Francoism have staged protests at the Valley, and conservative parties are accusing Sanchez's administration of reopening a chapter they consider closed instead of focusing on 21st-century problems.

Meanwhile, descendants of Franco's family are refusing to cooperate with authorities, mounting a legal case against plans to exhume the dictator and refusing to take his remains to the family sepulchral vault in Galicia. With their refusal, authorities are faced with the dilemma of what to do with Franco's remains.

Digging Franco up, Martinez said, aims to ""consolidate our democracy,"" which was peacefully instituted in the late 70s upon the death of the dictator.

Martinez refused to venture a date for the Franco exhumation. But even if it succeeds, Sanchez's government will face the politically sensitive task of outlawing the National Francisco Franco Foundation, which up to 2003 was receiving public funding for safeguarding documents from the 1939-1975 regime.

The Franco Foundation did not respond to AP's requests for comment, but in recent statements online, officials said any attempt to ban them would be against Spain's Constitution, which protects freedom of speech. Its president, retired Gen. Juan Chicharro, wrote that the foundation must defend itself from ""the staggered outlawing of everyone who doesn't bend to the totalitarian demands"" of the Spanish left.

ARMH's Silva said ""banning the foundation does not limit their freedom to express their ideas,"" it just restricts their access to public funding.

Martinez believes the issue is not about free speech but about protecting Spain's democracy.

""Every foundation justifying Francoism has no space in democracy, the same way it wouldn't by supporting fascism or a Nazi ideology, because these are ideologies that go against democratic values and liberties,"" he said. ""Those of us in favor of democracy have a mandate to defend democracy.""",world

Egypt is trying to broker a broad cease-fire deal between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers that is to pave the way for Gaza's reconstruction and an eventual prisoner swap, senior Hamas officials said Thursday.

Repeated cease-fire deals over the years collapsed, but there were signs of possible momentum toward a new agreement, after weeks of escalation along the Gaza-Israel frontier.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to put off a trip to South America to keep an eye on the situation in Gaza, a government official said Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.

Separately, a high-level Hamas delegation planned to enter Gaza later Thursday after holding talks in Cairo, said the Palestine Information Center, a Hamas-linked website.

Most of the Hamas leadership is based in Gaza but would be joined by exiled members of the group's political bureau, including Saleh Arouri, a founder of the Hamas military wing in the West Bank and a mastermind of violent attacks against Israelis in the past.

""Permitting a delegation with this level to come to Gaza is a clear sign that there are first of all guarantees that the delegation will not be targeted by the Israelis, and a sign that there are serious meetings to be held in Gaza,"" said Bassem Naim, a Gaza-based Hamas official.

He said Hamas officials would try to ""conclude the progress that has been made on files such as the truce,"" as well as a U.N.-led rebuilding of Gaza and possible reconciliation between Hamas and its domestic political rival, West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

Naim said the Hamas leaders would also talk about a possible prisoner swap with Israel.

Two other senior Hamas officials confirmed the outlines of the deal proposed by Egypt. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to provide details of closed-door negotiations.

It's not clear what role Abbas would play in Gaza, if any. He has said in the past that he would only resume responsibility for Gaza if Hamas agrees to hand over all authority there, including over security. Hamas has been unwilling to do so.

Gaza has endured a crippling border blockade by Israel and Egypt, imposed after Hamas seized the territory in 2007. In recent months, Hamas has become more desperate amid mounting financial pressure, including from Abbas. Gaza's 2 million people have had to contend with blockade-linked electricity shortages, rising unemployment and growing poverty.

Despite renewed cease-fire efforts, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced that, starting Thursday, he is halting shipments of fuel and natural gas to Gaza in response to incendiary balloons that have targeted southern Israel.

Israel also suspended fuel shipments to Gaza temporarily in July for similar reasons.

Incendiary balloons and kites, many set off during border protests organized by Hamas, have caused fires that have devastated southern Israel's farmland and forests.

Since late March, thousands of Gaza residents have participated in frequent protests along Israel's perimeter fence, in part to try to break the blockade.

In the past four months, 155 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli fire, including at least 117 in protests near the fence, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry and the Gaza rights group Al Mezan. Others, including Hamas militants, have been killed in other incidents, including Israeli airstrikes. Last month, an Israeli soldier was killed by sniper fire from Gaza.",world
"No Australian prime minister in the past decade has lasted a full three-year term before being dumped by his or her own party.

It's a new era of political instability that most Australians hate. Voters expect that they will get to judge their leaders at the ballot box. Many feel hoodwinked when they go to elections expecting one national leader, then later have another imposed upon them.

The tactic of swapping leaders in the hope of boosting governments' standing in opinion polls as elections loom has left parties bitterly divided. Foreign governments are left wondering whether Australian leaders will be around long enough to fulfill bilateral agreements.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is the latest to face the prospect of not leading his conservative Liberal Party to the next election, due by May.

There are things to know about how these political processes work.

___

HOW AUSTRALIAN PARTIES DUMP THEIR LEADERS

Australians often talk about voting for a political leader to become prime minister in the same way that Americans discuss electing a president. But it has become increasingly evident that the leaders of the major parties have been chosen by party lawmakers and have been replaced at the same lawmakers' discretion.

A petition signed by a majority of the Liberal Party's 85 lawmakers — at least 43 — is enough to trigger a party meeting to hold a leadership ballot. It's a secret ballot but the final numbers are made public.

Turnbull headed off that process and gained the advantage of surprise by declaring his own job open to nominations on Tuesday. Few had been forewarned. Senior minister Peter Dutton was the only candidate nominated. Many were surprised that he only lost by 48 votes to 35 since he hadn't started canvassing support in earnest. One of the 85 lawmakers entitled to vote was away on sick leave and another abstained.

Dutton will now negotiate with his colleagues on what it will take to win their support, including policy changes and Cabinet promotions.

Turnbull ousted his predecessor, Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a Dutton ally, in the same way almost three years ago.

___

THE OPPOSITION HAS LEARNED FROM ITS MISTAKES

The instability began when the center-left Labor Party in elections in 2007 ended Liberal Prime Minister John Howard's run of more than 11 years in office. It was the second-longest term an Australian prime minister has served.

Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was suddenly replaced during his first term by his deputy, Julia Gillard, who was replaced three years later by Rudd.

Many in Labor concluded that Rudd shouldn't have been dumped in the first place and the party changed its rules to make ousting a prime minister more difficult.

Labor lawmakers now only have a 50 percent say in the choice of leader. Previously the decision was theirs alone, like the Liberal Party. Labor Party grassroots members who are not elected now have an equal say in who becomes leader. The balloting of party members who are not lawmakers takes a month, meaning Australians will never again wake to news that a Labor prime minister had been changed without warning.

___

PERIODS OF INSTABILITY HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE

There have been two periods of leadership instability in recent decades and both have involved a prime minister's unexpected death.

From 1966 to 1972 there were six prime ministers, including Harold Holt who vanished while body surfing in 1967.

From 1939 to 1945, there were eight, including Frank Forde who was replaced by his Labor colleagues after only eight days in office.",world

Cambodia's Supreme Court denied a bail request Wednesday for Kem Sokha, the leader of the now-dissolved main opposition party who has been detained for nearly a year without trial on a treason charge. As with his previous bail hearings, he was not taken to court for what has previously been explained as security reasons.

The ruling followed an apparent softening of the government's harsh stance toward critics. Four land rights activists were pardoned and released from prison on Monday, and two journalists who formerly worked for U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia were released Tuesday on bail as they await trial on espionage charges.

The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party was dissolved by the court last year, with no convincing evidence, for alleged complicity in a treason plot supposedly backed by the United States.

Prime Minister Hun Sen cracked down on critics and opponents last year in what was seen as an effort to ensure his party would win elections this year and give him another five years in power. He has led the country for more than three decades and has said he intends to remain at the helm for at least 10 more years.

Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party, with no credible opposition, won a clean sweep in last month's general election.

The first leader and co-founder of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, Sam Rainsy, has been in self-imposed exile since 2016 to avoid serving a prison term for a defamation conviction. Kem Sokha succeeded him and was put under severe legal pressure in several cases last year, culminating in his arrest last September.

The Supreme Court, sustaining a ruling by the Appeals Court, said Kem Sokha, 65, had to remain in custody to ensure social stability.

Kem Sokha's lawyers said he should be freed on bail because the investigation of his case is complete and he was sick and needed medical treatment. Judge Kong Srim responded that he was not particularly sick and could be treated by prison doctors if necessary.",world

His coach had a heart attack and couldn't travel. He had to take three school exams in an embassy under close scrutiny of two government officials flown in to Jakarta to supervise.

And after all that, in the event where he was contending for an Asian Games medal, a teammate dived too early and Sri Lanka was disqualified from the heats in the 4x100-meter freestyle relay on Wednesday morning.

It has been a testing time indeed for Akalanka Peiris.

""This week was so, so hectic for me,"" said Peiris, who had to skip the opening ceremony last weekend because of his tight testing schedule — both academic and physical.

Still, the 18-year-old student from St. Peter's College in Colombo said he'd rather be here than anywhere else.

When the timetable clash became apparent between his exams and the Asian Games, Peiris decided it would be better to take the tests. His rationale was that even if he put them off for a year, some other sports event could crop up then. Also, he figured, he'd be a more competitive swimmer in four years at next Asian Games.

""I chose the exam,"" he said. ""After that, the Olympic committee wanted me to swim the relay because we had a bronze medal prospect.""

That's how Sri Lanka's national Olympic committee got involved. After high-level negotiations, the committee worked out a way for Peiris to become the first Sri Lankan student to take the tests while abroad.

It came at a cost — two extra airfares and accommodation for the ""invigilators"" — exam proctors — from the Sri Lankan examination department. Plus space had to be found at the Sri Lankan embassy for him to take the tests for English, general knowledge, and economics.

""The people really supported me very well,"" Peiris said. ""English and general knowledge was easy for me. The accounting paper was the difficult one, but I made it.""

The first test was Saturday and his last test was Monday, right after he'd placed fourth in his heat of the 50-meter backstroke.

Peiris said he'd had so much support from the delegation and the local organizers, and was only sorry his regular coach Manoj Abeysinghe — father of two of his relay teammates Matthew and Kyle Abeysinghe — had health problems last week.

""Manoj was going to come, but four or five days before he had a heart attack,"" Peiris said. ""We missed him a lot.""

The Sri Lankans posted a competitive time that would have earned them a spot in the final, but was rubbed out after the narrowly illegal change.

""We did a great job. We went our PBs, but unfortunately a small mistake had big repercussions,"" he said. ""We missed the opportunity to get the bronze medal.

""But it's OK. We'll work on it (and) we'll do something in the South Asian Games and next Asian Games as well.""

In the immediate future are more events — the 50-meter butterfly and the 200 backstroke — then thinking about university and more swimming either in the United States or Australia.",world
"The U.N. political chief called on Israel Wednesday to ensure that urgently needed humanitarian supplies for the Gaza Strip are not ""held hostage to political and security developments.""

Undersecretary-General for Political Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council its meeting was taking place ""in the wake of yet another series of violent escalations that threatened to plunge Gaza into war.""

She said the recurring violence ""highlights the urgency"" of U.N. and Egyptian-led efforts, along with regional and international partners, ""to prevent another devastating outbreak of hostilities, respond to the most urgent humanitarian needs, and support intra-Palestinian reconciliation.""

DiCarlo said funding for U.N. emergency fuel to keep about 250 hospitals, water and sanitation facilities in Gaza operating at a minimum level ""has now run out.""

She appealed for $4.5 million to keep these critical facilities operating through the end of the year.

DiCarlo also expressed concern at ""the dangerously short supply of essential medicines, with 40 percent of essential drugs completely depleted.""

Israel and Egypt have imposed an economically crippling blockade on Gaza since Hamas seized control of the coastal territory from the internationally backed Palestinian Authority in 2007.

Israel says the blockade is needed to contain Hamas, a militant group that seeks its destruction.

While the closure has devastated Gaza's economy, it has failed to oust Hamas or loosen its grip on power.

Since July, Israel and Hamas have engaged in three rounds of heavy fighting, with Hamas firing dozens of rockets into Israel and the Israeli military carrying out dozens of airstrikes in Gaza.

DiCarlo said that in recent weeks the humanitarian situation in Gaza had ""deteriorated further, due in part to additional restrictions that Israel imposed on the movement of goods through the Kerem Shalom crossing"" — the primary avenue for food, fuel, construction materials and aid to enter the beleaguered territory.

Israel closed the crossing in response to the violence and Hamas' launching of incendiary kites and balloons that have burned thousands of acres of Israeli fields, forests and agricultural land. The crossing was reopened by Israel on Aug. 15 when it also expanded the fishing zone off Gaza to nine nautical miles.

""As we work towards a full lifting of the closures on Gaza ...,"" DiCarlo said, ""I call on all parties to ensure that urgently needed humanitarian supplies reach the Strip.""

She said violent incidents have also continued elsewhere in the Palestinian territories and in Israel.

But at the same time DiCarlo cited tangible steps by ordinary Israelis and Palestinians ""to promote tolerance and forge a shared future.""

As the international community focuses on resolving the crisis in Gaza and returning the legitimate Palestinian government to the strip, she said, the perseverance of this individuals is a reminder of the broader goal of achieving a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians live side by side in peace and security.",world

Recent revelations of sexual misconduct and cover-up within the highest ranks of the U.S. Catholic Church have revived the sense of betrayal that devastated the American church's credibility after the first wave of scandal hit in 2002.

But the United States is by no means alone: Cases of Catholic priests raping and molesting children, and of bishops covering up for them, have erupted on nearly every continent in recent years, with Pope Francis' native Latin America the latest to explode.

Francis is expected to address the issue head-on this weekend when he visits Ireland, the first country to come to grips with the problem in the 1990s.

A glance of where the global Catholic scandal has played out most visibly in recent years:

UNITED STATES

After the abuse scandal erupted in Boston in 2002, U.S. bishops adopted the toughest anti-abuse norms in the Catholic Church, a ""one strike and you're out"" policy that removes any priest from ministry if he commits a single act of abuse that is admitted to or established.

The norms require dioceses to report allegations to police and have a lay-led review board to receive and assess claims.

The U.S. scandal was revived in June with revelations that one of the cardinals who drafted the 2002 policy, the retired archbishop of Washington Theodore McCarrick, himself had been accused of molesting at least two minors as well as adult seminarians. He has said he is innocent, but recently resigned as a cardinal.

The scandal has exploded anew with the Pennsylvania grand jury report finding some 300 priests sexually abused at least 1,000 children in six dioceses since the 1940s.

___

CHILE

Francis discovered first-hand just how pervasive clerical sex abuse is — and how effectively it has been covered up by the Catholic hierarchy — when he created the greatest scandal of his five-year papacy earlier this year.

During a January visit to the once staunchly Catholic Chile, Francis set off a firestorm of criticism when he branded as ""calumny"" accusations of cover-up against a Chilean bishop he had strongly defended.

After realizing his error, Francis did an about-face: He ordered a Vatican investigation, apologized in person to the victims he had discredited, and strong-armed the entire Chilean hierarchy to tender their resignations.

It wasn't enough. Chilean criminal prosecutors are now on the case, and have staged a series of raids on the church's secret archives to seize documents and plan to depose the current archbishop of Santiago.

___

AUSTRALIA

Australia launched a four-year national investigation into all forms of institutional abuse — Catholic and otherwise — that found 4,444 people were abused at more than 1,000 Catholic institutions between 1980 and 2015.

The Royal Commission investigation, Australia's highest form of inquiry, deduced that seven percent of Catholic priests in Australia between 1950 and 2010 had been accused of sexually abusing children.

One of them is Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican finance minister and Francis adviser who last year took a leave of absence to stand trial in Melbourne on historic sex abuse charges. Pell has said he is innocent.

More recently, Francis accepted the resignation of Adelaide Archbishop Philip Wilson after he became the most senior Catholic cleric convicted in criminal court of covering up abuse. He was sentenced to serve a one-year sentence at home. Wilson has denied wrongdoing and plans to appeal.

___

FRANCE

One of France's most prominent cardinals, Philippe Barbarin, is due to stand trial in January on charges he covered up for a known pedophile in Lyon, where Barbarin has been archbishop since 2002.

Barbarin and five other French defendants are accused of knowing that the Rev. Bernard Preynat sexually abused young scouts but didn't report him to police. Preynat, now in his 70s, has confessed in letters to victims' parents and meetings with his superiors, including Barbarin.

Another defendant is the Vatican official in charge of abuse cases, named because Barbarin consulted him about Preynat and was told to keep the priest away from children but to do everything to avoid scandal.

Just this week, a French priest, the Rev. Pierre Vignon, launched a petition urging Barbarin to resign as archbishop and cardinal. By Wednesday it had gathered more than 5,000 signatures.

Barbarin, 67, has admitted to making some ""mistakes"" in the management and nominations of priests, but has denied any attempt to cover up the Preynat case.

___

IRELAND

Judge-led investigations have produced four mammoth reports since 2005 into the church's wretched record in dealing with predator priests, helping to dismantle the Catholic Church's once- dominant influence in Irish society and politics.

The reports have detailed how tens of thousands of children suffered wide-ranging abuses in church-run workhouse-style institutions, how Irish bishops shuttled known pedophiles throughout Ireland and to unwitting parishes in the U.S. and Australia, and how Dublin bishops didn't tell police of any crimes until forced by the weight of lawsuits in the mid-1990s.

One of the final investigations, into the diocese of Cloyne, found that officials there were still shielding suspected pedophiles from the law until 2008 — more than 12 years after the Irish church unveiled a policy requiring the mandatory reporting of all suspected crimes to police.

That policy, however, was rejected by the Vatican in 1997 as undermining canon law — a position that, combined with the Vatican's refusal to cooperate in the Irish fact-finding probes, prompted the Cloyne inquiry to find the Vatican itself culpable in promoting the culture of cover-up.

In response, Ireland's then-Prime Minister Enda Kenny issued a blistering attack on the Vatican, accusing it of downplaying the rape of children to protect its own power and reputation.

Kenny's 2011 parliament speech, in which he denounced ""the dysfunction, disconnection, elitism....the narcissism that dominate the culture of the Vatican to this day,"" led to a diplomatic standoff.

___

VATICAN CITY

While only a few hundred people live in the world's tiniest sovereign state, Vatican City's criminal jurisdiction covers the Holy See's global diplomatic corps, and two priestly diplomats have faced trial in recent years.

In June, the Vatican tribunal convicted Monsignor Carlo Capella of possession and distribution of child pornography and sentenced him to five years in prison. Capella admitted to viewing the images during a period of ""fragility"" and interior crisis sparked by his job transfer to the Vatican embassy in Washington.

In 2013, the Vatican charged its then-ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Monsignor Jozef Wesolowski, with sexually abusing young boys. Wesolowski was defrocked by the Vatican's church court, but he died before the Vatican's criminal trial got underway.",world

A man with severe psychiatric problems killed his mother and sister and seriously injured another woman in a knife attack Thursday in a Paris-region town, officials said.

Police shot and killed the man soon afterward. The Islamic State group, which has a history of opportunistic claims, swiftly claimed responsibility.

French prosecutors weren't treating the attack in Trappes, west of Paris, as a terrorism case, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said. He noted the attacker suffered from serious mental health issues although he had also been flagged for glorifying terrorism.

Collomb said that the man killed his mother at her home and stabbed the other women outside. Still wielding the knife, he then ignored police warnings and was shot and killed, the minister said after meeting officers and prosecutors in Trappes.

He described the man as ""unstable, rather than someone who was engaged, someone who could respond, for example, to orders and instructions from a terrorist organization, in particular from Daesh."" Daesh is another name for IS.

A long-time friend of the attacker named him as Kamel Salhi, 36. The friend, Said Segreg, said Salhi had no obvious problems, didn't abuse drugs or alcohol and wasn't fervently religious.

A government official confirmed Salhi's name and age. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss such details publicly.

Salhi was divorced and living with his mother, said Adama Traore, another of his acquaintances in Trappes.

The Islamic State group, via its Aamaq news agency, claimed responsibility. The agency said the attack was motivated by calls from the IS leadership to attack civilians in countries at war with the extremist group. Hours earlier, IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi urged followers to attack enemies everywhere.

The Islamic State group, which has lost most of the territories it once controlled in Iraq and Syria, has been known to make opportunistic claims in the past, even when there was no established link between an attacker and the extremist group.

What's left of Finton Lewis' thinning hair is spiked and dyed an orange-red color.

The 64-year-old Lewis says the haircut keeps him feeling younger on the outside, and playing the card game of bridge keeps his brain nimble on the inside.

""I know I'm not as physically fit as most sports people are,"" said Lewis, who is playing for India in the bridge competition at the Asian Games.

Being fit doesn't matter much in bridge, which is being included for the first time in the Asian Games. Fans like to talk it up as a ""mind game"" in the same realm as chess.

Yang Kong Te of the Philippines is playing in the Asian Games at 85. Lee Hung Fong of Malaysia is 81. Indonesian billionaire Michael Bambang Hartono is a mere 78, and the big reason why bridge is on the schedule. His reported net worth in about $17 billion, a fortune made in tobacco, banking, and communications.

To be fair, the median age of the field is about 50, which is still generations away from 9-year-old Indonesian skateboarder Aliqqa Novvery — the youngest of the more than 11,000 competitors in the Asian Games.

The Olympic Council of Asia, which governs the games, reportedly balked at including bridge, which in the eyes of some is linked with card games such as poker, black jack — and hence, gambling.

To be fair, bridge would be as out of place in a casino as bullfighting in Bhutan.

The auditoriums set up for bridge are hushed, dotted with dozens of card tables with four players at each. At one session, curious photographers were given access for just five minutes, and then ushered away. Fans can watch the hands that are dealt — and how they are played — on large television screens filled with the red and black symbols for spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs.

""The photographers really wouldn't matter because the top players zone out these distractions,"" Aaida Abu-Jaber, a player from Jordan told The Associated Press. ""They are in their zone and focused and they don't know what's happening around them. They are just looking at their cards and thinking.""

Abu-Jaber called it ""athletics of the mind, rather than the body.""

There's no age limit, and no language barrier. Abu-Jaber said she's played against dozens of nationalities — on-line and in-person. The game has a universal language everyone understands, driven by English-rooted words like ""no trump, slam, pass""and so forth.

""You can play with anybody, even if you can't understand their language and they can't understand yours,"" she said.

Though age is no problem, attracting a younger generation is.

Asadullah Khan, who is playing for Pakistan, joked that many of the players have ""no hair and protruding bellies. Most of us are smokers and losing our cognitive skills.""

For the record, 54-year-old Khan has all his hair — gray hair and a gray mustache.

""It's going to be an extinct game if the younger generation doesn't take it up,"" he said. ""The younger people are not enthusiastic about bridge, not excited about it unless it runs in the family.""

Khan said attracting younger players might be easy since bridge offers sedentary thrills, perhaps like computer games.

He argued that ""defending a (card) hand well or making a special play"" was just as exciting as serving an ace in tennis.

He even pushed for inclusion in the Olympics, which seems unlikely.

""It surely should be in the Olympics,"" Khan said. ""Getting exposure like this helps.""",world

An approaching typhoon has whipped up strong winds, waves and heavy rain in southern South Korea, leaving one person missing and one injured, while another typhoon headed for western Japan on Thursday.

Typhoon Soulik is forecast to make landfall at the southwestern town of Seocheon at 3 a.m. Friday, dumping 3-6 inches (7-15 centimeters) of rain and gusts of up to 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour, meteorologists said. It is expected to weaken after crossing the Korean Peninsula's mountainous terrain.

President Moon Jae-in instructed officials to review whether to reschedule or change venues for rare reunions of Korean families separated by war. The second round of meetings is set for Friday at a North Korean mountain resort where the typhoon is expected to pass.

A 23-year-old woman was listed as missing after she was apparently swept away by waves while taking a photo on Jeju Island on Wednesday night, a disaster response agency said.

It said the waves also left a 31-year-old man injured.

More than 200 flights have been canceled in South Korea and many schools throughout the country plan to cancel classes on Friday.

Moon called for special efforts to minimize damage that's expected from the typhoon.

Another typhoon called Cimarron is expected to cross western Japan on Thursday night. Japan's weather agency has warned of strong gusts, high waves and heavy rain.

Airlines canceled over 300 flights to and from airports in the Shikoku and Kinki regions, according to Japan's Kyodo News service.

On Wednesday morning, three university students went missing along the coast of the central Japanese city of Shizuoka, Kyodo said.

"Two people were killed and one other was wounded Thursday in a knife attack outside Paris, authorities said.

The stabbing occurred in Trappes, located about 20 miles west of Paris. The assailant, who was only identified as a male, was killed by police.

Islamic State claimed the attack through its propaganda arm, but failed to provide evidence.

"A 7.1-magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Peru, close to its borders with Bolivia and Brazil on Friday morning, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.

The quake was recorded at 4:04 a.m. local time at a depth of 378 miles.

The epicenter was 83 miles west of the Peruvian village of Inapari and 140 miles west of the Bolivian city of Cobija.

There was no immediate information on damage or casualties.

In 2001, at least 74 people were killed after an 8.1 magnitude earthquake shook southern Peru and triggered a tsunami, the U.K.'s Express reported.

Earlier this week, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake shook Venezuela Tuesday, the USGS reported.

"A Thai boy was beaten to death by an incensed Buddhist monk after the child displayed ""playful"" behavior during a temple prayer session, Thai police said Friday.

Monk Suphachai Suthiyano, 64, allegedly assaulted Wattanapol Sisawad, 9, with a bamboo stick and slammed the boy's head against a pillar before Sisawad fell into a coma last weekend, AFP reported. Sisawad died as a result of his injuries on Thursday.

Suthiyano reportedly flew into a rage after the young boy disrupted a Buddhist ceremony at the temple in Kanchanaburi, Thailand, two hours west of Bangkok.

Thai police originally charged Suthiyano with assault when he was arrested Sunday, but, after the boy’s death, the charge will be revised to assault resulting in death, authorities said.

Suthiyano lost his status as a monk following the arrest.

Sisawad's mother told Thai media she “will not forgive"" Suthiyano.

"A nurse for aid group Doctors Without Borders launched a terror attack on Israeli troops near the Gaza border Monday, shooting and throwing an explosive device at soldiers before being shot dead, Israeli officials said.

Hani al-Majdalawi was killed during a gun battle with Israel Defense Forces as he tried to slip past a border fence and gain entrance to Israel.

No Israeli troops were injured in the incident, The Times of Israel reported.

“He who takes part in saving lives should assist in humanitarian activities in the Gaza Strip, and should not take part in terrorism,” Maj. Gen. Kamil Abu Rokon, the head of Israel Defense Ministry body COGAT, said in a statement. COGAT coordinates government activities with Palestinians.

Al-Majdalawi’s brother, Osama, wrote on Facebook that al-Majdalawi was recently married, expecting a child and not affiliated with any militant groups. Osama also noted, however, that his brother had purchased a rifle.

Doctors Without Borders confirmed al-Majdalawi had worked for the group and was killed by Israeli troops. But the group didn’t comment on why al-Majdalawi put down his medical kit and picked up a rifle, with a spokesperson telling the Associated Press the organization was still “working to verify and understand the circumstances regarding this extremely serious incident.”

"Germany faces a growing threat from children raised in Salafist families, according to the country’s domestic intelligence service.

A recent report issued by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), warned that these children are “educated from birth with an extremist world view that legitimizes violence against others and degrades those who aren’t part of their group.”

The radicalization of youngsters is happening faster and earlier, according to Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germany’s BfV.

Frank Jansen, a journalist with Berlin’s centrist paper Der Tagesspiegel, and an expert on extremism in Germany, notes that most of the Salafist minors in the BfV report are younger than eight-years-old. According to Jansen, the report calls these children ticking time bombs.

ANGELA MERKEL ADMITS THAT 'NO-GO ZONES' EXIST IN GERMANY

""Their education is especially fanatic when militant parents propagate holy war,” Jansen wrote.

Salafism is an Islamist ideology that advocates the replacement of democratic government and law with a theocratic state based on Sharia. Since it first appeared in Germany in 2004, the number of Salafists has nearly tripled to 10,800, with nearly a quarter of them under the age of 26. It is the fastest growing Islamist trend in Germany.

Although not all Salafists advocate violence, the report stresses, the affirmation of violence is an inherent part of Salafist ideology.

Many Salafists are German converts to Islam. Others come from Turkish Muslim families who have lived in Germany since the late 1960’s. The report does not take into account the 1.5 million Muslim refugees who came to Germany from Syria and Afghanistan in 2015-16, according to a BfV spokesman.

Salafism has special allure for marginalized Muslim adults and youth.

ANTI-MUSLIM TWEET LANDS GERMAN MINISTER IN HOT WATER WITH POLICE

“It’s like an ersatz family for some youths,” said Claudia Dantschke, an expert on Islam and head of the Office for Islamism and Ultra-Nationalism, a Berlin-based NGO. “It’s where they find recognition and security.”

It also appeals to those who feel they are victims of bias in German society. The movement asserts that devotion to Islam enables Muslims to have an identification beyond the nation where they live.

Salafist recruiters are effective because, unlike the imams at most German mosques who preach in Arabic or Turkish, they preach in German, often using teenage slang. The indoctrination and radicalization are also effective because recruitment often takes place in small circles and online, according to the report.

Salafism’s growing infiltration of the Berlin public schools also corresponds with an increase in anti-Semitism in the classrooms, according to an August 2017 study by the American Jewish Committee Office in Berlin.

Anti-Semitism is an essential element in the ideology of the entire Islamist spectrum, according to the BfV report. This propaganda uses age-old stereotypes and prejudices, prevalent from medieval times through the Nazi era.

Conservative members of the German parliament have reacted to the Salafist threat with a call for police monitoring of Muslim children under age 14, the lowest age currently permitted in most German states. Civil rights organizations, however, have voiced strong objections to such surveillance. Humanist Union, a civil rights group, says it is unreasonable to consider children a threat because their ideas and opinions are not fully developed and are subject to change.

“This is not about criminalizing people under the age of 14,” counters Patrick Sensburg, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, “But about warding off significant threats to our country.”

Gotz Nordbruch, co-head of Ufuq, a German-based organization that deals with primary prevention in the realm of religious extremism, objects to the amount of attention that is being focused on Salafist youngsters.

Nordbruch noted that the 24,000 rightwing, neo-Nazi extremists in Germany are more numerous than the Salafists and sworn to a more visible violence. No one would consider investigating their children, he said, pointing out that the debate stigmatizes Muslim youngsters and makes them afraid to talk about the things that are relevant to them.

While acknowledging that the relatively small number of Salafists may be reaching as many as 300,000 people through social media, Nordbruch is working to train teachers to engage constructively with vulnerable children.

“My view is that this exaggerated attention on these kids is actually polarizing society more than necessary,” he said, referring to the calls for police investigation of young Muslim children.",world

A prominent Irish survivor of priestly sexual abuse told a Vatican-sponsored conference Friday that the Holy See must put in place ""robust structures"" and strong sanctions to hold accountable bishops and Vatican officials who fail protect children from predator priests.

Marie Collins, a former member of Pope Francis' abuse advisory board, urged Catholic families attending the Dublin conference to ask why the pope scrapped such a structure — a proposed Vatican accountability tribunal — several years ago.

Collins was the headline speaker at a panel discussion on keeping children safe from pedophiles at the World Meeting of Families, a once-every-three-year Vatican-sponsored rally meant to encourage and energize Catholic families. Francis arrives Saturday in Dublin to close out the conference with a Mass on Sunday in Dublin's Phoenix Park.

While the sex abuse crisis was always going to cloud Francis' trip, given Ireland's devastating history of abuse and cover-up, new revelations in the U.S. of misconduct and cover-up by the U.S. hierarchy have ensured that Francis' trip will be dominated by the issue.

Cardinal Sean O'Malley, Francis' top abuse adviser, had been expected to head the Dublin safeguarding discussion Friday but stayed home due to what he called ""serious pastoral needs"" in Boston. O'Malley launched an investigation into his diocesan seminary, and removed its rector, after reports of misconduct went public.

It's the third seminary — including Philadelphia and Seton Hall, New Jersey — that are now under church investigation because of reports of sexual misconduct and possible abuse.

In a letter read out to the conference, O'Malley apologized for not being there in person but made clear he believed that protecting children was the single most important issue facing the Catholic Church today.

""All endeavors at evangelization and other great works will be dependent upon our ability to own our crimes and failings and to make the protection of children and vulnerable adults our No. 1 priority,"" his message read.

Collins, who resigned in frustration from O'Malley's panel last year, was more direct in demanding accountability for abusers and those in the church hierarchy who covered up for them, including at the Vatican.

""Anyone in the Vatican who would stand in the way of proper protection of children should be accountable as well,"" she said. ""This accountability must have strong sanctions for the guilty: Dismissal from their post, removal of their titles and privileges and if necessary, removal from the clergy entirely.""

Collins also said Catholics should ask why the church routinely opposes removing the statute of limitations for victims to prosecute and sue abusers, and yet claims to be on the side of victims. In his letter this week to all the worlds Catholics, Francis insisted that he was ""on the side of victims.""

""The actions of the church do not match the words, and they are in fact totally the opposite,"" Collins said to applause.",world

Spain's center-left government approved Friday legal amendments ensuring that the remains of former dictator Gen. Francisco Franco will be dug up and removed from a controversial national mausoleum honoring its civil war dead.

The minority Socialist government is certain that parliament will endorse the amendments, probably in a debate next month, deputy prime minister Carmen Calvo told a news conference.

The amendments to Spain's Historical Memory Law of 2007 grant the government power to exhume Franco's body. That change aims to thwart legal efforts by Franco's descendants and supporters to block the exhumation in the courts.

Removing Franco's remains from the Valley of the Fallen, a mausoleum he ordered built 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Madrid, would be a momentous event in Spain which still bears social and political scars from the 1936-39 civil war.

The vast Valley of the Fallen complex is most conspicuous public legacy of Franco's rule. It was built by Franco as a tribute to those killed in the 1936-39 civil war when he deposed Spain's democratic government in what he called his ""glorious crusade.""

Some 34,000 people from both sides of the fighting are buried at the site, most of them never identified.

""Having Franco's tomb (at the complex) shows a lack of respect ... for the victims buried there,"" Calvo said. She noted that a visiting United Nations delegation said four years ago that ""democracy is incompatible with a tomb which honors the memory of Franco.""

The Memory Law, which outlawed public events supporting the Franco regime, fell short of addressing the broad demands of civil war survivors and victims' relatives for exhumations and reparations.

Franco's descendants will be consulted and will have 15 days to say where they would like the remains to be placed after exhumation. If they do not reply, the government will choose a ""dignified place,"" Calvo said after the government's weekly Cabinet meeting.

Francisco Martinez-Bordiu, a grandson of Franco, described the exhumation plans as ""barbaric,"" telling Antena 3 in an interview Friday that descendants would assess their legal options for halting it.

An exhumation of Franco's embalmed body — possibly as early as October — would cement the government's reformist and liberal credentials after taking power last June.

Removing Franco from the mausoleum, which is owned and operated by the cultural heritage agency, a public-funded body, has long been discussed in Spain.

Calvo said the government is fast-tracking the exhumation because it wants to ""end a state of affairs which cannot go on any longer.""

At next Friday's Cabinet meeting, the detailed administrative procedures for the exhumation will be set out, she said.

The Valley of the Fallen complex includes a mausoleum and basilica in a neoclassic style and is a popular pilgrimage site for people who are nostalgic for the dictatorship. It has a 150-meter (500-foot)-tall cross that can be seen from many kilometers (miles) away.

Franco, who died in 1975, is in a tomb in the basilica's central nave beneath a 1.5-metric ton tombstone.",world

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out Friday at the European Union over its first financial support package to help bolster Iran's flagging economy, calling it ""a big mistake"" and ""like a poison pill to the Iranian people.""

Speaking on a trip to Lithuania, Netanyahu criticized the EU, which announced Thursday a first tranche of 18 million euros ($21 million), part of the bloc's commitment to keeping the Iran nuclear deal alive.

In May, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from that deal, and began restoring U.S. sanctions. The move has been exacerbating a financial crisis in Iran that has sent its currency tumbling.

""I think that the decision yesterday by the EU to give 18 million euros to Iran is a big mistake. It's like a poison pill to the Iranian people and to the efforts to curb Iranian aggression in the region and beyond the region,"" Netanyahu said.

""Iran attempted to conduct a terror attack on European soil just weeks ago... That is incredible,"" he told a press conference that followed a meeting with three Baltic prime ministers — Lithuanian Saulius Skvernelis, Estonia's Juri Ratas and Maris Kucinskis of Latvia.

Netanyahu was apparently referring to a suspected bomb plot against an Iranian opposition rally in France in late June that was thwarted by authorities. An Iranian diplomat is suspected of involvement.

Earlier, Netanyahu met with Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite who reiterated the EU position that Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory violate international law.

A day earlier, Netanyahu said that Israel was ""often mistreated by the EU,"" adding there were ""many distortions."" Netanyahu, however, welcomed the decision by major international airlines to end their direct flights to Iran's capital, Tehran, in September, after Trump's sanctions move.

Skvernelis said in an interview with the Baltic News Service that after a meeting Thursday with Netanyahu, ""I believe Lithuania really has a better understanding of Israel and that understanding could be spread among other EU countries. ""

""We need to better listen, hear them out and understand their position. We definitely lack a direct dialogue,"" he said.

""But we have to admit that today Israel is not only waging war and defending its independence, the lives of its people, but is also fighting in a wider context, if we speak about terrorism and potential expansion of IS fighters to Europe,"" Skvernelis said.

Netanyahu arrived Thursday in Vilnius on a four-day visit, the first to Lithuania by an Israeli prime minister.

"Alice Marie Johnson, the woman whose life sentence was commuted by President Trump last month, called America “a country of second chances,” and said that she believes Trump will “follow up” with more situations like hers.

Speaking to Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Johnson shared her experience since being released on June 6.

“Every single place that I go, if people recognize who I am, they hug me. They tell me how happy they are that I’m home,” she said. “They tell me how much they were praying for me, and how they followed from the day Kim went to the White House.”

Johnson, 63, had been serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole after she was convicted of a first-time nonviolent drug offense and charges related to money laundering. Reality TV icon Kim Kardashian West took up her case, even meeting with Trump at the White House to plead for clemency.

She said that the most difficult part of her journey was the time spent hoping for a chance to be released.

“The waiting has been very painful for me and my family. We’ve had so many ups and downs. So many false alarms that it was going to happen for years.”

Johnson said that her case is proof that the “system is broken,” but she added that she has faith after being granted clemency by Trump.

“I won’t let him down, there is no way. This country is a country of second chances,” she said on “Hannity.” “I love America, and I believe that as the president sees what has taken place with me, that he is going to follow up and do some other things for other people.”

Johnson also expressed her thanks to West, who has said she is working hard to help others.

“I am so happy that Kim is staying focused, because there are so many others just like me.”

West recently turned down the opportunity to join in Hollywood’s Trump bashing in an appearance with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.

She repeatedly brushed off Kimmel’s remarks aimed at Trump, at one point saying she is “hopeful” that more will come from their meeting at the White House, and that she has “nothing bad to say about the president.”",politics
"President Trump makes so much news that I could write a half-dozen columns today just on his latest comments and tweets—any one of which would lead the news in ordinary times.

Trump says he's willing to meet with the leader of Iran, despite having abandoned the nuclear deal. I'll put that in the category of Not Happening, not least because the Iranians (unlike Kim Jong-un) say they have no interest in sitting down with the president who's squeezing their country with economic sanctions.

Trump says the Koch brothers and their network are a ""total joke"" and ""globalist"" and ""highly overrated."" This is a response to criticism from Charles Koch and some of his donors that the president’s rhetoric is divisive and they don’t back him on tariffs and immigration. But the Kochs were never big Trump fans and didn’t endorse him.

Trump tweeted yesterday that ""the Fake News Media is going CRAZY! They are totally unhinged and in many ways, after witnessing first hand the damage they do to so many innocent and decent people, I enjoy watching."" ""Crazy"" and ""unhinged"" are very strong words, but the president pretty much goes off on the press every day now.

I was not terribly excited when Trump said he would be willing to shut down the government if the Democrats don't give him funding for border security, including the wall. I view this as a negotiating tactic to pressure the other party on a hot-button issue in the midterms. After all, the last government shutdown lasted, what, a few hours?

But it led to a fascinating Wall Street Journal editorial yesterday that questioned whether Trump really cares if Republicans lose the House in November. The brinkmanship, favored by Steve Bannon, might hurt red-state Senate Democrats, but could boomerang in the House, the Journal says.

The editorial argues that the president ""might not fear"" a Democratic House as long as the GOP keeps the Senate: ""Mr. Trump always needs a foil, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi would be from central political casting.""

Sure, a Pelosi-run House ""would mean the end of most of Mr. Trump's agenda."" But he could cut deals with House Democrats on paid family leave, public-works spending and trade protectionism.

And here's the zinger: Even if the House Dems move ahead with impeachment, says the Journal, there would never be a two-thirds Senate majority for conviction. And that could help Trump win reelection if Republicans and independents ""conclude he's the only barrier to a left-wing government led by a President Elizabeth Warren.""

There are plenty of political assumptions baked into this speculation, of course. But the Journal (owned by Rupert Murdoch) is very much running counter to such former Republicans as George Will and Steve Schmidt urging people to vote Democratic this fall to provide a check on a president they despise.

It's true that Bill Clinton thrived (and won reelection) after the Newt Gingrich Republicans captured the House in 1994. And it's true that Trump is at odds with conservative House Republicans on a number of key issues.

But in the end I don't believe that Trump is willing to lose the House in a Machiavellian scheme to propel himself to a second term. House Democrats, even if they're smart enough to avoid impeachment, would make Trump's life miserable with endless hearings, subpoenas and investigations. And they'd play to their base by blocking nearly everything he wants to do.

The president will almost certainly avoid a government shutdown and try to save his House majority, because it would be even harder to win reelection after two years of getting nothing done.",politics
"Special Counsel Robert Mueller has finally responded to a letter from President Trump's outside attorneys about what the scope and format of a potential interview with the president would be, sources familiar with the investigation told Fox News on Wednesday.

The sources said Mueller has agreed to cut the number of questions for Trump from an initial list of 49 and is willing to have some questions answered in writing – though he wants other questions answered orally.

However, the sources added that Mueller has not agreed to the president's demands to limit his questioning to matters related to allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The special prosecutor still wants to ask the president about obstruction of justice and other topics.

The sources also said talks with the special counsel about a possible interview are continuing, but as one source said: ""There is still a long way to go.""

While the Trump legal team's current posture is still not to have the president sit for an interview with Mueller, a source familiar with the investigation told Fox News, “never say never.”

Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, speaking to reporters following an appearance at a Republican congressional campaign event in New Hampshire, said the president's legal team had received ""a letter back"" from the special counsel's team on Tuesday and ""now we're in the process of responding to their proposal.""

""I'm not going to give you a lot of hope it's going to happen,"" Giuliani said of a potential Trump-Mueller sitdown, ""but we're still negotiating.""

On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop Mueller's ""Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further.""

Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation last year, handing off that responsibility to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Trump has asserted previously that Mueller has too many conflicts of interest for him to fairly lead the investigation, citing his ties to fired former FBI Director James Comey as well as what the president called a ""very nasty & contentious business relationship"" in a tweet earlier this week.

Democratic lawmakers said Wednesday that Trump's Sessions tweet amounted to obstruction of justice. But White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the message represented ""the president's opinion"" and not an order to the Justice Department.

""If he wanted to obstruct [the investigation], he'd obstruct it, just end it,"" Giuliani said of Trump in New Hampshire. ""Then you'd all battle whether he has the legal right to do that, which I think he does. But he's not going to do that. He's made it clear he wants it to run its course.""

"His constituents are complaining about the state's crumbling transit system. His own party wants to strip him of gubernatorial powers. The soccer team he owns is living in dire conditions, and one of his sons has been in trouble with the law.

What's a newly elected governor with no experience in elected office to do? He takes a vacation far, far away.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy raised eyebrows last week as he embarked on a swanky 11-day trip to Italy, where he owns a $7 million home he bought during his 23-year stint at Goldman Sachs.

The trip comes just six months after Murphy -- a Democrat and former diplomat under President Barack Obama -- was elected to the top job in the state.

The governor’s office initially declined the reveal where Murphy was going for his holiday, but NJ.com solved the mystery and reported that Italy was the destination. The state’s taxpayers will pick up the tab for protecting the governor while he’s on vacation, with the tab reaching as much as $100,000.

Trouble is, when Murphy returns, New Jersey's problems will still be there waiting for him. Here's a look at some of them.

Broken promises

Despite the governor’s promises in February to ease overcrowding and service issues on New Jersey’s transit system by adding extra rail cars, commuters are complaining that not much progress has been made to actually alleviate the problem.

The plan to add new cars was short-lived. New Jersey leased 10 rail cars from the Maryland Transit Administration to alleviate the overcrowding, but returned them just eight weeks later when the lease ended.

""If my Uber bill this summer is any measure of success, improvement would not be the term I would use."" - New Jersey commuter Niklaus Gunter

“What relief plans? I haven't seen any relief,” one commuter told NJ.com.

“If my Uber bill this summer is any measure of success, improvement would not be the term I would use,” commuter Niklaus Gunter seconded. (Users of NJ Transit often wind up paying for cab or Uber/Lyft rides when their trains and buses fail to show up as scheduled.)

For what it's worth, the NJ Tranist system appears to continue to crumble, with nearly a dozen trains getting canceled on Tuesday morning alone, infuriating commuters. NJ Transit at first offered no explanation, but later vaguely said the installation and testing of a rail safety system called Positive Train Control (PTC) and lack of staff were the reasons for cancellations.

“NJ Transit has taken steps to address these issues by recruiting and training additional locomotive engineers. We anticipate a class graduating within the next couple of weeks that will add nine engineers to the roster,” the statement from NJ Transit reads.

“In addition, we have increased the number of current classes from two to four, running concurrently with staggered graduation dates, to continue the qualification of new engineers,” it added.

Power strip?

The New Jersey governor’s struggles to solve issues may also embolden already existing calls from within his own party to strip him of powers when it comes to deciding how much money various taxes and programs should raise each year, NorthJersey.com reported.

The power to set revenue estimates is crucial as it determines how much the state will need to hike taxes to fund spending priorities. Democrats suggest the role should be shifted to a three-member panel consisting of experts, a move that they say would take politics out of budget calculations and increase transparency.

But Murphy has fought back against the proposal, saying it would upset the balance of power between him and the legislative branch of the state government.

“New Jersey’s Constitution carefully divides the authority in the budgetary process between the Legislature, who has the power to appropriate funds, and the Executive, who has the authority to certify revenues,” Murphy spokesman Dan Bryan said in a statement to the outlet.

“Unlike his predecessor, Governor Murphy is committed to certifying revenues that are realistic, responsible, and sustainable, and feels that it is unwise to disrupt the separation of powers that has existed in this area for over 70 years.”

Soccer team under scrutiny

Closer to home, Murphy is also facing questions about a professional women’s soccer team he co-owns. The club, called Sky Blue FC, faces allegations that it’s mismanaged and provides poor living conditions and subpar facilities to its players.

""Some players were forced to live with an elderly man who repeatedly made inappropriate comments to the players and made them feel uncomfortable."" - The Equalizer report on Murphy's soccer team.

The team's players include U.S. women's World Cup star Carli Lloyd.

The governor bought the team a decade ago as a way to impress his daughter. According to NJTV, he “has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in this losing proposition” just so “his daughter, who plays soccer, could see that women can play soccer at the professional level as well.”

But the club’s training facilities lacked locker rooms or even running water, the Equalizer reported. The players have had to use portable restrooms and have worn dirty gear during practices because there are barely any laundry services.

Another report, published by the soccer news site Once A Metro, detailed the mismanagement of the team and how little interest Murphy actually has taken in it, though it has cost him nearly half a million dollars in recent years.

The report alleges the club failed to provide decent housing for some players, forcing them to sleep on couches, and use sheets of cardboard to cover broken windows. The Equalizer reported as well that “some players were forced to live with an elderly man who repeatedly made inappropriate comments to the players and made them feel uncomfortable.”

Murphy admitted that the conditions weren't acceptable and said the team deserved better treatment. “I don't find the status quo tolerable — and these players deserve better,” he said in a statement, according to NorthJersey.com. “They deserve to operate in a professional and supportive environment so they can do what they do best — play the game, inspire fans, and build community through the power of the world's most popular sport.”

Troublemaker son

But Murphy's rough six-month reign as governor isn’t his only headache. His 20-year-old son, Joshua Murphy, who relentlessly campaigned for him during the 2017 election, had multiple run-ins with the law since Murphy’s rise to prominence.

In June, prosecutors dismissed a complaint concerning the governor’s son, NJ.com reported. He faced charges of underage drinking and disorderly conduct as he allegedly shouted obscenities at a campus police officer on Halloween as he was partying with two young women. According to police, Joshua Murphy ended the night on the ground in handcuffs.

In February, the son drove off a steep slope in Connecticut, the outlet reported, citing police records. His SUV was found by a motorist. According to police reports, Murphy said he crashed the car at early morning and he was unable to contact anyone for help because his phone didn’t work after the crash.

The governor and his wife lashed out against the media for reporting about his son’s endeavors, saying Joshua “has been living a nightmare” thanks to media inquiries.",politics
"Non-American citizens are increasingly found on voter rolls thanks to covert registration methods, with nothing actually stopping them from casting a ballot in an election.

Elizaveta Shuvalova, a Russian citizen who became a U.S. citizen only last year, was registered as an eligible voter in 2012 and added to the San Francisco voter rolls, the Washington Times reported.

She was perplexed to find herself in the voter rolls, saying she wasn’t an American citizen and didn’t even register to vote.

“I’ve never registered for anything in my entire life,” Shuvalova told the paper. “This is news to me.”

“I’ve never registered for anything in my entire life. This is news to me.” - Elizaveta Shuvalova, who became a U.S. citizen in 2017, but has been on voter rolls since 2012

The woman’s voter log shows that she signed up as a Democrat in July 2012. In 2016, her registration was canceled after she informed election authorities that she wasn't eligible to vote because she wasn't yet a U.S. citizen.

“This is definitely a shocker to me. It is like an identity fraud because this is not coming from my end,” the woman, who identifies as a Democrat, said. “Like I told you, I haven’t even been a citizen during that time frame. So what can we do about it?”

NON-CITIZENS, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NOW MAY REGISTER TO VOTE IN SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS

But the case of Shuvalova is part of a larger concern some groups have when it comes integrity of elections. They claim that stories like hers are a common occurence in many parts of the country.

The Public Interest Legal Foundation, a nonprofit specializing in election integrity, found that non-Americans are being added to voter rolls in states such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia.

The group says that a large portion of the non-citizens even managed to cast their ballots in elections as well. For instance, in 2017, the group found that nearly 5,600 people on the voter rolls in Virginia were deemed as non-citizens, with a third of them voting in previous elections.

""Our voter registration system masks non-citizens and allows the opportunity to vote until they decide to self-report at their own peril. All of this could have been prevented if states actually verified citizen eligibility upfront."" - PILF research director Logan Churchwell

“Our voter registration system masks non-citizens and allows the opportunity to vote until they decide to self-report at their own peril. All of this could have been prevented if states actually verified citizen eligibility upfront,” Logan Churchwell, communications and research director for the foundation, told the Times.

Shuvalova could have been added on voter rolls after signing a 2013 petition for a ballot initiative concerning housing development in San Francisco.

John Arntz, director of the San Francisco Department of Elections, told the Times that a signed registration card was submitted to the office to qualify the woman as a signer of the petition. He added that activists often distribute registration cards along with their petitions.

Normally, election authorities should check the registration application with other databases such as the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles and the secretary of state’s office to ensure the person is a citizen.

In Shuvalova’s case, however, she wasn’t detected as a non-citizen and she began receiving voting ballots. She received nine of them, but never actually voted. She reportedly returned one ballot in 2016 but only to inform officials that she wasn't a citizen and therefore wasn't eligible to vote.

The San Francisco election official said that Shuvalova could have easily gotten away with voting in elections before 2016 and she probably would have remained on the voter rolls as an eligible voter had she not informed officials.

But Arntz told the Times that the woman’s story isn’t a reflection on whole the integrity of the election system.

“If it was a problem, this would be an issue that comes up every election or something we would have experienced more through time. But it doesn’t,” he said.

"Well, that escalated quickly.

The rise of “democratic socialism” has been one of the key developments in the Democratic Party in recent years, first with the popularity of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and more recently Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s primary win over party mainstay Rep. Joe Crowley in New York.



One of the ways the movement is presented is with the claim that this is not your grandfather’s socialism -- or the socialism of the former Soviet Union, Venezuela or other failed states. It’s more “Scandinavian health care” than overthrowing the bourgeoisie.



But now a democratic socialist writer is leveling with voters, telling them that actually, yes, they want to topple capitalism.

""I’m a staff writer at the socialist magazine Jacobin and a member of [the Democratic Socialists of America], and here’s the truth: In the long run, democratic socialists want to end capitalism.



In an article for Vox, Meagan Day, a writer for the socialist magazine Jacobin and a democratic socialist, says the goal is to pursue a “reform agenda today in an effort to revive a politics focused on class hierarchy and inequality in the United States.”



“The eventual goal is to transform the world to promote everyone’s needs rather than to produce massive profits for a small handful of citizens,” she says.

OBAMA SNUBS OCASIO-CORTEZ IN ENDORSEMENT LIST

Day goes on to reject the idea that democratic socialism is just a modern form of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal, as some have suggested.



“But we also want more than FDR did. A robust welfare state in an economy that’s still organized around capitalists’ profits can mitigate the worst inequalities for a while, but it’s at best a temporary truce between bosses and workers — and one that the former will look to scrap as soon as they can,” she argues.



In the meantime, she argues that the goals of democratic socialists should be to go and fight battles that will eventually rally people together to fight what she calls “the capitalist Goliaths currently in charge of our society.”

The article comes after a rough few days for democratic socialists. Ocasio-Cortez was widely criticized for an interview with ""The Daily Show"" where she struggled to lay out exactly how she’d fund her agenda.



A new study found that the “Medicare for All” plan pushed by Sanders, and endorsed by a host of Democratic congressional and presidential hopefuls, would increase government health care spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years.



On Wednesday, former President Barack Obama issued a list of midterm endorsements -- a list which notably did not include Ocasio-Cortez.

"The Trump administration on Thursday moved to freeze fuel economy standards in what officials described as an effort to give drivers access to “safer” and “more affordable” vehicles, in the latest swipe at former President Barack Obama's legacy.

The proposal comes just one day after the Trump administration announced major changes to health plans, providing consumers with more options to buy cheaper, short-term health insurance.

The Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency proposed the vehicle change as the first formal step in setting new standards for model years 2021 through 2026. The plan would freeze the Obama-era requirements set to take effect after 2020.

“There are compelling reasons for a new rulemaking on fuel economy standards for 2021-2026,” Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao said in a statement Thursday. “More realistic standards will promote a healthy economy by bringing newer, safer, cleaner and more fuel-efficient vehicles to U.S. roads and we look forward to receiving input from the public.”

The administration also filed notice Thursday that it wants to revoke the authority of California and other states to set their own, stricter mileage standards -- independent of federal ones.

Acting EPA Director Andrew Wheeler said the change would strike a balance.

“Our proposal aims to strike the right regulatory balance based on the most recent information and create a 50-state solution that will enable more Americans to afford, newer, safer vehicles that pollute less,” Wheeler said in a statement. “More realistic standards can save lives while continuing to improve the environment.”

The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the administration supports freezing the mileage standards after 2020, but would seek public comment now on that proposal and a range of others, including leaving the tighter, Obama administration fuel standards in place.

The current standards, according to the Department of Transportation, have been a factor in the rising costs of new cars to an average of $35,000 or more, which they argue is “out of reach” for most American families.

AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE IS HERE: HHS SEC ALEX AZAR

Keeping the current standards in place, which were finalized in 2012, would add $2,340 to the cost of owning a new car, and would impose more than $500 billion in costs to the economy over the next 50 years, according to the Department of Transportation.

The Trump administration argued that the “ever-increasing” vehicle fuel efficiency standards have a negative effect on highway safety.

“Cars are more expensive, and if cars are more expensive, people buy fewer new cars,” EPA Assistant Administrator Bill Wherum told reporters Thursday, explaining that people are driving older cars as opposed to new “cleaner” and more efficient vehicles. “That translates into higher fatalities and injuries on the road due to accidents.”

The Department of Transportation and the EPA estimated that the rule could save 1,000 lives annually.

Immediately following the announcement, New York's Democratic Attorney General Barbara Underwood, part of a coalition of 20 other attorneys general, threatened to take the administration to court.

""Freezing or weakening these standards puts the health of our children, seniors, and all communities at risk, and increases the rising costs of climate change for our states,"" Underwood said in a statement. ""This decision upends decades of cooperative state and federal action to protect our residents. We are prepared to go to court to put the brakes on this reckless and illegal plan.”

Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, called the proposed rule ""a massive pileup of bad ideas"" that would increase pollution and raise fuel costs for consumers.

He said in a statement that the organization would challenge the administration's action ""in the court of public opinion and the court of law.""

The proposed rule is the most recent Trump administration effort to roll back Obama-era policies. On Wednesday, the administration’s short-term health insurance plan provided an option to consumers separate from ObamaCare.

The plans would last up to 12 months and can be renewed for up to 36 months, with premiums reaching just one-third of comprehensive, full coverage. The plan is geared to Americans who want an individual health insurance policy, but who make too much money to qualify for ObamaCare subsidies.

Democrats blasted the short term policy as ""junk insurance"" on Wednesday, suggesting the plan would raise premiums for sick Americans and put people at risk.

Despite the new plan, the Trump administration has yet to fully repeal ObamaCare, as candidate-Trump and so many Republicans promised on the campaign trail.

But last year, as part of the GOP tax overhaul, Trump successfully repealed the individual mandate penalty--which was the linchpin of Obama’s signature health care law. The individual mandate required Americans to buy insurance or face a penalty. Official estimates predict that 4 million more people would be uninsured when the mandate repeal takes effect, and that 13 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2027.

Trump has also successfully scrapped other massive policies and agreements made under the Obama administration.

Last year, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, which was negotiated by Obama, and earlier this year, Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal.

"House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wants Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to testify before Congress on the “censorship” of conservatives amid allegations the social media platform is “shadow banning” prominent Republicans.

The California Republican, in a letter to House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden on Thursday, said Twitter’s practices have “targeted conservatives disproportionately.”

He requested a public committee hearing with Dorsey so “the American people can learn more about the filtering and censorship practices on his platform.”

“Recently we learned that Twitter limited the visibility of certain conservative accounts, so that some of their tweets did not appear in searches and their accounts were more difficult to find through the search feature,” McCarthy wrote. “This ‘shadow ban’ made it harder for users to get information about certain public officials—or even to learn that their social media presence existed.”

TWITTER SLAMMED FOR ‘SHADOW BANNING’ PROMINENT REPUBLICANS

Twitter has come under fire after Republican Party chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, several conservative Republican congressmen, including California Rep. Devin Nunes, and others, failed to appear in its auto-populated drop-down search results.

In light of the controversy, Twitter denied that it shadow bans, claiming that the problem is the result of an algorithmic glitch in the search function that is being fixed.

“It's based on who you follow,” Dorsey said this week on Fox News Radio. “It's based on who you engage with. It's not based on decisions that we make.”

But Republicans, like McCarthy, say they aren’t satisfied with the explanations.

“Twitter ultimately implemented a change to stop penalizing conservatives, but serious questions remain about how and why the company filters content on its platform,” McCarthy said.

Social media giants such as Twitter and Facebook are under increasing scrutiny, particularly in the wake of a government probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

"For months, Palestinian militants have been sending balloons and kites rigged with incendiary devices (some bearing swastikas) over the border from the Gaza Strip to Israel -- causing devastation to land, crops and livelihoods.



Now Israel is calling out the United Nations for allegedly ignoring such attacks as it focuses on Israel instead.



As part of a broader effort to bring attention to the attacks, Israel’s Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon opened up an exhibit at U.N. headquarters showing the devastation from the recent attacks.

“We follow very carefully what's happening in Israel, and unfortunately people don’t get it at the U.N. when we speak about the fact they have more than 7,000 acres that have been set on fire -- that’s half the size of Manhattan,” Danon told Fox News on Thursday.

'They have more than 7,000 acres that have been set on fire -- that’s half the size of Manhattan.' - Ambassador Danny Danon

Israel says more than 700 fires have been caused by the attacks, resulting in millions of dollars in damage to farms and businesses. One recent balloon landed in the yard of a kindergarten, though there were no injuries.



The images on display at the U.N., captured by local photographers, include one of a tractor surrounded by flames as a farmer watches his crops go up in smoke.



But while the U.N. waxes lyrical about environmental protection and the importance of conservation, food security and non-violence, Danon says key bodies have been silent on this issue.



“No one will speak about it. That's what I feel in the Security Council, in the General Assembly, so we set up this exhibition here to allow ambassadors to understand it,” Danon said, adding that he asks ambassadors who visit what they would do if 7,000 acres of their homeland were set on fire by terrorists.



“I ask them, ‘What would you do if this happened in your country?’”



Danon also noted the presence of a large sign outside the exhibit: “The holding of the exhibit in U.N. premises does not imply endorsement by the United Nations.”



Farhan Haq, a spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told Fox News that the U.N. Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohamed had received a letter about the subject from Israel, and that U.N. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov has visited Gaza and called for such attacks to cease.

Guterres has also called on ""Hamas and other Palestinian militants to cease the launching of rockets and incendiary kites and provocations"" but also urged Israel to ""exercise restraint to avoid further inflaming the situation.""



Both Israel and the U.S. have been ramping up pressure on the international body to rid itself of anti-Israel bias and call out terrorist acts by groups like Hamas and Hezbollah by name. With Ambassador Nikki Haley taking the reins at the U.S. mission last year, combating anti-Israel bias has become a top U.S. priority.



The U.S. has in recent months pulled out of the Human Rights Council and slashed funding to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA). Last month, Haley blasted Arab countries who make anti-Israel speeches but don’t commit funding to help the Palestinian cause.



“If those words were useful in the schools, the hospitals, and the streets of their communities, the Palestinian people would not be facing the desperate conditions we are discussing here today,” she said on the floor of the Security Council. “But talk is cheap.”



Haley also mentioned what she called the “terrorist flaming swastika kites” and agreed with Danon: “If it was happening to any of our countries, there would be quite a lot of discussion on it.”



The U.S. and Israel have been attempting a new tactic at the U.N., namely inserting language into anti-Israel resolutions that directly condemns Hamas. This had some success in a recent motion on the floor of the General Assembly, where an amendment condemning Hamas picked up a slim 62-58 majority.

HALEY PRESSURES ARAB STATES TO STEP UP ON PALESTINIAN AID: 'WE ARE NOT FOOLS'



“My team together with Ambassador Haley and her team, we will insist on that. When you need to name Hezbollah you will name Hezbollah, even if we vote on it and lose it, we will insist on that. Same with Hamas, so you cannot say we condemn acts of violence without saying who is responsible for that,” Danon said.



While other motions have failed, Danon said he has a good relationship with Haley, as well as an open dialogue with Guterres, and there are signs of a paradigm shift at the U.N.



“I think we are successful in changing the rules of the game ... and we are starting to feel that change,” he said.

"Vice President Mike Pence spoke at a ceremony Wednesday to mark the arrival of the remains of U.S. servicemen from the Korean War -- and joining him were two guests who lost their fathers in the war.

Pence took to Twitter Wednesday to share that he and his wife Karen would attend the ceremony in Honolulu with Diana Brown Sanfilippo and Rick Downes.

The vice president said that when Sanfilippo was 4 years old she lost her father in the Korean War during a recon mission, and that when Downes was just 3 years old he lost his father operating radar on a B-26 bomber.

Pence later wrote he was “humbled & honored” to be a part of the repatriations ceremony.

North Korea handed over the remains of what U.S. officials said are believed to be the remains of U.S servicemen who fought during the Korean War. A U.S. military plane made a rare trip into North Korea to retrieve 55 cases.

Fox News’ Pete Hegseth, who was traveling with Pence in Air Force Two, recalled the touching stories of the heroes' now-grown children.

“We picked up probably the two most important passengers on that plane: a man and woman who were 4 and 3 years old — little girl and little boy in the 1950s — when they sent their fathers, then young men, both pilots, both first lieutenants, both went to fight in the Korean War,” he said on “Fox & Friends.”

“They dedicated their lives for the last 60 years finding out what happened to their fathers, what happened though those patriots, warriors who went to fight for us, for every generation of Americans,” Hegseth continued.

The returned remains are seen as one major accomplishment of Trump’s historic summit in Singapore with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un last month.",politics
"As President Trump has traveled across the country this week, a number of spectators have been spotted holding up giant cutouts of the letter Q and wearing T-shirts with the hashtag, #WeAreQ.

So who are they?

Under the radar until now, they are members of the fringe, right-wing group QAnon which believes in massive conspiracies in the media and the so-called “deep state” to take down Trump.

The group “is just hitting the right audience at the right time given the right circumstance,” Joseph Uscinski, a University of Miami professor who co-authored the book “American Conspiracy Theories,” told The Associated Press. He said the topics appeal to many who are already inclined to believe conspiracy theories.

Read on for a look at what QAnon is, and why it’s been in the news lately.

What does the group believe?

There are several conspiracy theories this group has latched on to, especially the belief there is a network of people, including in the U.S. government, that wants to take down Trump and his administration, according to The New York Times.

Another theory, according to NPR, is that Special Counsel Robert Mueller isn’t actually investigating allegations of Russian interference and collusion in the 2016 election. Rather, the former FBI director is looking into prominent Democrats — including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, Trump’s 2016 opponent — and their relationship with Russia or potential connections to a massive (unsubstantiated) pedophile ring.

Another belief is the military asked Trump to run for president in order to deal with the nefarious group of people in government, according to NPR.

The group also has its own lingo. Aside from calling the leader simply ""Q,"" they refer to those who attempt to debunk the group and its theories as “clowns,” and those who follow along as “bakers.""

How did it get started?

According to The Associated Press, an anonymous person posted on the online messaging website 4chan in October 2017 claiming to have a high-level government security clearance — a ""Q clearance,"" to be exact — and discussed Trump, Obama, Clinton, political donor George Soros and others. The message was titled, “The Calm Before the Storm,” which many believe to be a reference to a meeting Trump had with military leaders earlier that month when he used the same phrase.

The poster, ""Q,"" leaves what are called “breadcrumbs,” or clues for followers to decipher to figure out the conspiracy theories.

It’s unclear who ""Q"" actually is, and if he or she is just one person or a group.

Why is it making headlines now?

People holding signs or wearing apparel referencing QAnon have started showing up at Trump rallies and other political events in recent months.

A group marched to the Department of Justice in protest in April 2018. And a 30-year-old man was arrested for alleged terrorist acts, among other things, after he blocked a highway near the Hoover Dam with his armored truck, calling for the release of a Justice Department report pertaining to Clinton’s email server, WTVR reported. The man involved in that June incident is believed to have been associated with QAnon.

Roseanne Barr, the embattled actress whose namesake show was canceled this year after she tweeted racist sentiments about a former Obama administration official, has also apparently retweeted messages from its Twitter account and asked to make contact with the leader.

In June, she also tweeted the phrase “wwg1wga,” which NPR translated as “where we go one, we go all,"" a common phrase among supporters.

Anything else to know about the group?

It looks for validation, especially in the number 17, which coincides with where Q is in the alphabet.

For example, the University of Alabama national champion football team gave Trump a jersey with the number 17 on it earlier this year when it visited the White House. As The New York Times reported, some who adhere to the Q group believe it’s a symbol that it exists; others online believe it shows Trump, himself, is ""Q.""

"One of President Trump's most vocal critics in the U.S. Senate said Friday that he once cried “tears of rage” over the Trump administration’s rhetoric.

U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., made the remark at the Netroots Nation Conference in New Orleans, where other liberal speakers were to include U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

The annual convention drew thousands of liberal activists and offered a chance for Democrats considering presidential runs to win over supporters, the Washington Times reported.

“I’m a big believer that if America, if this country hasn’t broken your heart, then you don’t love her enough,"" Booker continued. ""Because there’s things that are savagely wrong in this country.”

“I’m a big believer that if America, if this country hasn’t broken your heart, then you don’t love her enough. Because there’s things that are savagely wrong in this country.” - U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.

One place where Booker claimed to have had his heart broken was Newark, N.J., the struggling Northeast city -- with poverty and crime rates typically among the nation's highest -- where Booker served as mayor from 2006 to 2013.

“Newark has gifted me a wisdom that can only come from wounds, a sense of purpose that can only come from shared pain,” Booker said, according to the Times. “It’s a city that at times where my heart has been broken but I’ve learned that the heart is this interesting organ that, it’s the only one that really works even if it’s gotten broken.”

“Newark has gifted me a wisdom that can only come from wounds, a sense of purpose that can only come from shared pain.” - U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.

Booker also lamented for a Democratic Party that, in his view, seems ""to have lost our way.""

“I think a lot about the Democratic Party nationally and how it seems that that connection to people — where they are, what their experiences are, their struggles, their hurts and their pain — how we seem to have lost our way,” he said.

Anti-Israel sign?

Booker's spokesman, Jeff Giertz, later found himself doing damage control because of a sign that the senator held up during a photo shoot with some attendees of the same New Orleans conference.

The attendees turned out to be activists from the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, a group that advocates for “anti-racism principles,” according to its website.

The sign Booker held said “From Palestine to Mexico, all the walls have got to go,” raising the eyebrows of pro-Israel supporters.

Giertz told the Washington Free Beacon that the senator didn’t have time to read the sign “amid the rush” and thought it was only talking about Mexico.

Giertz added that Booker does believe security barriers are necessary as long as ""active terrorist organizations threaten the safety of the people living in Israel.""

Last week, Booker implored activists to “please, get up in the face of some congresspeople,” at the National Conference on Ending Homelessness in Washington D.C., Fox News Insider previously reported.

He also joined senior members of Senate last week to oppose Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying “you are either complicit in the evil … or you are fighting against it,” Fox News Insider also previously reported.",politics
"President Trump on Saturday campaigned in Ohio for Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson ahead of a special House election next week, saying the Democratic opponent is controlled by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and favors open borders.

Running against the Trump-backed candidate is Democrat Danny O’Connor. Earlier Saturday, the president described O'Connor in a tweet as “a puppet” for Pelosi, “weak on Crime, Borders & your 2nd Amendment,” with a goal of raising taxes.

Before welcoming Balderson onstage, Trump described him as “really smart” and “a really hard worker” who would “fight for Ohio.”

Balderson promised to “fight alongside” the president on a variety of issues, and dubbed his opponent “Dishonest Danny O’Connor.”

“Dishonest Danny O’Connor wants to repeal those middle-class tax cuts. Dishonest Danny O’Connor wants to take away your guns. Dishonest Danny supports open borders and sanctuary cities,” Balderson argued. “Dishonest Danny O’Connor will fight against the policies that are turning our country around. And worst of all, Dishonest Danny O’Connor will vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker.”

PRESIDENT TRUMP TO HOLD RALLY IN OHIO AHEAD OF CRUCIAL SPECIAL ELECTION

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, also briefly took the stage during the rally at the request of the president, and was met with chants from the crowd supporting him for the House speakership.

Jordan, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, announced July 26 that he plans to mount an anti-establishment run for speaker, if Republicans keep control of the chamber.

Echoing Balderson’s comments, Trump told the crowd that a vote for O’Connor “is a vote for open borders, which equals massive crime.”

Before describing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as “brave” and “fantastic for this country,” Trump said that abolishing the agency has become a goal for Democrats.

“A vote for Danny boy and the Democrats is a vote to let criminals and drugs pour into our country,” Trump said. “And to let MS-13 run wild in our communities. And you know what they do once they’re there.”

Trump mentioned Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., earlier, asserting that she was “a seriously low IQ person.”

"At his rally in central Ohio on Saturday night, President Trump took aim at U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, criticizing the longtime member of the Senate Intelligence Committee for reportedly having a suspected Chinese spy on her staff in the past.

“The leader of the Russia investigation, Dianne Feinstein, had a Chinese spy as her driver for 20 years,” Trump said about California’s senior U.S. senator, the Washington Times reported. “And she’s leading the Russian ‘witch hunt.’ Isn’t that something? And then she says to me, ‘What did you know about this and that?’ Give me a break.”

“The leader of the Russia investigation, Dianne Feinstein, had a Chinese spy as her driver for 20 years. And she’s leading the Russian ‘witch hunt.’ Isn’t that something? And then she says to me, ‘What did you know about this and that?’ Give me a break.” - President Donald Trump, at a rally in Ohio on Saturday

The president’s remarks continued a feud that Trump had begun on Twitter on Friday night, when he reacted to reports of the Feinstein story.

“Dianne is the person leading our Nation on ‘Collusion’ with Russia (only done by Dems),” the president tweeted. “Will she now investigate herself?”

Feinstein retaliated with a pair of tweets Saturday.

“The FBI told me 5 years ago it had concerns that China was seeking to recruit an administrative member of my Calif staff (despite no access to sensitive information),” Feinstein wrote in the first message. “I took those concerns seriously, learned the facts and made sure the employee left my office immediately.

“Compare that to your actions: attacking the FBI and refusing the advice of your national security team. SAD! I appreciated then and now the diligent work of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies and acted in the best interests of the country. Give it a try!”

Earlier in the week, Politico and other outlets reported that Feinstein learned from the FBI about five years ago that a staffer in her San Francisco office was suspected of delivering political intelligence, though nothing top secret, to officials at the local Chinese Consulate.

Feinstein was said to have been “mortified” when she learned the news, according to Politico.

The FBI wasn’t able to charge the individual, but Feinstein “forced him to retire,” a source told the San Francisco Chronicle.

In Ohio, Trump used the Feinstein story as an example that other countries besides Russia are engaged in espionage against the United States.

“Not only China, it’s a lot of people,” Trump said, according to the Washington Times. “And we’ve got to stop it. We’ve got to stop meddling, we’ve got to stop everybody from attacking us. But there are a lot. Russia’s there, China’s there. We’re doing well with North Korea, but they’re probably there [spying]. We’ve got to stop everybody.

“And I like Dianne Feinstein. But I don’t like the fact that she had a Chinese spy driving her, and she didn’t know it.”

Earlier this year, Trump blasted “sneaky Dianne Feinstein” after the Democrat released the transcript of a congressional interview with the co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the anti-Trump dossier, claiming the move was “possibly” illegal.

“The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!” Trump tweeted in January.

Trump’s visit Saturday to Lewis Center, Ohio, was mostly about supporting state Sen. Troy Balderson, a Republican looking to win a special election for a U.S. House seat this coming Tuesday.

"Judge Brett Kavanaugh views Roe v. Wade as ""settled law,"" U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Tuesday after meeting with President Trump's Supreme Court pick. But abortion rights activists and Democrats remained unconvinced that Kavanaugh won't try to restrict abortion access from the bench.

In a two-hour meeting, Collins said Kavanaugh told her he agrees with Chief Justice John Roberts, who called the 1973 Roe v. Wade case that legalized abortion ""settled law"" during his confirmation hearings in 2005.

""We talked at great length about precedent and the application of stare decisis to abortion cases,"" Collins said, using the legal term for settled precedent.

Kavanaugh's views on abortion are of major importance to Collins, who has vowed to oppose Kavanaugh's nomination if shows ""demonstrated hostility"" toward Roe v. Wade.

Collins described their discussion as ""productive"" and ""informative,"" but said she would not decide how to vote until after the Senate Judiciary Committee holds confirmation hearings on Kavanaugh next month.

Meanwhile, Ilsye Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement that Collins should not be reassured by Kavanaugh about abortion issues, CentralMaine.com reported.

“With all due respect to Senator Collins, ‘settled law’ means nothing. It is a bunch of code words, long used by many conservative judges, meant to hide their real beliefs and anti-choice record."" - Ilsye Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America

“With all due respect to Senator Collins, ‘settled law’ means nothing,"" Hogue said. ""It is a bunch of code words, long used by many conservative judges, meant to hide their real beliefs and anti-choice record.""

Hogue added that the current Supreme Court, led by Roberts, ""has spent much of the last term re-litigating so-called ‘settled law.’""

""Most troubling of all is Senator Collins’ reference to Roberts today,"" she said. ""Roberts has voted in lockstep with anti-abortion forces on every vote since joining the court.”

Democrats fighting Kavanaugh's ascension to the high court sought to keep up the pressure, dismissing Kavanaugh's stance on Roe v. Wade as an artful dodge.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., met with Kavanaugh later Tuesday. He said the judge refused to answer when asked directly whether Roe. V. Wade was correctly decided.

That lack of clarity, Schumer said, should ""send shivers down the spine of any American who believes in reproductive freedom for women.""

Schumer added that Kavanaugh has a special obligation to be forthcoming on abortion, given Trump's ""litmus test that he would only appoint judges who would overturn Roe.""

Kavanaugh has already met with most Senate Republicans, but winning support from Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, could be crucial. Both senators support access to abortion services.

Collins has never opposed a Supreme Court nominee, CentralMaine.com reported.

Several Democratic female senators joined with advocates for women's health care Tuesday to talk about the stakes of adding Kavanaugh to the court, particularly when it comes to access to abortion services.

""This is a wakeup call,"" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. ""Do not take this moment lightly.""

But Republicans still hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by the start of the court's session on Oct. 1.

"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired back at President Trump on Wednesday, saying the president should focus on other matters instead of badmouthing his city.

The mayor was quick to allude to Trump's mounting legal troubles one day after the president assailed Chicago's crime rate and immigration policies at a Tuesday night rally in West Virginia.

“First of all, we'll always be a welcoming city, because Chicago welcomed my grandfather, etc. But let me just say one thing, if I were Donald Trump, I’d spend my time figuring out which attorney I’m going to have,” Emanuel told Fox 32 Chicago.

One night earlier, Trump took jabs at Chicago's status as a high-crime city that also served as a sanctuary for immigrants.

""Take a look at Chicago. How about the mayor of Chicago? It's like a war zone. This is what those policies do,"" Trump said at the rally.

Chicago is known to have the some of the nation's most violent neighborhoods, with nearly 60 people shot and four people killed last weekend alone, Fox News reported.

But a researcher told Fox 32 that violence in the city's ""war zones"" is ""virtually all carried out by native-born Americans"" rather than immigrants.

Emanuel, meanwhile, was apparently preaching to the Democratic choir: A new survey showed that 70 percent of Cook County residents have an unfavorable view of Trump, the station reported.

Trump and Emanuel have a history of trading barbs.

In July, after Trump's Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Emanuel called for Trump's security clearance to be taken away, the Chicago Tribune reported.

“I don’t know if I’ve ever thought this, but I did yesterday: Can you actually take away a president’s security clearance, since they shouldn’t be getting intel from the intel community?” Emanuel said, criticizing Trump's performance at the summit. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Amid Chicago's crime problems, Emanuel faces building pressure to take action or resign, the report said.

He also reportedly came under fire for comments that linked the city's violence to the moral character of people in some ethnic neighborhoods.",politics
"WASHINGTON— Nancy Pelosi is the chief villain of Republican campaign ads. The leader some Democrats promise to vote against. The subject of much speculation that her grip on power is coming to an end.

Nevertheless, she says she’s not going anywhere — and certainly not while President Donald Trump is in the White House.

“This is not anything to make a big fuss over, it’s politics,” Pelosi said in a 35-minute phone interview with The Associated Press. “I can take the heat and that’s why I stay in the kitchen.”

Pushing back on those who say her leadership position is in jeopardy, Pelosi all but dared her doubters to envision any other House Democrat sitting across the table to negotiate with Trump.

“I have a following in the country that’s unsurpassed by anybody, unless they’re running for president,” Pelosi said.

Trump and the Republicans are eager to see her go, she said, “and I’m just not going to let them do that.”

With Democrats bullish about winning back the House majority, Pelosi is already beginning to lay out a detailed early-days agenda that could be set in motion come January. Beyond cleaning up corruption, lowering health care costs and providing bigger paychecks, Pelosi told AP the Democrats would push forward legislation on background checks for gun purchases and legal status for young immigrants brought to this country illegally, often referred to as “Dreamers.”

“We’re ready,” she said.

Yet Pelosi’s return to the speakership, if Democrats triumph, is far from assured.

Dozens of Democrats — candidates and a few lawmakers — are saying they may not back her, creating an unprecedented groundswell for new leadership.

“I think we’re in different territory now,” said Rep. Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who won about one-third of the Democrats during a private caucus vote when he mounted a symbolic challenge against Pelosi two years ago. “It’s time to turn the page.”

But Pelosi has faced uprisings from the ranks before, most notably after Democrats lost control of the House after the tea party Republican wave of 2010. Anyone who is counting her out — and many are trying to show her to the exits— may be underestimating her staying power.

“It’s immodest of me to say, but I say to women now, ‘Just go for it.’ Tell them why you think you’re the best person to do this job,” she said. “I want to be an example to them, just to say, ‘Don’t run away from a fight.’ If you think you’re the one that should be there, you make the fight.”

It’s not that other Democrats haven’t tried to replace her. Pelosi’s top lieutenant, Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, has long coveted the top job, waiting out Pelosi for his moment to hold the gavel. He has been promoting himself to colleagues as a “bridge” to the next generation of leadership.

Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn of South Carolina let it be known recently that he, too, is willing to take the helm if Pelosi falls short, lawmakers said. That prospect is appealing to many Democrats, as he would be the first African-American speaker.

And younger lawmakers, including the 45-year-old Ryan, have not shut the door on running. Some say it’s time for a clean sweep, and that replacing 78-year-old Pelosi with 79-year-old Hoyer or 78-year-old Clyburn is not the generational change that the Democratic caucus wants.

“A lot of new people have come in and said, ‘Look, do I have to be here 30 years before I insert myself into the leadership group?’ ” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., who sees Clyburn’s potential bid as particularly influential in putting votes from the Congressional Black Caucus in play. The chairman of the CBC, Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., is likely to support Clyburn if he runs for speaker.

The complaints against Pelosi do not necessarily stem from her firm grip on the caucus — she is known for being direct with lawmakers, using what she has called her “mother-of-five voice.” But her long tenure has left little room for up-and-comers, and her visibility has become a liability for some Democrats.

Republicans have poured millions into vilifying Pelosi in ads, some $13 million so far this election cycle, and the House GOP’s campaign arm says Pelosi provides “a top argument” for electing more Republicans.

As more and more Democratic candidates and lawmakers stare down campaign ads linking them to Pelosi, some are pledging to vote against her. When the cameras turn on them during the speaker vote once the new Congress convenes in January, it’s hard to see how some of them will be able to belt out the name, “Pelosi.”

Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., a vocal proponent for new leadership, envisions more of a changing of the guard than an insurrection. “I didn’t say you grab the torch out of their hands and kick them down the stairs,” she said in an interview.

The missing piece in the furious behind-the-scenes chatter over Pelosi’s future is an obvious successor. Several leaders-in-waiting having moved on, and one lawmaker who had been seen as a possible replacement, Rep. Joe Crowley, recently lost his New York primary to newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

“There can’t be a race when no one has declared their candidacy,” said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who joined Pelosi for a “Moms’ Summit” in her Houston district this month that drew 600 people. Some of them lined up for the chance to snap selfies with Pelosi. “She was not an unhappy camper; she was a happy camper.”

Democrats are loath to start the new Congress in January with a floor fight over the speakership if they are newly in power.

And many Democrats say that, with an unprecedented number of women are running for office, “it would be very unceremonial to have the first woman speaker of the House win back the house — to lead us to victory — and then not to have her be speaker,” said first-term Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.

“If we win the House, I think Nancy stays, but there’ll be a transition at some point,” the Silicon Valley congressman said.

Pelosi acknowledges she will not lead House Democrats forever and that if she retakes the gavel it will be as part of a transition to a next generation of leadership.

Two years ago she was prepared to retire if Hillary Clinton was in the White House. But once Trump won, she felt compelled to stay — “a four-year extension,” as she puts it — to protect the Affordable Care Act, banking reform and the party’s other accomplishments.

“We think the fate of the nation is at stake,” she said.",politics
"Top law enforcement officials have countered a claim by Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson that Russian operatives had penetrated some county election systems in his home state of Florida.

In a Monday letter obtained by Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and FBI Director Christopher Wray told Florida officials that while Russian spies “have previously demonstrated both the intent and capability to conduct malicious cyber operations,” there is no current evidence to suggest any meddling in the upcoming midterm elections in November.

“DHS and the FBI will continue to notify any victim of a successful cyber intrusion into their election network in any jurisdiction nationwide,” the letter, which was first reported by the Orlando Sentinel, stated.

The letter is the latest blow to Nelson's claims. It comes after Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner sent letters to the DHS, FBI and congressional leaders inquiring about the senator's assertions.

Nelson made the unsubstantiated claim earlier this month. He said Russian agents “have already penetrated certain counties in the state and they now have free rein to move about.” He added that voting machines in Florida have already been compromised by Russian meddling.

The senator’s claim drew quick retorts from a number of prominent Republicans, including Florida Gov. Rick Scott who is challenging Nelson for his Senate seat. Scott demanded that the three-term Democratic incumbent provide proof of his claim and raised the concern that Nelson may have revealed classified information.

""Until the essential question is answered – was Nelson revealing classified information or did he make this up – until that answer is clearly marked out by the senator, I think that these questions are not going away,"" Lauren Schenone, the press secretary for Scott's campaign, told The Hill.

Nelson, and fellow Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote to election officials back in July warning about potential threats to their state’s election apparatus. Nelson and Rubio suggested that 2018 would be a year that demands “greater awareness of cyber threats,” and encouraged state officials to take advantage of the “wide range of services” provided by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to safeguard against such intrusion.

Despite the criticism from Scott and other Republicans, Nelson has refused to back down from his comments.

During stops in north Florida over a two-day period last week, Nelson said state and local officials need to take Russian meddling as a ""serious threat"" and county election supervisors need to make sure they have help to protect their election systems. Russian hackers targeted at least 21 states, including Florida, during the last election.

""It would be foolish to think that the Russians are not continuing to do what they did in Florida in 2016,"" Nelson said. ""It is unfortunate that some Florida officials are trying to use this for partisan purposes.""

"Despite 10-year-low unemployment, California took advantage of loopholes in federal regulation to keep more than 800,000 federal welfare recipients from having to work.

This conclusion is based on the response of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to an application to waive SNAP's work requirements for 55 of California's 58 counties, issued to the state in July and recently obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

California's waiver, which will last until August of 2019, exempts more than 800,000 able-bodied, childless Californians from having to work while on SNAP. This in spite of the fact that California's unemployment rate—4.2 percent—is at its lowest level in at least 10 years.

About 42 million people nationwide receive federal welfare benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Some SNAP recipients—able-bodied adults without dependents, commonly called ""ABAWDs""—are required under law to work at least 20 hours a week, or spend equivalent time in education and training programs, in order to continue receiving SNAP benefits. If an ABAWD fails to meet these requirements for three months, they lose their benefits.

States can receive waivers, however, exempting ABAWDs from work requirements if the state faces certain conditions. ABAWDs can be exempted in a given county for either of two reasons: (1) if the unemployment rate in that county is higher than 10 percent or (2) if the average unemployment rate in the county over a given two-year period is 20 percent higher than the national unemployment rate in the same two-year period.",politics
"An Aeromexico jet crashed after takeoff in the northern state of Durango, Mexico, on Tuesday.

No one was killed in the accident and all 103 people aboard Flight 2431 were found, Gov. José R. Aispuro said.

The governor added that 49 people had been hospitalized, noting that some passengers got out on their own, while other wandered back to the nearby airport.

""The most seriously injured is the pilot,"" Israel Solano Mejia, director of the Durango state civil defense office, told Foro TV. ""The majority of passengers left (the plane) under their own power.""

Aeromexico initially said 97 passengers and four crew members were aboard the plane, but the governor said there were actually 103 people on the plane and that two minors had not been included in the first tally.

The incident involved Flight 2431 aboard the Embraer 190 aircraft. Mejia said the plane ""made it off the ground, but fell nose-first.""

Aispuro said Tuesday that the airliner was hit by a wind gust as it left the runway just before it crashed.

According to FlightAware, the Aeromexico flight took off on time at 3:08 p.m. local time. It was headed to Mexico City, where it was scheduled to land at 4:38 p.m.

Officials and witnesses differ on whether the plane either fell shortly after takeover or ran off the runway without really gaining altitude. But they agree the plane was trying to take off during a storm.

"The Swedish student who was branded a “hero” and captured worldwide attention after she stopped the deportation of an Afghan migrant by refusing to sit down on a plane instead prevented the extradition of a man sentenced for assault and whose asylum application was rejected.

Elin Ersson, a student at Gothenburg University, was subjected to fawning media coverage over her stunt earlier this month when she refused to take her seat on the plane until the 52-year-old Afghan deportee was released. She was successful and authorities weren’t able to deport the man.

However, Swedish Police confirmed to Fox News that the man whose deportation Ersson prevented had received a prison sentence in Sweden for assault. The police spokesman declined to go into more details about the crime the migrant has committed. His asylum application was also rejected.

A representative for Ersson declined Fox News’ request for a comment.

One of the largest newspapers in Finland, Helsingin Sanomat, reported last week as well that the man was sentenced for assault. The man will still eventually be deported, though the date remains unknown, the newspaper reported.

Despite lacking information about the man who was being deported, most media organizations jumped on the story, with the Washington Post calling Ersson’s stunt a “dramatic act of civil disobedience” while Newsweek magazine described the student as a “hero”.

CNN, meanwhile, spoke with Swedish authorities who confirmed that it was “forced deportation,” yet the outlet didn’t reveal why the man faced deportation.

The Swedish student live streamed the whole incident and it was viewed nearly 5 million times on Facebook alone. In the video, she’s heard saying “there is a man who is going to get deported to Afghanistan, where he will most likely get killed” and the she won’t “sit down until this person is off the plane.”

“I am doing what I can to save a person’s life,” she continues. “As long as a person is standing up, the pilot cannot take off. All I want to do is stop the deportation, and then I will comply with the rules here. This is all perfectly legal, and I have not committed a crime.”

An annoyed passenger tried to grab the phone from Ersson, saying she’s upsetting others. To which the student replied: “It's not my fault that he's getting deported. I'm trying to stop this.”

The Latest on developments in Afghanistan (all times local):

6:30 p.m.

An Afghan official says the last of three attackers who targeted a repatriation center in the eastern city of Jalalabad has been killed, ending an assault that left a security guard and five civilians dead.

Attahullah Khogyani, the spokesman for the provincial governor, said another 14 people were wounded in Tuesday's attack.

He says a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle full of explosives outside the compound, allowing two other attackers to get inside.

No one immediately claimed the attack, but the Taliban and the Islamic State group carry out near-daily attacks in the Nangarhar province, of which Jalalabad is the capital.

Afghan officials say casualty reports so far indicate four people were killed and eight were wounded in the militant attack underway in the eastern city of Jalalabad.

Gen. Ghulam Sanayee Stanikzai, the provincial police chief in Nangarhar, says the fighting between militants and Afghan security forces also left two policemen wounded.

Stanikzai says the militants on Tuesday targeted the government building of the refugee and repatriation department in Jalalabad, the provincial capital. Stanikzai and Gov. Hayatullah Hayat say Afghan forces killed two militants during the battle.

Attahullah Khogyani, Hayat's spokesman, says Afghan forces reacted quickly when the attack started and rescued all participants of a meeting of non-governmental organizations that was taking place in the building as well as the head of the refugee department.

He says a refugee and repatriation department is also located in the same area of the city so the immediate target wasn't clear.

Zemarai couldn't confirm any casualties but says a heavy gunbattle is taking place between Afghan security forces and the attackers.

Photographers flock to the island for pictures of the puffins, who nest there each year. However, not all visitors are respectful in the seabirds’ territory.

The highest-ranking American at the Vatican insisted Tuesday he never knew or even suspected that his former boss reportedly sexually abused boys and adult seminarians, telling The Associated Press he is livid that he was kept in the dark because he would have done something about it.

Cardinal Kevin Farrell, head of the Vatican's family and laity office, spoke as the U.S. church hierarchy has come under fire from ordinary American Catholics outraged that ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick's misconduct with men was apparently an open secret in some U.S. church circles.

An open letter Tuesday in the conservative Catholic magazine First Things urged Catholics to withhold diocesan donations to the U.S. church until an independent investigation determines which U.S. bishops knew about McCarrick's misdeeds — a ""nuclear option"" aimed at making the laity's sense of betrayal heard and felt.

Some of that outrage has been directed at Farrell, who was consecrated as a bishop by McCarrick in 2001 and served as his vicar general in the archdiocese of Washington until McCarrick's 2006 retirement. Some Catholic commentators have speculated that Farrell must have at least heard the same rumors that some Catholic laity, students and professors at Catholic University in Washington and even some journalists had heard.

Farrell lived in the same building as McCarrick and other priests and bishops, a converted school building off Dupont Circle, the top floor of which serves as a residence for Washington clergy. But Farrell said he never heard any rumors about his boss' penchant for young men, or suspected anything.

""That might be hard for somebody to believe, but if that's the only thing on your mind, well then you'll focus on that. I was focused on running the archdiocese. What Cardinal McCarrick was doing here, there and everywhere and all over the world, didn't enter into my daily routine of running the archdiocese of Washington,"" he said.

""At no time did anyone ever approach me and tell me. And I was approached by over 70 victims of abuse (in different cases) from all over the United States after 2002,"" when the U.S. sex abuse scandal first erupted, Farrell told the AP his office's reception room.

""Never once did I even suspect,"" he said. ""Now, people can say 'Well you must be a right fool that you didn't notice.' I must be a right fool, but I don't think I am. And that's why I feel angry.""

Pope Francis on Saturday accepted McCarrick's resignation as a cardinal and ordered him to live a lifetime of penance and prayer pending the outcome of a canonical trial for the sex abuse.

McCarrick, 88, was initially removed from public ministry in June after U.S. church officials determined that an accusation that he fondled a teenage altar server in New York in the 1970s was ""credible and substantiated.""

Since then, another man identified only as James has come forward saying that McCarrick first exposed himself to him when he was 11 and then engaged in a sexually abusive relationship with him for the next 20 years. McCarrick has denied the initial accusation but hasn't responded to James' accusations.

At the time of the June 20 announcement about McCarrick, the New Jersey archdioceses of Newark and Metuchen revealed that they had received three complaints from adults alleging misconduct and harassment by McCarrick and had settled two of them.

It was apparently no secret that McCarrick sometimes invited seminarians to his New Jersey beach house and into his bed, suggesting that some in the U.S. hierarchy knew of his misconduct but turned a blind eye. Certainly the New Jersey bishops who handled the settlements in 2005 and 2007 knew.

In addition, a group of concerned American Catholics reportedly travelled to the Vatican in 2000 to warn Vatican officials of McCarrick's harassment and misconduct, but he was still appointed Washington archbishop and made a cardinal in 2001.

Farrell said he never knew anything about a beach house and seminarians, and that no one ever presented any accusation to the Washington archdiocese, which from 2002 onwards was deluged with claims from victims of sexually abusive priests.

""If there were a complaint, it would have come and I would have discussed it with the (archdiocesan) chancellor, who was a woman at the time, a woman who was in charge of victims and in charge of all the telephone calls we would get,"" he said.

The current archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, has said that a review of archdiocesan records showed no complaints about McCarrick.

""There is no record there,"" Farrell told the AP. ""Because I would know about it.""",world
"North Korea last week returned 55 boxes said to contain the remains of U.S. service members who fought in the Korean War.

But only a single dog tag was included in the delivery -- with no other information to help identify each individual, a U.S. defense official said Tuesday.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it would probably take months, if not years, for U.S. forensics experts to fully determine individual identities from the remains, which have not yet been confirmed by U.S. specialists to be those of American service members.

""We don't know who's in those boxes."" - Jim Mattis, U.S. Defense Secretary

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week that the return of the remains was a welcome development in U.S.-North Korea relations, but not a guarantee that the remains were those of U.S. war dead.

""We don't know who's in those boxes,"" Mattis said.

He noted that some could turn out to be remains of missing service members from other nations that fought in the Korean War in the early 1950s.

""They could go to Australia,"" Mattis said. ""They have missing, France has missing, Americans have. There's a whole lot of us. So, this is an international effort to bring closure for those families.""

During the Korean War, combat troops of 16 other United Nations-member countries fought alongside U.S. service members on behalf of South Korea. Some of them, including Australia, Belgium, France and the Philippines, have yet to recover some of their war dead from North Korea.

The anonymous defense official also did not know details about the single dog tag, including the name on it, or whether it was even that of an American military member.

The 55 boxes were handed over at Wonsan, North Korea, last Friday and flown aboard a U.S. military transport plane to Osan Air Base in South Korea, where U.S. officials catalogued the contents.

After a repatriation ceremony at Osan on Wednesday, the remains will be flown to Hawaii where they will undergo in-depth forensic analysis, in some cases using mitochondrial DNA profiles, at a Defense Department laboratory to attempt to establish individual identifications.

Many families who are awaiting the return of their loved ones from the Korean War have already submitted DNA samples to the laboratory to aid in the process, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.

North Korea provided the 55 boxes in a delayed fulfillment of a commitment its leader, Kim Jong Un, made to President Trump at their Singapore summit on June 12.

Nearly 7,700 U.S. service members were listed as missing and unaccounted for from the 1950-53 Korean War.

The Pentagon estimates that of the approximately 7,700 U.S. MIAs from the Korean War, about 5,300 are unaccounted for on North Korean soil.

The war killed millions, including 36,000 American soldiers, according to the Star Tribune.

Richard Downes, whose father, Air Force Lt. Hal Downes, is among the Korean War missing, said this turnover of remains, having drawn worldwide attention, has the potential to put the U.S. back on track to finding and eventually identifying many more.

Downes, 70, was 3½ when his father's B-26 Invader went down on Jan. 13, 1952, northeast of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.

His family was left to wonder about his fate. Downes, now executive director of the Coalition of Families of Korean and Cold War POW/MIAs, which advocates for remains recovery, said he hopes the boxes that arrive in Hawaii on Wednesday prove to be a vanguard that leads to a fuller accounting for families.

A Turkish court rejected an appeal Tuesday to end the house arrest of an American pastor who is at the center of an escalating diplomatic row between NATO allies Turkey and the United States, Turkey's state-run news agency reported.

The court in Izmir also refused to lift a travel ban that prevents Andrew Craig Brunson, 50, from leaving Turkey, ruling there was no change in the ""strong criminal suspicion"" against the pastor, the Anadolu Agency reported.

Brunson, who has lived in Turkey for more than two decades, was arrested in December 2016 on espionage and terror-related charges. He had been jailed until he was released to home detention on July 25.

The evangelical Christian pastor denies any wrongdoing. He faces a prison sentence of up to 35 years, if he is convicted on both counts at the end of his ongoing trial.

U.S. President Donald Trump demanded Brunson's release and announced possible sanctions last week against Turkey, a crucial NATO ally, for its treatment of him. The Turkish government refused to back down and called on the United States to respect Turkey's judicial process.

""It is unacceptable for the United States to use threatening language against Turkey over a continuing judicial case,"" presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said after a Cabinet meeting.

""Turkey will never give up on its principled stance,"" Kalin added.

He reiterated that Turkey would seek international arbitration if the United States refused to deliver F-35 fighter jets in retaliation.

Brunson's lawyer, Ismail Cem Halavurt, who filed the requests the court rejected, could not immediately be contacted for comment.

Brunson, who is originally from Black Mountain, North Carolina, led the Izmir Resurrection Church in Turkey.

He was detained in the aftermath of a failed 2016 coup for allegedly supporting outlawed Kurdish rebels and the network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkey blames Gulen for the unrest, but the cleric denies involvement in the coup attempt.

Stormy, despite not ""taking it as seriously as the other runners,"" according to race organizer Grant Wholey, reportedly completed the run in two-and-a-half hours, which was the average time it took his human competitors to finish the event.

After the race, the pooch was taken to the pound, where rules indicate strays must stay for a week before being put up for adoption.

Although locked up in the shelter, Stormy was given a medal for his efforts ""since he had done the whole thing,"" Wholey said.

Wholey and Hunter ""gave [Stormy] a medal and gave him more exposure so hopefully the owner might see,"" ABC News reported.

But as for his future running ambitions, the race's finish line ""is a pet-free zone, so Stormy is going to have to spectate from the sidelines next year.""",world

Just a day after a harrowing escape from a crashed and burning Aeromexico jetliner, many of its 103 passengers and crew went to work on resuming their travel, with some even boarding new flights from the same airport in western Mexico.

Those who escaped serious injury scrambled to find clothing Wednesday, having lost their suitcases the previous afternoon when the plane plowed into a field shortly after takeoff during a violent storm. U.S. citizens who lost their passports met with consular officials who came to Durango to assist.

Some passengers spoke of one survivor who had sworn to never get on another plane and planned to buy a car and drive back to the United States.

Jose Luis Corral, a 52-year-old business owner from Portland, Oregon, still wore a neck brace from injuries he suffered in the crash.

""It's so fast, terrifying to see all the people screaming,"" recalled Corral, who was one of four people who helped the plane's badly injured pilot escape the blaze.

The pilot suffered a serious neck injury and was in the hospital. Forty-eight others were also injured, and 22 remained hospitalized Wednesday. Miraculously, no one died.

Aeromexico CEO Andres Conesa said late Wednesday that the pilot couldn't feel his feet when he was removed through a cockpit window, but after surgery had regained feeling throughout his legs.

Alberto Herrera, a 35-year-old webpage engineer from Chicago, said the violent storm shook the plane as it took off and seemed to come from nowhere.

""When we were sitting on the plane there was a little drizzle, but nothing to worry about. It was just a little light rain, super light, like barely hitting the windows,"" Herrera said.

But another passenger, Ramin Parsa, 32, of Los Angeles, said the weather was ominous even before takeoff.

""The airplane actually was shaking before we even moved so I knew it was dangerous weather,"" he said. ""I thought that we were going to have a delay until the weather clears up, but the pilot began to move, so I thought that he knows what he is doing.""

""I think it was a mistake by the pilot. He should not have taken off,"" Parsa said.

Durango state Gov. Jose Aispuro said it was too soon to speculate on the cause of the crash. Mechanical failure and human error could be factors, but certainly the weather wasn't favorable.

Herrera said the takeoff went wrong seemingly in an instant.

""You start gaining speed and as soon as you start taking off all of the sudden the plane starts struggling and it's getting hit with hail. The higher up we went into the storm, the heavier the hail got and more wind got to us,"" Herrera said.

""Then all of a sudden the plane starts rocking and it starts seriously, seriously moving around and then hitting the ground,"" he said. ""We skidded and hit a second time and you saw the flames. ...You're like 'This might be bad.'""

Herrera had braced for impact and yelled for others to do the same. The woman seated next to him was able to hold onto her toddler, though the little girl suffered some scratches and may have hit her head on a seat.

Officials said the impact ripped both engines off the Embraer 190 jetliner, and fire immediately broke out in the wings.

""My window turned red because of the flames,"" Parsa said.

He said he tried to kick out a window but couldn't. He searched for an exit and at first couldn't find one because of all the smoke. Then suddenly he felt fresh air on his face. He was in front of the exit.

""Imagine you put 100 people in a room, in a dark room, pitch dark, filled with smoke and there's a small door, everybody's trying to find it. That's what the situation was,"" Parsa said.

At the back exit, Herrera said the emergency slide deployed but the fuselage was at an odd angle, so it was unusable and people had to jump to the ground.

The passengers walked back across the muddy field to the end of runway and waited there for emergency vehicles.

Herrera credits the good outcome to both the pilot and to the fact that the plane had not gained much altitude when the storm broke.

""The pilot had to execute a maneuver correctly and then we hit the storm at its peak while we were going up, and not while we were up in the air,"" he said.

Mexico's Transport Department said the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board was sending two investigators to assist in the investigation, and the plane's manufacturer would also participate.

The department did not immediately answer questions about whether the airport was equipped with a Low Level Wind Shear Alert System that can detect weather conditions like severe downdrafts or microbursts.

Herrera got to the departure gate Wednesday evening just as a delay in his new flight was announced. Asked how he felt, he said: ""Pure anxiety.""

He had sought to limit his waiting at the airport by arriving close to departure time. He was flying to Mexico City on a plane that also carried seven other survivors, then catching a red-eye flight home to Chicago.

""I just want to get it out of the way,"" he said.

Yet the normally jovial Herrera also joked about his situation. He noted he had seen one Mexican television station calling the crash ""El Milagro de Durango — the Miracle of Durango.

""That's going to be the hashtag for the rest of my life,"" he said.",world
"The U.N. Security Council is planning to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Myanmar's violent crackdown that led about 700,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh at a meeting later this month.

British Ambassador Karen Pierce, the council president for August, said at a news conference Wednesday that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called the Rohingya crisis ""ethnic cleansing,"" is expected to brief the council at the session.

Pierce said Britain wants the Aug. 28 meeting to focus on gaining ""unconditional access"" to Myanmar for the U.N. refugee and development agencies so they can work with the Myanmar and Bangladesh governments ""to make a credible plan to get the refugees back home in safety, dignity and security.""

She said it's ""a huge issue"" that will also depend on Rohingya having ""livelihoods"" and places to live when they return. She also cited two other major issues — accountability for what happened and citizenship for Rohingya.

Rohingya face official and social discrimination in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, which denies most of them citizenship and basic rights because they are looked on as immigrants from Bangladesh even though the families of many settled in Myanmar generations ago. Dire conditions led more than 200,000 to flee the country between 2012 and 2015.

The latest crisis began with attacks by Rohingya insurgents on Myanmar security personnel last Aug. 25. The military responded with counterinsurgency sweeps and a scorched-earth campaign against Rohingya villages. It was accused of widespread human rights violations, including rape, murder, torture and the burning of Rohingya homes. Thousands are believed to have died.

The U.N. human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, has insisted that the possibility of genocide against Rohingya was real and has called for the issue to be referred to the International Criminal Court.

Pierce said the plight of the Rohingya would have to be referred by the Security Council and at the moment ""we are a hundred percent sure there would not be a positive decision."" China, a veto-wielding permanent council member close to Myanmar's government, would almost certainly oppose a referral.

But, Pierce said, ""there's a lot of collection of evidence going on in Bangladesh in the camps — evidence to a sufficiently high investigative standard against the day when there might be an accountability mechanism, and this might lead to some form of justice.""

She said this is being done by independent lawyers and the issue of whether there should be a more formal process to collect evidence is expected to be discussed in the coming weeks.

One possibility is turning to the U.N. General Assembly. The 193-member world body, where there are no vetoes, established an investigative body in December 2016 to assist in documenting and prosecuting the most serious violations of international law in Syria, including possible war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Pierce said the Aug. 25 council meeting will also review the humanitarian situation of Rohingya in Bangladesh, where they are currently struggling through monsoon rains, and encourage donors to help support them.",world

The Latest on the heatwave in Europe (all times local):

2:20 p.m.

The European Union is offering to speed up funds for farmers to help them cope with the effects of drought across the continent.

The EU's executive Commission said Thursday that farmers could obtain at least 70 percent of their rural development funds from mid-October instead of December, so they can deal with any cash flow problems.

The EU is also easing conditions that some farmers must meet to access money. In some cases, land required to be kept fallow and not used for production may be used grow animal feed.

At least eight of the 28 member countries have appealed for flexibility in the application of Europe's crop diversification and environment rules due to the adverse weather.

Hot air from Africa is bringing a new heatwave to Europe, prompting health warnings about Sahara Desert dust and exceptionally high temperatures that are forecast to peak at 47 degrees Celsius (116.6 Fahrenheit) in some southern areas.

The torrid weather meant public services were put on alert in the Iberian peninsula, where temperatures were forecast to reach 44 degrees (111 Fahrenheit) Thursday in the Portuguese city of Evora, 130 kilometers (81 miles) east of Lisbon and the Spanish province of Badajoz across the border.

A hot air mass was moving northward from Africa, authorities said, warning that the mercury could peak at 47 degrees Celsius this weekend in some areas of southern Portugal.

Portuguese authorities issued a nationwide health warning, including for dust from the Sahara Desert. Warnings were also issued for 40 of Spain's 50 provinces. The southeastern Portuguese town of Beja is expected to see a peak of 47 degrees C on Saturday.

Sweden's official tallest point is set to change amid record summer temperatures.

Scientists said a glacier on Kebnekaise mountain, the Scandinavian country's highest peak at 2,111 meters (6,925 feet, 10 inches), is melting and is no longer Sweden's tallest point.

Gunhild Rosqvist, a Stockholm University professor in geography, said the glacier lost four meters (13 feet, 2 ½ inches) of snow in July alone as Sweden endured record temperatures that triggered dozens of wildfires, even in the Arctic Circle.

In eastern Europe, Poland was also enduring unusually high temperatures as the hot African air pushed temperatures up to 34 degrees Celsius (93.2 Fahrenheit).

The country's power plants went into emergency mode to increase output due to wide use of air conditioning and electric fans. Authorities in Warsaw placed cooling water installations in the streets and advised people to stay indoors. Dozens of Baltic Sea beaches have ""no swimming"" warnings due to health risks from algae blooms.

Egypt is trying to broker a broad cease-fire deal between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers that is to pave the way for Gaza's reconstruction and an eventual prisoner swap, senior Hamas officials said Thursday.

Repeated cease-fire deals over the years collapsed, but there were signs of possible momentum toward a new agreement, after weeks of escalation along the Gaza-Israel frontier.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to put off a trip to South America to keep an eye on the situation in Gaza, a government official said Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.

Separately, a high-level Hamas delegation planned to enter Gaza later Thursday after holding talks in Cairo, said the Palestine Information Center, a Hamas-linked website.

Most of the Hamas leadership is based in Gaza but would be joined by exiled members of the group's political bureau, including Saleh Arouri, a founder of the Hamas military wing in the West Bank and a mastermind of violent attacks against Israelis in the past.

""Permitting a delegation with this level to come to Gaza is a clear sign that there are first of all guarantees that the delegation will not be targeted by the Israelis, and a sign that there are serious meetings to be held in Gaza,"" said Bassem Naim, a Gaza-based Hamas official.

He said Hamas officials would try to ""conclude the progress that has been made on files such as the truce,"" as well as a U.N.-led rebuilding of Gaza and possible reconciliation between Hamas and its domestic political rival, West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

Naim said the Hamas leaders would also talk about a possible prisoner swap with Israel.

Two other senior Hamas officials confirmed the outlines of the deal proposed by Egypt. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to provide details of closed-door negotiations.

It's not clear what role Abbas would play in Gaza, if any. He has said in the past that he would only resume responsibility for Gaza if Hamas agrees to hand over all authority there, including over security. Hamas has been unwilling to do so.

Gaza has endured a crippling border blockade by Israel and Egypt, imposed after Hamas seized the territory in 2007. In recent months, Hamas has become more desperate amid mounting financial pressure, including from Abbas. Gaza's 2 million people have had to contend with blockade-linked electricity shortages, rising unemployment and growing poverty.

Despite renewed cease-fire efforts, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced that, starting Thursday, he is halting shipments of fuel and natural gas to Gaza in response to incendiary balloons that have targeted southern Israel.

Israel also suspended fuel shipments to Gaza temporarily in July for similar reasons.

Incendiary balloons and kites, many set off during border protests organized by Hamas, have caused fires that have devastated southern Israel's farmland and forests.

Since late March, thousands of Gaza residents have participated in frequent protests along Israel's perimeter fence, in part to try to break the blockade.

In the past four months, 155 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli fire, including at least 117 in protests near the fence, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry and the Gaza rights group Al Mezan. Others, including Hamas militants, have been killed in other incidents, including Israeli airstrikes. Last month, an Israeli soldier was killed by sniper fire from Gaza.",world
"Pope Francis, in a reversal of church teaching, said in a new policy published Thursday the death penalty is always “inadmissible” because it “attacks” the dignity of all people.

Previously, the Catechism of the Catholic Church said it didn’t exclude recourse to capital punishment “if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor.” The new teaching now states there are other ways to protect common good.

“Consequently the church teaches, in the light of the Gospel, that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person,” the new policy reads.

The Vatican defended the policy, saying it wasn’t contradicting past teaching but evolving it.

“If, in fact the political and social situation of the past made the death penalty an acceptable means for the protection of the common good, today the increasing understanding that the dignity of a person is not lost even after committing the most serious crimes,” said Cardinal Luis Ladaria, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

Francis has long been an opponent of the death penalty, saying it could never be justified no matter how bad the crime is.

At a 2017 ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the publication of the catechism, Francis said the death penalty violates the Gospel and amounts to the voluntary killing of a human life, which “is always sacred in the eyes of the creator.”

"The president of one of the U.K.'s main Jewish groups called Thursday on the leader of the Labour Party to make an ""abject apology"" to British Jews for allowing anti-Semitism to fester in the left-of-center opposition party.

Allegations of anti-Jewish prejudice within Labour have grown since veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader in 2015. Some in the party allege that Corbyn, a longtime critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians, has allowed anti-Semitic abuse to go unchecked.

Corbyn apologized this week for the ""concerns and anxiety"" caused before he became Labour's leader when, as a pro-Palestinian activist, he shared platforms with people ""whose views I completely reject.""

But Board of Deputies of British Jews President Marie van der Zyl tweeted that Corbyn was ""hiding behind a half-hearted 'apology' no doubt crafted by his spin-doctors.""

""Jeremy Corbyn needs to stop hiding & make an abject apology to UK Jews in his own voice,"" she wrote.

The long-simmering dispute inside Labour recently boiled over after the party proposed adopting a definition of anti-Semitism that differed from the one approved by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.

The alliance says it is anti-Semitic to accuse Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than to their home countries, an example omitted from Labour's definition. The alliance also says it is anti-Semitic to compare contemporary Israeli policies to the policies of the Nazis, a view Labour did not endorse.

Corbyn also has received personal criticism for his past appearances alongside alleged anti-Semites and for some of his statements, including a 2010 speech in which he compared Israel's blockade of Gaza to Nazi Germany's sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad during World War II.

Labour's leadership is facing pressure to expel Peter Willsman, a party official who accused Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" of stirring up controversy around anti-Semitism.",world

Just two months ahead of Brazil's presidential election, leading candidates are struggling to find anybody willing to be their running mates.

Big names who have shunned offers to run for vice president include generals, businessmen, an astronaut, a famous actor and even a descendent of Brazil's royal family.

Even though three of the last five Brazilian leaders came to office as vice presidents, potential candidates this year have cited reasons ranging from family matters to opposition by their parties, all saying effectively, ""Thanks, but no thanks.""

The apparent disinterest in hitching one's reputation to any candidate comes at a time when the political class in Latin America's largest nation is deeply unpopular after years of corruption scandals.

The race is also up in the air because poll-leading former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is in prison and likely to be barred from running.

The candidate struggling most to find a viable running mate appears to be Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain who presents himself as an outsider despite being in Congress since 1991. Promises to crack down on corruption and crime have gained him a large following and put him second in the polls, but he has come under strong criticism for numerous racist, sexist and homophobic comments over the years.

Bolsonaro was fined for telling a female member of Congress in 2014 that she was so ugly she ""didn't deserve to be raped."" More recently, in April the attorney general charged him with racism and discrimination for comments about blacks, indigenous people, refugees, women and gays. Bolsonaro often defends himself by arguing the press takes his statements out of context.

""The cost of associating with a candidate like him, homophobic and machista, is very high,"" said Sergio Praca, a political science professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university in Rio de Janeiro. ""Being Bolsonaro's vice presidential candidate and losing (the election) would be bad for anybody.""

That apprehension was on display with one of Bolsonaro's early picks, reserve Gen. Augusto Heleno. After a public courtship by Bolsonaro, Heleno said last month that he had to decline because his party didn't approve the alliance.

Coalitions are vital in Brazilian politics because there are more than three dozen parties — more than 20 of them large enough to have some representation in Congress.

Presidential candidates often seek to cement those alliances with a vice presidential hopeful from a separate party. The size of the allied party also matters because the free campaign air time granted by law is based on current seats in Congress.

Alliances can be risky though. Current President Michel Temer took over as vice president in 2016 when President Dilma Rousseff was impeached and removed for illegal management of the federal budget. Rousseff and others from her left-leaning Workers' Party accused Temer, from a large centrist party, of being part of the plot against her. Temer denies the accusations.

Bolsonaro, who has promised to fill his government with current and former military people, has courted a second reserve general, Hamilton Mourao. Disagreements between the two men's parties initially nixed an alliance, though local reports say they are still discussing the possibility.

Bolsonaro has also reportedly courted Marcos Pontes, who was Brazil's first astronaut; Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Braganca, an heir to Brazil's last emperor; and lawyer Janaina Paschoal, who wrote impeachment legislation that eventually led to the removal of Rousseff.

A spokeswoman for Bolsonaro declined to comment on deliberations for a running mate.

Bolsonaro is not the only one struggling. Marina Silva, a former environmental minister running third in the polls, reportedly tried to recruit actor Marcos Palmeira and was rejected.

Geraldo Alckmin, former Sao Paulo governor, publicly tried to court Josue Gomes, who apart from being a successful businessman is also the son of former Vice President Jose Alencar. Gomes published an opinion piece in the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo supporting Alckmin but declining to run for personal reasons.

""In the case of Alckmin, he is struggling to show electoral viability,"" said Mauricio Santoro, a political science professor at Rio de Janeiro's state university. ""He has not been able to convince people he is a good bet.""

Potential running mates can't be blamed for being skeptical. Silva ran for president in 2010 and 2014 and came in third both times. In his 2006 bid for president, Alckmin got fewer votes in the second-round runoff with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva than he did in the crowded first round.

Alckmin's campaign declined comment on the search, and Silva's did not respond to messages.

The race has a huge wild card in da Silva, who in April began serving a 12-year sentence for a corruption conviction. While he is barred from running by law, da Silva's Workers' Party insists he will be its candidate.

However, many analysts believe party leaders may name former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad as the vice presidential pick and then make him the presidential candidate once Brazil's electoral court officially denies the candidacy of da Silva, universally called Lula by Brazilians.

""The prospects for this election are still murky,"" said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper, a university in Sao Paulo. ""The question mark is Lula, who should not be a candidate, but we don't know what will happen.""",world

For nearly three years, green buses have filed into Syria's Idlib province, bringing those evacuated from other opposition enclaves that fell to government forces — thousands of defeated rebel fighters, wanted activists and civilians who refused to go back under President Bashar Assad's rule.

They now face what is likely to be the last showdown between Assad's forces and the opposition. Assad has vowed to retake the province, and pro-government media promise the ""mother of all battles.""

If it comes to an all-out assault, it could bring a humanitarian crisis. Filled with displaced from elsewhere, the province in Syria's northwest corner is packed with some 3 million people, the most deeply irreconcilable with Assad's government and including some of the world's most radical militants. They have little option but to make a stand, with few good places to escape.

""Currently, all (opposition) from around Syria came to Idlib. The only solution is to fight. There is no alternative,"" said Firas Barakat, an Idlib resident. The 28-year old said that for years he has dedicated himself to civilian opposition activities, but now he must take up arms.

The opposition capture of Idlib in 2015 signaled the low point for Assad's government during the course of war that is now nearly 8 years old — a time when rebels controlled large parts of two main Syrian cities, major highways, border crossings, dams and oil resources.

Russian and Iranian backing enabled Assad's military to claw back territory. Most recently, it scored a victory with heavy symbolic resonance in the south, recapturing Daraa, one of the first places to rise against Assad's rule in 2011.

Around a third of the country still remains out of government hands in the north and east, most of it held by U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces that wrested it from the Islamic State group. But Idlib stands as the last significant enclave of the armed opposition that rose up dedicated to ousting Assad.

""When we saw the resistance collapse in the south— and we thought it never would give it was the first to resist the government — fear really prevailed here,"" said Barakat.

Squeezed, the opposition is desperate. But its forces are not small, and their territory is not tiny and sealed off as other opposition holdouts were. That portends a complex and difficult battle.

The number of fighters in Idlib is estimated at several tens of thousands, including thousands of battle-hardened militants from al-Qaida-linked groups and from China's Turkic-speaking Uighur minority.

Although the al-Qaida-linked group dominates, other non-jihadi factions have maintained their presence, including some of the earliest forces to take up arms against Assad. With Turkey's backing, they have formed a ""National Liberation Front,"" excluding al-Qaida.

Idlib has seen a wave of lawlessness and assassinations among the various factions, including shootings and car bombs. Saeed al-Nakrash, a rebel leader originally from near Damascus, was kidnapped and held for 50 days. He blamed al-Qaida-linked militants and said his family paid $75,000 for his release.

The opposition-held area abuts the Turkish border on the north and west. Though Turkey has built a wall, the border remains porous, providing a supply line for fighters. That wall could be overwhelmed if massive numbers try to flee Idlib.

To the east is an enclave held by Turkish-backed Syrian fighters, a possible escape route for anyone fleeing, though it is already overwhelmed by displaced.

Rumblings have started. Activists report government reinforcements arriving at Abu Dhuhur air base in eastern Idlib, which Assad's forces seized early this year. Troops have been shelling Jisr el-Shughur, a strategic opposition-held town overlooking the government stronghold on the Mediterranean coast.

Just how ferocious an offensive turns out to be depends on diplomatic maneuvering among the power players — particularly Russia. It appears reluctant for an all-out assault.

Russia is juggling between longtime ally Syria and its new friend Turkey, which has become central to the political process Moscow is leading to try to resolve the conflict.

Assad vows to restore all of Syria to its control. Turkey fears an assault will send a flood of refugees — and militants — swarming to its border.

Under a deal with Russia and Iran, Turkey has deployed around 1,000 troops at 12 observation points around Idlib to monitor a cease-fire, effectively standing between government forces and the opposition. It is part of a ""de-escalation"" zone in the province that ultimately aims to root out al-Qaida-linked groups as a basis for a future political process.

Turkey warns that a wide-scale offensive will wreck Russia's efforts.

Its deployment in Idlib is a ""trip wire that will start to tug at the (agreements with Russia) if you try to walk through it,"" said Aron Lund, a Syria expert with the Century Foundation.

From the other side, the Syrian government is testing the Russia-Turkey relationship. During the latest meeting in Russia in July, Syria's U.N. ambassador Bashar Jaafari blasted Turkey, saying it has failed to weed out extremists from Idlib.

Jaafari said Damascus encourages reconciliation with rebels, but not with al-Qaida militants — adding that it is Turkey's responsibility ""fight terrorism.""

""If Idlib returns in reconciliation, this is well and good. And if it doesn't ...the Syrian army has the right to restore control over Idlib by force.""

That makes Russia's stance critical, said Sam Heller, a researcher with the International Crisis Group.

""Ultimately what determines the survival of Idlib may be external, and they relate to these geopolitical considerations,"" he said.

Russia has already said no wide offensive is expected. That has raised speculation over a limited operation to control Jisr al-Shughur or the main highway running through Idlib.

Wael Olwan — a spokesman for one of the strongest Turkish-backed Syrian factions, Faylaq al-Sham — said Turkey working with Syrian allies can ""dissolve"" the al-Qaida-linked factions.

But, he said, ""I am not optimistic that Russia can hold back the regime forces long enough for Turkey to dismantle the radical groups.""",world

"Despite a sharp deterioration in relations over the detention of an American pastor, the United States and Turkey remain valued partners, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday, in an apparent bid to ease tensions that have rocked ties between the NATO allies.

Pompeo told reporters on the sidelines of an Asian security forum in Singapore that the two countries would continue to work with each other in the framework of the alliance and on other matters.

""Turkey is a NATO partner with whom the United States has every intention of continuing to work cooperatively,"" Pompeo said.

Earlier this week, the Trump administration took the rare, if not unprecedented, step of hitting two senior Turkish officials with sanctions over the case of Pastor Andrew Brunson, who remains in detention despite repeated demands from President Donald Trump for his release. Pompeo met on Friday with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to discuss the matter behind closed doors and said those talks had been ""constructive.""

""I made clear that it is well past time that Pastor Brunson be freed and be permitted to return to the United States,"" he said, adding that several detained local State Department employees should also be released. ""I am hopeful that in the coming days we will see that occur,"" Pompeo said.

He acknowledged ""lots of challenges"" with Turkey, but said Washington and Ankara had been able to work closely and well together. They have been at odds over numerous matters, including military activity in northern Syria and Turkey's plans to purchase an advanced air defense system from Russia.

Speaking to Turkish journalists after his meeting with Pompeo, Cavusoglu also described their discussion as ""extremely constructive"" and said the two would continue to work toward resolving disputes. But he said threats would not work. ""We repeated to them that nothing can be achieved through threatening language and sanctions and we believe that this was well understood,"" he said.

Brunson, 50, is being tried on espionage and terror-related charges, which he and the U.S. government vehemently deny. He was arrested in December 2016 following a failed coup on charges of ""committing crimes on behalf of terror groups without being a member"" and espionage. Although he was released to home detention, he faces a prison sentence of up to 35 years if he is convicted on both counts at the end of his ongoing trial. The evangelical pastor, who is originally from Black Mountain, North Carolina, has lived in Turkey for 23 years and led the Izmir Resurrection Church.

Last week, President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence threatened to impose sanctions on Turkey if Brunson was not immediately released. They said his recent transfer from prison to house arrest was not enough and on Wednesday, the Treasury Department hit Turkey's Justice Minister, Abdulhamit Gul, and Interior Minister, Suleyman Soylu, with sanctions that block any assets they may have in U.S. jurisdictions and bar Americans from doing business with them..

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has rejected the U.S. demands, saying his government won't back down and is willing to ""go its own way"" if the U.S. acted. The Turks have also vowed to retaliate for the sanctions ""without delay.""

The Turkish leader has previously connected Brunson's return to the U.S. to the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania. Ankara blames Gulen for the coup attempt, while the cleric denies involvement.",world
"A suspected Russian spy who worked at the U.S. embassy in Moscow for a decade was reportedly discovered by counter-intelligence officers and quietly dismissed last year.

The Russian national, a woman, was hired by the U.S. Secret Service and came under suspicion in 2016 during a routine security sweep carried out by the State Department, according to sources quoted by the Guardian.

The woman was dismissed last summer after an investigation found she was regularly having unauthorized meetings with the FSB, the Russian intelligence agency.

ACCUSED RUSSIAN SPY MARIA BUTINA'S LAWYER: RUSSIA 'DOESN'T WANT HER BACK, THEY WANT HER OUT'

“We figure that all of them are talking to the FSB, but she was giving them way more information than she should have,” a senior administration official told CNN.

“We knew it was happening and it was just a process of playing it out and giving her specific information that we saw her give back to the FSB.

She reportedly had access to the Secret Service’s intranet and email systems, which included schedules of the current and past presidents, vice-president and their spouses, including Hillary Clinton.

She did not have access to highly classified information, according to the official.

Her dismissal came shortly before the Kremlin demanded the expulsion of more than 750 U.S. personnel from its diplomatic mission, which is believed to have provided cover for her removal, according to the Guardian.

“The Secret Service is trying to hide the breach by firing [her],” a source told the British newspaper. “The damage was already done but the senior management of the Secret Service did not conduct any internal investigation to assess the damage and to see if [she] recruited any other employees to provide her with more information.”

TRUMP OFFICIALS SOUND ALARM ON RUSSIAN MEDDLING, VOW TO FIGHT BACK: DEMOCRACY 'IN THE CROSSHAIRS'

A State Department spokesman would ""not comment on allegations related to intelligence or personnel matters.""

The Secret Service meanwhile said: it recognized ""all Foreign Service Nationals (FSN) who provide services in furtherance of our mission, administrative or otherwise, can be subjected to foreign intelligence influence. This is of particular emphasis in Russia.""

The statement added: “As such, all Foreign Service Nationals are managed accordingly to ensure that Secret Service and United States Government interests are protected at all times. As a result, the duties are limited to translation, interpretation, cultural guidance, liaison and administrative support...At no time, in any U.S. Secret Service office, have FSNs been provided or placed in a position to obtain national security information.”

The revelations come as Maria Butina, a 29-year-old Russian woman, was charged last month with covertly working as a foreign agent while living in the United States.

Butina has pleaded not guilty and has been held in jail without bond.

The Trump administration meanwhile warned on Thursday that Russia is attempting to influence U.S. elections.

“We continue to see a pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to try to weaken and divide by the United States,” Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said.",world

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Russia, China and other countries on Saturday against any violation of international sanctions on North Korea that could reduce pressure on the North to abandon its nuclear weapons.

Speaking on the sidelines of an Asian security forum in Singapore, Pompeo told reporters that the U.S. has new, credible reports that Russia is violating U.N. sanctions by allowing joint ventures with North Korean companies and issuing new permits for North Korean guest workers. He said Washington would take ""very seriously"" any violations, and called for them to be roundly condemned and reversed.

""If these reports prove accurate, and we have every reason to believe that they are, that would be in violation,"" Pompeo said, noting that the U.N. Security Council had voted unanimously in favor of the sanctions. ""I want to remind every nation that has supported these resolutions that this is a serious issue and something we will discuss with Moscow.""

""We expect the Russians and all countries to abide to the U.N. Security Council resolutions and enforce sanctions on North Korea,"" he said. ""Any violation that detracts from the world's goal of finally, fully denuclearizing North Korea would be something that America would take very seriously.""

Late Friday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley raised similar concerns, saying that ""talk is cheap."" ''Russia cannot support sanctions with their words in the Security Council only to violate them with their actions,"" she said in a statement. She made her comments as the U.S. asked the Security Council to add a North Korean bank executive, a North Korean company, a Chinese company and a Russian bank to the U.N. sanctions blacklist.

In his discussions with Southeast Asian officials in Singapore, Pompeo said he had implored them all to ""strictly enforce all sanctions,"" including an end to ship-to-ship transfers of oil for North Korea, and had been encouraged by the response.

Despite the warning to Russia, Pompeo said he remained optimistic that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will follow through on his pledge to President Donald Trump to denuclearize. But he said the timeline for the North's full and final denuclearization remains a work in progress.

Earlier, in an interview with a Singapore's Channel News Asia, Pompeo had said the pace for the dismantlement of the North's nuclear weapons program would rest with Kim. ""The ultimate timeline for denuclearization will be set by Chairman Kim, at least in part,"" he said. ""The decision is his.""

At the news conference, however, Pompeo appeared to step back from that comment, noting that the timeline is subject to negotiation between Washington and Pyongyang. He recalled that Kim had committed to denuclearization at the historic summit with Trump on June 12 in Singapore and that both sides ""have been working since then to develop the process through which that will be achieved.""

""The process of achieving denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is one that I think we have all known will take some time,"" Pompeo said, adding later: ""I am optimistic that we will get this done in a timeline and the world will celebrate what the U.N. Security Council has demanded.""

Pompeo said on Friday that while there's ""still a ways to go,"" the United States remains ""confident"" in North Korea's commitment to denuclearize.

On Thursday, the White House announced that Trump had received a new letter from Kim and had responded quickly with a letter of his own. The correspondence came amid fresh concerns over Pyongyang's commitment to denuclearization despite a rosy picture of progress painted by Trump.

"Gaza's Hamas rulers led several thousand Palestinians in a protest along the frontier with Israel on Friday, in an apparent show of presence as Egyptian efforts intensify to broker a broad truce between the Islamic militant group and Israel.

A 25-year-old Palestinian was killed and 90 were wounded by Israeli army fire, Gaza health officials said. It was the latest in a series of protests along Gaza's perimeter fence with Israel, aimed in part at trying to break an 11-year-old border blockade. Israel and Egypt sealed Gaza in 2007, after Hamas overran the territory.

Friday's protest was attended by several exiled Hamas leaders who had entered Gaza a day earlier for meetings of the group's decision-making political bureau. ""We want to break the siege on Gaza once and forever,"" said Hussam Badran, one of the visiting Hamas leaders.

The political bureau is discussing Egyptian proposals for a truce with Israel and the U.N.-led reconstruction of Gaza, said Ghazi Hamad, a Gaza-based official in the group. Meetings began Thursday and will continue through Saturday, Hamad said. It marked the first time all members of the political bureau got together in Gaza, Hamas has said.

Over the years, truce deals have proven fragile, and it was not clear if the current efforts would succeed. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday called off a planned trip to South America and scheduled a meeting of his security Cabinet for Sunday to monitor Gaza developments.

Tensions along the Israel-Gaza fence have escalated since Hamas launched regular protests in the area in late March. Large turnout has also been driven by widespread desperation in Gaza, amid worsening conditions linked to the blockade. Power is on for just a few hours a day, unemployment has sky-rocketed and poverty is widening.

Friday's death brought to 156 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire since late March, including at least 118 in protests near the fence. Others, among them armed Hamas militants, have been killed in attempted border attacks or in Israeli airstrikes. Several thousand Gazans have been wounded by Israeli fire since March.

The Israeli military said that about 8,000 Palestinians took part in Friday's rally. It said a tank fired at a Hamas military post in Gaza after Palestinians briefly crossed the frontier and threw bombs. The military said its soldiers sustained no casualties in the incident.

In another development, a boat carrying activists challenging Israel's naval blockade of Gaza is approaching the territory, said the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an umbrella group for pro-Palestinian and Islamic charities from around the world.

The coalition said Friday that the Swedish-flagged vessel, Freedom, was nearly 60 miles (95 kilometers) off the coast. The boat and another vessel, which was intercepted by Israeli forces on Sunday, set sail to Gaza from Europe last week.

The Israeli military had no immediate comment.

Activists have made several attempts to breach the blockade in recent years, most notably in 2010, when Israeli naval commandos killed nine Turks in a raid at sea.

"An Australian woman who injured two people during a convenience store ax attack has been convicted of attempted murder after jurors reportedly rejected her argument that she was suffering from a mental episode caused by medications she was taking to transition from male to female.

Evie Amati, 26, was found guilty Friday for the unprovoked 2017 attack in Sydney and will face sentencing in September, according to the BBC.

""I really hope that [Amati] is able to have some sort of rehabilitation because ultimately that's what justice is about,” Sharon Hacker, a victim who suffered a fractured skull in the attack, told reporters following the verdict.

On January 7 last year, Amati was captured on surveillance video walking into a 7-Eleven store carrying an ax around 2 a.m. local time.

She walked up to a man waiting in line at the cash register, later identified as Ben Rimmer, and talked to him briefly before swinging the ax at him, the BBC reported. Rimmer fell to the ground with a facial wound and fractures, while Hacker was then attacked near the door.

Amati also targeted a third man outside the store, but he managed to protect himself by using his backpack as a makeshift shield.

The BCC reported that Amati was arrested outside the store. During her trial, the victims said they thought she had come from a costume party when she walked into the store with the weapon.

Amati pleaded not guilty and told jurors that she was in a bad mental state because she was taking hormones to help her transition from male to female, the station added.

Her lawyer, Charles Waterstreet, was quoted saying Amati was “out of her mind” and was also affected by drug and alcohol use.

But the jury ultimately sided against Amati, convicting her of two counts of wounding with intent to murder and another count of attempted wounding with intent to murder.",world

Maduro, according to AP's account of events, was giving a speech in the capital of Caracas during a celebration of the National Guard's 81st anniversary. He was wearing the presidential banner.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro dodged an apparent assassination attempt when drones armed with explosives detonated while he was delivering a speech to hundreds of soldiers being broadcast live on television, officials said.

Caught by surprise mid-speech, Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, looked up at the sky and winced Saturday after hearing the sound of an explosion pierce the air.

""This was an attempt to kill me,"" he said later in an impassioned retelling of the events. ""Today they attempted to assassinate me.""

Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said the incident took place shortly after 5:30 p.m. as Maduro was celebrating the National Guard's 81st anniversary. The visibly shaken head of state said he saw a ""flying device"" that exploded before his eyes. He thought it might be a pyrotechnics display in honor of the event.

Within seconds, Maduro said he heard a second explosion and pandemonium ensued. Bodyguards escorted Maduro out of the event and television footage showed uniformed soldiers standing in formation quickly scattering from the scene.

He said the ""far right"" working in coordination with detractors in Bogota and Miami, including Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, were responsible. Some of the ""material authors"" of the apparent attack have been detained.

""The investigation will get to the bottom of this,"" he said. ""No matter who falls.""

Venezuela's government routinely accuses opposition activists of plotting to attack and overthrow Maduro, a deeply unpopular leader who was recently elected to a new term in office in a vote decried by dozens of nations. Maduro has steadily moved to concentrate power as the nation reels from a crippling economic crisis.

In the midst of near-daily protests last year, a rogue police officer flew a stolen helicopter over the capital and launched grenades at several government buildings. Oscar Perez was later killed in a deadly gun battle after over six months on the lam.

Attorney General Tarek William Saab said the attempted assassination targeted not only Maduro, but rather the military's entire high command on stage with the president.

Prosecutors have already launched their investigation and obtained critical details from the suspects in custody, said Saab, adding that he would give more details Monday.

""We are in the midst of a wave of civil war in Venezuela,"" Saab said.

Firefighters at the scene of the blast disputed the government's version of events. Three local authorities said there had been a gas tank explosion inside an apartment near Maduro's speech where smoke could be seen streaming out of a window. They provided no further details on how they had reached that conclusion.

A Colombian official with the president's office described Maduro's claims that Santos was involved in the attack as baseless.

Adding to the confusion, a little known group calling itself Soldiers in T-shirts claimed responsibility, saying it planned to fly two drones loaded with explosives at the president, but government soldiers shot them down before reaching its target. The Associated Press could not independently verify the authenticity of the message.

""We showed that they are vulnerable,"" the group said in a tweet. ""It was not successful today, but it is just a matter of time.""

The organization did not respond to a message from The Associated Press.

David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America who has spent decades researching Venezuela, said the incident did not appear to be a staged attack by Maduro's government for political gain.

The ""amateurish"" attack prompted embarrassing images of Maduro cut off mid-sentence with droves of soldiers running away in fear, making the president appear vulnerable, Smilde noted. Despite the optics, Smilde said he suspected that Maduro would nonetheless find a way to take advantage of it.

""He will use it to concentrate power,"" Smilde said. ""Whoever did this, he'll use it to further restrict liberty and purge the government and armed forces.""

The event had been just one more of many Maduro routinely holds with members of the military, a key faction of Venezuelan society whose loyalty he has clung to as the nation struggles with crippling hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine.

""We are going to bet for the good of our country,"" Maduro declared triumphantly moments before the explosion. ""The hour of the economy recovery has come.""

Images being shared on social media showed officers surrounding Maduro with what appeared to be a black bullet-proof barrier as they escorted him from the site. Maduro said at no point did he panic, confident the military would protect him.

""That drone came after me,"" he said. ""But there was a shield of love that always protects us. I'm sure I'll live for many more years.""

The Workers' Party in Brazil named jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Saturday as its nominee for the country's top job.

Delegates of the left-leaning party confirmed da Silva, who served two terms as Brazil's president between 2003 and 2010, with enthusiastic approval at a convention in Sao Paulo.

Since March, the former president has been jailed on a corruption conviction, but he denies any wrongdoing and claims he is being politically persecuted.

Members of Brazil's top electoral court have suggested he will be barred from running in October's elections. But da Silva leads polls for the office by a large margin, and surveys show voters would lend their support to another Workers' Party candidate if he cannot participate.

The party is not expected to name his running mate until Monday.

In a recorded message to the convention, da Silva said that ""it is those that sentenced me that are jailed in a lie.""

""Brazil needs to restore its democracy, find itself and be happy again,"" he said. ""They might lock me up, shut me up, but I will keep my faith in the Brazilian people.""

After his nomination was approved, another message written by da Silva was read aloud.

""They already brought down a president that was elected and now they want to veto the right of the people to elect their next president. They want to invent a democracy without people,"" he said.

Meanwhile, other candidates criticized da Silva and his party.

""It pains my heart, but I don't expect anything from them now,"" said left-leaning presidential hopeful Ciro Gomes, of the Democratic Labor Party.

Conservative Geraldo Alckmin, who was named by the Social Democracy Party as its presidential nominee Saturday, cast blame for the country's 13 million unemployed.

""It was the lies and the radicalism that created the chain of events that is the tragic heritage of the Workers' Party,"" he said.

Workers' Party chairwoman Gleisi Hoffmann, who is trying to lure other left-leaning parties to the ticket, addressed supporters at the convention after two fringe parties endorsed da Silva's run.

""They tried to exclude Lula from the political discussion,"" she said. ""There is no political discussion in Brazil without Lula and the Workers' Party.""

Italy has made headlines as a hard place for migrants recently, with racist attacks against blacks on its soil and a new government closing Italian ports to people rescued in the Mediterranean Sea.

But not all Italians are on board, and some are even reaching out to migrants.

Barbara di Clemente, a 79-year-old grandmother, opened her heart and home to Moriba Mamadou Diarra from Mali, hosting him at her two-bedroom apartment in Rome for the past four months. The 18-year-old says he fled his country because there, his ""rights had been denied"" and he couldn't study and build a better future for himself.

She says that taking in Diarra, who dreams of playing professional soccer, has been her own way of helping someone in need while making a political statement against Italy's populist, anti-migrant government. Di Clemente is among a growing number of Italians who have applied to host young migrants, stepping in to fill a gap in government services even as the number of new arrivals to Italy plummets.

""Something in my soul spoke to me,"" Di Clemente said of her decision to host Diarra, adding that having lived through World War II, she is particularly sensitive to wars and poverty.

She contacted Refugees Welcome, a humanitarian group founded in Germany in 2015 that helps organize migrant hosting and now has chapters in 16 countries. The Italian chapter, which normally registers one or two hosting offers per day by Italians, saw an 80 percent spike in offers since the June 10 decision by Interior Minister Matteo Salvini to turn away a rescue vessel carrying more than 600 migrants rescued from the Mediterranean.

Sara Consolato, the group's spokeswoman, says volunteers want to show the migrants that not all Italians agree with the government's hard line. ""They are a minority, but they exist,"" she said. ""They don't identify with these policies and they feel the time has come to take action.""

Some gestures don't rise to letting a complete stranger move in but are no less significant, and have come amid a spate of racist attacks against blacks and non-Italians. A coffee shop owner in Adria in northern Veneto — a region that has long supported Salvini's anti-migrant League party — started printing out cash register receipts last month stamped with ""No to racism, yes to an integrated Adria."" Another local businessman took out newspaper ads with the same message.

Although the League's popularity has soared since it took power with the populist 5-Star Movement after March 4 elections, some 72 percent of Italians support the principle of asylum and 61 percent feel concerned about the rise of racism and discrimination, according to a survey by pollster Ipsos MORI and commissioned by More in Common, a nonprofit organization that works against xenophobia.

However, the survey also found that only 18 percent of respondents view the impact of immigration on the country positively. The survey consisted of online and phone surveys of 2,000 people between 2017 and 2018. The margin of error was between 0.4 and 2.1 percent.

Di Clemente, a retired therapist, said that while watching the news she had thought several times about welcoming a refugee in her home. After a check-up by Refugees Welcome, Diarra was assigned to her apartment in Rome.

""We introduced ourselves, and I told him: 'My heart is racing, and yours?' And he said: 'Mine, too,'"" Di Clemente recalled of their first meeting.

She set two basic rules right away: No smoking, no drugs.

""The truth is that I don't smoke, so I felt good about moving in with her,"" Diarra said.

He said he loves their frequent trips to a nearby sports center, where he trains and plays soccer.

""Soccer is what gives me the strength to get up in the morning, to go study, to work,"" he said, wearing the jersey of the Italian national soccer team. ""It pushes me to become a better person.""

Diarra was among some 15,000 unaccompanied minors who arrived in Italy by boat in 2017. For a few months, he lived in a residence for migrant children in Rome, where he attended school and studied Italian.

When he turned 18, he was transferred to a reception center for asylum-seekers, a 90-minute drive from Rome, where he said he received very little support in his attempt to learn Italian and integrate into society. He was relieved to return to Rome.

Living together presented some challenges. At first, Di Clemente was bothered by Diarra's reluctance to look into her eyes when they spoke. Diarra explained that in his culture young people don't face older people out of respect, but the woman insisted that he adapt to Italian culture. She said she also taught him to do the Italian double-cheek kiss.

Diarra, a practicing Muslim, observed the fasting month of Ramadan earlier this year, despite Di Clemente's concerns that he should not attend soccer practice while fasting. He decided to compromise by breaking the fast on training days and adding a number of fast days after the holiday.

In the kitchen, Di Clemente appreciates their cultural differences. ""The things he cooks are better than what I cook,"" she said with a laugh.

Diarra now works at a summer camp by day and plays soccer in the evening, as he waits for his asylum application to be processed.

According to data released by Vatican charity organization Caritas, the Interior Ministry rejected more than half of the 41,379 requests in the first half of 2017. It granted refugee status to only 9 percent of the applicants, while the remainder obtained a residency permit for ""humanitarian"" or other motives.

Most applicants reside in reception centers across the country. After receiving the papers, they can apply to enter centers of ""secondary reception,"" but fewer spots are available there, and some end up living in tent camps.

Despite criticism from many humanitarian groups, Interior Minister Salvini — whose motto is a Trump-like ""Italians First"" — has recently announced that the government will limit benefits to the migrants who have already received protection status. He's also vowed to reduce aid for asylum seekers. Salvini often uses the phrase ""The party is over"" when he refers to migrants.

Paolo Morozzo della Rocca, the Rome-based supervisor of migrant services of the Sant'Egidio Catholic charity, said it's counterproductive to keep migrants in a limbo without helping them to build a future for themselves.

Diarra, who stressed his belief in the importance of learning Italian and integrating into Italian society, said he doesn't pay attention to what Salvini says.

""I don't like him,"" Diarra said. ""He speaks in the name of the Italian people, but I don't think the Italian people are like that.""",world
"During a visit to New Zealand, Polish President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday defended the moves his nation's government have made to take control of the judicial system.

Poland's conservative government lowered the retirement age for Supreme Court judges from 70 to 65 as part of a broader judicial overhaul which has put it in conflict with the European Union. Poland's Supreme Court this month suspended implementation of the legislation, which would force more than one-third of the court's justices to retire.

Duda told reporters in Auckland that 80 percent of Polish society believes that deep reform of the judicial system is absolutely necessary.

Speaking through an interpreter, Duda said a group of prominent judges were losing influence because they were retiring.

""They're not happy with that, because they are people in high positions who have been members of the Polish judicial system for a very long time,"" he said. ""They were also very deeply involved in the judicial system back in the 1970s when Poland was oppressed by the communists, and these people were also very often members of the Communist Party.""

The EU is increasing pressure on Poland over what it sees as flaws in the law, and last week gave Warsaw a month to act before facing possible court action.

The EU Commission said the law falls short of the values guiding the 28-nation bloc, and said that Poland's explanation ""does not alleviate the Commission's legal concerns."" It said a case could be opened at the EU's highest court in a month.

Duda said the Polish government was fulfilling one of its basic promises.

""I think what we are going through now can be compared to the flu,"" Duda said. ""I hope we are able to recover from this flu and not contract another one.""

Duda also defended Poland's immigration policies, after the nation opted out of Europe's migration settlement schemes.

The tactic of swapping leaders in the hope of boosting governments' standing in opinion polls as elections loom has left parties bitterly divided. Foreign governments are left wondering whether Australian leaders will be around long enough to fulfill bilateral agreements.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is the latest to face the prospect of not leading his conservative Liberal Party to the next election, due by May.

There are things to know about how these political processes work.

HOW AUSTRALIAN PARTIES DUMP THEIR LEADERS

Australians often talk about voting for a political leader to become prime minister in the same way that Americans discuss electing a president. But it has become increasingly evident that the leaders of the major parties have been chosen by party lawmakers and have been replaced at the same lawmakers' discretion.

A petition signed by a majority of the Liberal Party's 85 lawmakers — at least 43 — is enough to trigger a party meeting to hold a leadership ballot. It's a secret ballot but the final numbers are made public.

Turnbull headed off that process and gained the advantage of surprise by declaring his own job open to nominations on Tuesday. Few had been forewarned. Senior minister Peter Dutton was the only candidate nominated. Many were surprised that he only lost by 48 votes to 35 since he hadn't started canvassing support in earnest. One of the 85 lawmakers entitled to vote was away on sick leave and another abstained.

Dutton will now negotiate with his colleagues on what it will take to win their support, including policy changes and Cabinet promotions.

Turnbull ousted his predecessor, Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a Dutton ally, in the same way almost three years ago.

___

THE OPPOSITION HAS LEARNED FROM ITS MISTAKES

The instability began when the center-left Labor Party in elections in 2007 ended Liberal Prime Minister John Howard's run of more than 11 years in office. It was the second-longest term an Australian prime minister has served.

Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was suddenly replaced during his first term by his deputy, Julia Gillard, who was replaced three years later by Rudd.

Many in Labor concluded that Rudd shouldn't have been dumped in the first place and the party changed its rules to make ousting a prime minister more difficult.

Labor lawmakers now only have a 50 percent say in the choice of leader. Previously the decision was theirs alone, like the Liberal Party. Labor Party grassroots members who are not elected now have an equal say in who becomes leader. The balloting of party members who are not lawmakers takes a month, meaning Australians will never again wake to news that a Labor prime minister had been changed without warning.

___

PERIODS OF INSTABILITY HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE

There have been two periods of leadership instability in recent decades and both have involved a prime minister's unexpected death.

From 1966 to 1972 there were six prime ministers, including Harold Holt who vanished while body surfing in 1967.

From 1939 to 1945, there were eight, including Frank Forde who was replaced by his Labor colleagues after only eight days in office.",world

The people of the flood-battered Indian state of Kerala are ""in a great struggle to rebuild their lives,"" the state's top official said Wednesday, as aid workers warned it could take days before the full scope of the destruction is clear.

Though rains have stopped over the past three days and floodwaters are receding, vast swaths of the tropical state, known for its idyllic villages and beautiful beaches, remain underwater or coated with mud, and many people have no drinking water or electricity.

""We know the humanitarian needs are enormous, but it will be some time before we know just how big that is,"" Ray Kancharla, a manager with the aid group Save The Children, said in a Tuesday statement. ""Roofs and walls have collapsed; roads have been completely washed away.""

He estimated it could take ""well over a week"" before the effects of the devastation are clear.

Torrential downpours began hammering Kerala on Aug. 8, more than two months into the annual monsoon season, setting off devastating floods that left more than 200 people dead and sent more than 800,000 fleeing for dry land.

""The people of Kerala are in a great struggle to rebuild their lives after the flood,"" said the state's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, sending his greetings for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. ""May this Eid be an inspiration for all of them,"" he said on Twitter.

On the island of Kunjunnikkara, about 20 kilometers (10 miles) from Kochi, hundreds of Muslims undeterred by the flooding gathered Wednesday at a local mosque for Eid prayers. They also prayed at a nearby cemetery for those who had lost their lives in the floods.",world
"An anesthesiologist used a yoga ball filled with carbon monoxide to kill his wife and daughter in 2015, prosecutors told a Hong Kong court Wednesday.

An autopsy determined the doctor’s wife and daughter died from carbon monoxide poisoning. While investigating, police discovered a deflated yoga ball in the car near where the two bodies were found. The South China Morning Post reported a jogger found the bodies in the parked car.

Khaw, who was an associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, allegedly killed his wife because he was having an affair with a student and his wife wouldn’t divorce him, prosecutors told Hong Kong’s High Court, according to Sky News. However, prosecutors said they didn’t think Khaw wanted to kill his daughter.

Recent revelations of sexual misconduct and cover-up within the highest ranks of the U.S. Catholic Church have revived the sense of betrayal that devastated the American church's credibility after the first wave of scandal hit in 2002.

But the United States is by no means alone: Cases of Catholic priests raping and molesting children, and of bishops covering up for them, have erupted on nearly every continent in recent years, with Pope Francis' native Latin America the latest to explode.

Francis is expected to address the issue head-on this weekend when he visits Ireland, the first country to come to grips with the problem in the 1990s.

A glance of where the global Catholic scandal has played out most visibly in recent years:

UNITED STATES

After the abuse scandal erupted in Boston in 2002, U.S. bishops adopted the toughest anti-abuse norms in the Catholic Church, a ""one strike and you're out"" policy that removes any priest from ministry if he commits a single act of abuse that is admitted to or established.

The norms require dioceses to report allegations to police and have a lay-led review board to receive and assess claims.

The U.S. scandal was revived in June with revelations that one of the cardinals who drafted the 2002 policy, the retired archbishop of Washington Theodore McCarrick, himself had been accused of molesting at least two minors as well as adult seminarians. He has said he is innocent, but recently resigned as a cardinal.

The scandal has exploded anew with the Pennsylvania grand jury report finding some 300 priests sexually abused at least 1,000 children in six dioceses since the 1940s.

___

CHILE

Francis discovered first-hand just how pervasive clerical sex abuse is — and how effectively it has been covered up by the Catholic hierarchy — when he created the greatest scandal of his five-year papacy earlier this year.

During a January visit to the once staunchly Catholic Chile, Francis set off a firestorm of criticism when he branded as ""calumny"" accusations of cover-up against a Chilean bishop he had strongly defended.

After realizing his error, Francis did an about-face: He ordered a Vatican investigation, apologized in person to the victims he had discredited, and strong-armed the entire Chilean hierarchy to tender their resignations.

It wasn't enough. Chilean criminal prosecutors are now on the case, and have staged a series of raids on the church's secret archives to seize documents and plan to depose the current archbishop of Santiago.

___

AUSTRALIA

Australia launched a four-year national investigation into all forms of institutional abuse — Catholic and otherwise — that found 4,444 people were abused at more than 1,000 Catholic institutions between 1980 and 2015.

The Royal Commission investigation, Australia's highest form of inquiry, deduced that seven percent of Catholic priests in Australia between 1950 and 2010 had been accused of sexually abusing children.

One of them is Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican finance minister and Francis adviser who last year took a leave of absence to stand trial in Melbourne on historic sex abuse charges. Pell has said he is innocent.

More recently, Francis accepted the resignation of Adelaide Archbishop Philip Wilson after he became the most senior Catholic cleric convicted in criminal court of covering up abuse. He was sentenced to serve a one-year sentence at home. Wilson has denied wrongdoing and plans to appeal.

___

FRANCE

One of France's most prominent cardinals, Philippe Barbarin, is due to stand trial in January on charges he covered up for a known pedophile in Lyon, where Barbarin has been archbishop since 2002.

Barbarin and five other French defendants are accused of knowing that the Rev. Bernard Preynat sexually abused young scouts but didn't report him to police. Preynat, now in his 70s, has confessed in letters to victims' parents and meetings with his superiors, including Barbarin.

Another defendant is the Vatican official in charge of abuse cases, named because Barbarin consulted him about Preynat and was told to keep the priest away from children but to do everything to avoid scandal.

Just this week, a French priest, the Rev. Pierre Vignon, launched a petition urging Barbarin to resign as archbishop and cardinal. By Wednesday it had gathered more than 5,000 signatures.

Barbarin, 67, has admitted to making some ""mistakes"" in the management and nominations of priests, but has denied any attempt to cover up the Preynat case.

___

IRELAND

Judge-led investigations have produced four mammoth reports since 2005 into the church's wretched record in dealing with predator priests, helping to dismantle the Catholic Church's once- dominant influence in Irish society and politics.

The reports have detailed how tens of thousands of children suffered wide-ranging abuses in church-run workhouse-style institutions, how Irish bishops shuttled known pedophiles throughout Ireland and to unwitting parishes in the U.S. and Australia, and how Dublin bishops didn't tell police of any crimes until forced by the weight of lawsuits in the mid-1990s.

One of the final investigations, into the diocese of Cloyne, found that officials there were still shielding suspected pedophiles from the law until 2008 — more than 12 years after the Irish church unveiled a policy requiring the mandatory reporting of all suspected crimes to police.

That policy, however, was rejected by the Vatican in 1997 as undermining canon law — a position that, combined with the Vatican's refusal to cooperate in the Irish fact-finding probes, prompted the Cloyne inquiry to find the Vatican itself culpable in promoting the culture of cover-up.

In response, Ireland's then-Prime Minister Enda Kenny issued a blistering attack on the Vatican, accusing it of downplaying the rape of children to protect its own power and reputation.

Kenny's 2011 parliament speech, in which he denounced ""the dysfunction, disconnection, elitism....the narcissism that dominate the culture of the Vatican to this day,"" led to a diplomatic standoff.

___

VATICAN CITY

While only a few hundred people live in the world's tiniest sovereign state, Vatican City's criminal jurisdiction covers the Holy See's global diplomatic corps, and two priestly diplomats have faced trial in recent years.

In June, the Vatican tribunal convicted Monsignor Carlo Capella of possession and distribution of child pornography and sentenced him to five years in prison. Capella admitted to viewing the images during a period of ""fragility"" and interior crisis sparked by his job transfer to the Vatican embassy in Washington.

In 2013, the Vatican charged its then-ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Monsignor Jozef Wesolowski, with sexually abusing young boys. Wesolowski was defrocked by the Vatican's church court, but he died before the Vatican's criminal trial got underway.",world

A man with severe psychiatric problems killed his mother and sister and seriously injured another woman in a knife attack Thursday in a Paris-region town, officials said.

Police shot and killed the man soon afterward. The Islamic State group, which has a history of opportunistic claims, swiftly claimed responsibility.

French prosecutors weren't treating the attack in Trappes, west of Paris, as a terrorism case, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said. He noted the attacker suffered from serious mental health issues although he had also been flagged for glorifying terrorism.

Collomb said that the man killed his mother at her home and stabbed the other women outside. Still wielding the knife, he then ignored police warnings and was shot and killed, the minister said after meeting officers and prosecutors in Trappes.

He described the man as ""unstable, rather than someone who was engaged, someone who could respond, for example, to orders and instructions from a terrorist organization, in particular from Daesh."" Daesh is another name for IS.

A long-time friend of the attacker named him as Kamel Salhi, 36. The friend, Said Segreg, said Salhi had no obvious problems, didn't abuse drugs or alcohol and wasn't fervently religious.

A government official confirmed Salhi's name and age. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss such details publicly.

Salhi was divorced and living with his mother, said Adama Traore, another of his acquaintances in Trappes.

The Islamic State group, via its Aamaq news agency, claimed responsibility. The agency said the attack was motivated by calls from the IS leadership to attack civilians in countries at war with the extremist group. Hours earlier, IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi urged followers to attack enemies everywhere.

The Islamic State group, which has lost most of the territories it once controlled in Iraq and Syria, has been known to make opportunistic claims in the past, even when there was no established link between an attacker and the extremist group.

Indonesia's largest Muslim organization has criticized the blasphemy conviction and imprisonment of a Buddhist woman who complained that the call to prayer from her neighborhood mosque was too loud.

Officials from Nahdlatul Ulama, which claims 60 million members, said Thursday the woman's complaint about mosque loudspeakers doesn't constitute blasphemy under Indonesian law.

The ethnic Chinese woman, Meiliana, was sentenced to 18 months in prison on Tuesday by a court in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra province, providing new fuel to concerns that an intolerant brand of Islam is gaining ground in Indonesia.

The country's constitution guarantees freedom of speech and religion, but religious minorities are frequently the target of blasphemy prosecutions. The overwhelming majority of cases end with guilty verdicts.

Word of the woman's original comments in July 2016 sparked a riot in Tanjung Bali, a port town on Sumatra. Mobs burned and ransacked at least 14 Buddhist temples in the town.

""We believe that Meiliana did not commit blasphemy,"" Robikin Emhas, a deputy chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, told The Associated Press.

He said a complaint about a speaker's volume for the five-times-a-day call to prayer does not contain any element of hatred against a religion.

""I regret this matter has been brought to the court, it actually should be settled in a peaceful way,"" Emhas said.

Prosecutors had accused the 44-year-old defendant of violating the criminal code by committing blasphemy against Islam, the dominant faith in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation. About 85 percent of Indonesians are Muslim, but Protestants, Catholics, Hindus and Buddhists are each numerically significant minorities.

Another prominent Nahdlatul Ulama official, Rumadi Ahmad, who was an expert witness at Meiliana's trial, said in a Facebook post that his testimony was ignored.

""Meiliana, forgive me,"" he wrote. ""You have become a sacrifice, just ahead of the Islamic holiday Eid-al-Adha.""

He said under Islamic law the call to prayer itself is not part of highest religious teachings that must be followed so does not fall under the blasphemy law. The woman's complaint in conversation with a few people also could not be considered a blasphemous public advocacy against a religion, Ahmad said.

Since 2004, 147 people have been imprisoned under blasphemy or related laws, according to monitoring by Human Rights Watch. The number of cases has slowed since 2014 under President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo's administration.

Muhammadiyah, the second-largest Muslim organization, said the legal process should be respected but also called for tolerance.

""People should understand that the call to prayer, or ""azan,"" must be heard by the congregation. But how loud the sound is needs to be a dialogue between communities,"" chairman Haedar Nashir said in a statement.",world

A political battle is brewing in flood-ravaged south India, with the ruling party in Kerala state protesting the central government's refusal to accept $100 million in relief offered by foreign governments.

""It is only natural for nations to help each other,"" said Kerala's top elected official, Pinyari Vijayan, as residents waded into the immense cleanup effort after floods killed more than 200 people and drove more than 800,000 into relief shelters.

The state finance minister said the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi must either accept a $100 million aid offer from the United Arab Emirates, or compensate Kerala by that amount.

Trying to shed its longtime image as a poverty-wracked nation, India has refused to accept aid from foreign governments since a 2004 tsunami, when New Delhi told potential government donors that India would contact them if it needed financial aid.

India is ""is committed to meeting the requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts,"" foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said in a statement Wednesday night.

""The government of India deeply appreciates offers from several countries, including from foreign governments, to assist in relief and rehabilitation efforts after the tragic floods in Kerala,"" he continued.

India has said individuals and foundations are welcome to send donations.

The torrential rains which began Aug. 8 in Kerala slowed early this week and floodwaters have been receding. But vast swaths of the tropical state, known for its idyllic villages and beautiful beaches, remain coated with mud, and many people have no clean drinking water or electricity.

The Kerala state government, run by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), expressed disappointment after Modi offered the state 6 billion rupees, roughly $85 million, or about one-fourth of the 22 billion rupees it requested.

Isaac said the state government had made no requests for foreign assistance, but the UAE offered 7 billion rupees, about $100 million.

""It is below our dignity to accept foreign aid,"" he said in a tweet, mimicking and ridiculing the central government.

Qatar has offered India $5 million aid, and Indian media reports say the Maldives and Thailand have also said they could provide financial support.

The UAE has a large population of expatriate Indian workers, many of them from Kerala.

While individuals and foundations in the UAE have pledged millions of dollars in aid, its central government has not acknowledged making any direct donation offers. Emirati officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday during the Eid al-Adha holiday.

Many of the 150 migrants stranded aboard a coast guard ship for a ninth day began a hunger strike Friday out of frustration that Italy won't let them disembark in Sicily unless fellow European Union nations first pledge to take them, authorities said, in the latest standoff provoked by Italy's anti-migrant interior minister.

""They can do whatever they believe,"" Interior Minister Matteo Salvini tweeted, shrugging off the development that migrants were refusing meals aboard the Italian coast guard vessel Diciotti. The ship rescued them on Aug. 16 from a foundering human trafficker's boat in the central Mediterranean, and for days now has been docked in the port of Catania, Sicily.

An opposition lawmaker, Sen. Davide Faraone said that on Friday Catania port officials told him ""there's tension"" on the ship and that migrants have stopped eating.

Thirteen young children and ailing adults were evacuated from the Diciotti early in the drama. On Wednesday, 27 minors, all teenagers, were allowed to disembark in Catania. Salvini has been adamant that Italy's populist government won't allow any of the 150 adults still aboard the vessel disembark unless other EU nations commit to taking the asylum-seekers.

All but about 18 of those aboard are Eritrean; the others are from Somalia, Syria and Sudan. They have told authorities they suffered months and even years of inhumane treatment in detention in Libya, while waiting to leave that lawless country aboard smugglers' boats.

Another opposition lawmaker who went aboard on Thursday expressed particular concern about 11 women, some as young as 19 or 20, still there.

Appealing to Salvini, Laura Boldrini said: ""As a father, they could be your daughter. At least let the young women off"" the Diciotti.

Sky TG24 TV said some women aboard ate lunch Friday but the men refused the meal.

But Salvini was staying tough, as was fellow deputy premier, Luigi Di Maio, who heads the senior coalition partner, the euro-skeptic 5-Star Movement.

Di Maio threatened that Italy could withhold some of its yearly 20 billion euro ($23 billion) contribution to the bloc if EU nations didn't make good on promises earlier this year for more solidarity toward the Italians, who have seen more than 600,000 rescued migrants brought to Italian shores in recent years.

If the European Commission meeting doesn't ""decide anything about the Diciotti ship and the re-distribution of the migrants, I and all the 5-Star Movement are no longer willing to give 20 billion to the European Union,"" Di Maio said.

In Brussels, EU Commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein retorted that ""the European Union is a community of rules and it operates on the basis of rules, not threats."" He urged ""all parties involved to work constructively together to find a swift solution.""

A meeting in Brussels Friday of lower-officials from 12 countries, including Italy, was grappling with how to share the migrant burden among EU members. The meeting wasn't called to deal with the Diciotti standoff, but was expected to discuss it.

Spain's center-left government approved Friday legal amendments ensuring that the remains of former dictator Gen. Francisco Franco will be dug up and removed from a controversial national mausoleum honoring its civil war dead.

The minority Socialist government is certain that parliament will endorse the amendments, probably in a debate next month, deputy prime minister Carmen Calvo told a news conference.

The amendments to Spain's Historical Memory Law of 2007 grant the government power to exhume Franco's body. That change aims to thwart legal efforts by Franco's descendants and supporters to block the exhumation in the courts.

Removing Franco's remains from the Valley of the Fallen, a mausoleum he ordered built 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Madrid, would be a momentous event in Spain which still bears social and political scars from the 1936-39 civil war.

The vast Valley of the Fallen complex is most conspicuous public legacy of Franco's rule. It was built by Franco as a tribute to those killed in the 1936-39 civil war when he deposed Spain's democratic government in what he called his ""glorious crusade.""

Some 34,000 people from both sides of the fighting are buried at the site, most of them never identified.

""Having Franco's tomb (at the complex) shows a lack of respect ... for the victims buried there,"" Calvo said. She noted that a visiting United Nations delegation said four years ago that ""democracy is incompatible with a tomb which honors the memory of Franco.""

The Memory Law, which outlawed public events supporting the Franco regime, fell short of addressing the broad demands of civil war survivors and victims' relatives for exhumations and reparations.

Franco's descendants will be consulted and will have 15 days to say where they would like the remains to be placed after exhumation. If they do not reply, the government will choose a ""dignified place,"" Calvo said after the government's weekly Cabinet meeting.

Francisco Martinez-Bordiu, a grandson of Franco, described the exhumation plans as ""barbaric,"" telling Antena 3 in an interview Friday that descendants would assess their legal options for halting it.

An exhumation of Franco's embalmed body — possibly as early as October — would cement the government's reformist and liberal credentials after taking power last June.

Removing Franco from the mausoleum, which is owned and operated by the cultural heritage agency, a public-funded body, has long been discussed in Spain.

Calvo said the government is fast-tracking the exhumation because it wants to ""end a state of affairs which cannot go on any longer.""

At next Friday's Cabinet meeting, the detailed administrative procedures for the exhumation will be set out, she said.

The Valley of the Fallen complex includes a mausoleum and basilica in a neoclassic style and is a popular pilgrimage site for people who are nostalgic for the dictatorship. It has a 150-meter (500-foot)-tall cross that can be seen from many kilometers (miles) away.

Franco, who died in 1975, is in a tomb in the basilica's central nave beneath a 1.5-metric ton tombstone.",world

In what would have been unthinkable in India before the Asian Games, there'll be no kabaddi gold medals for the spiritual home of the sport.

A day after Iran stunned the seven-time champion Indian men in the semifinals, the Iranians won the women's title with a 27-24 thriller over India on Friday.

Too bad for India, which has long dominated a sport that blends tag and tackle with wrestling moves.

The Indian women took an early 7-3 lead but Iran rallied to take a 17-13 margin and eventually held on in a tense finish for victory.

The Iranian men were playing for gold against South Korea later Friday. The Koreans in the group stage became the first team ever to beat India's men's team at the Asian Games. This is the first time since the sport was introduced in 1990 that India won't win a gold.

India's woes continued when former No. 1-ranked Kidambi Srikanth was upset 23-21, 21-19 in the second round of men's singles in the badminton by Vincent Wong of Hong Kong.

The sixth day of competition was expected to be headlined by Japanese teenager Rikako Ikee and her bid for a sixth gold medal, and a record-equaling eighth medal at a single Asian Games.

Ikee led qualifiers in the heats of the women's 50-meter freestyle.

China's three-time Olympic champion Sun Yang was aiming for his fourth freestyle gold medal of the games, hoping to add the 1,500 title to his victories in the 200, 400 and 800.

Until Friday, no cyclist had won both the road race and the individual time trial at the same Asian Games. Now two cyclists have done it.

Two days after her road race victory, South Korea's Na Ah-reum won the women's time trial at Subang in West Java from Eri Yonamine of Japan and Leung Wing Yee of Hong Kong.

Kazakstan's Alexey Lutsenko made it back-to-back golds on back-to-back days by winning the men's time trial from Muradjan Khalmuratov of Uzbekistan and Japan's Fumiyuki Beppu, whom he edged in a sprint finish to the road race 24 hours earlier.

Japan won its fifth consecutive Asian Games softball gold medal with a 7-0 shutout against Taiwan.

The first Asian Games gold medal ever awarded the Asian Games, and Cambodia's first medal for the 2018 games, went to Jessa Khan, who beat Mahra Alhinaai of the United Arab Emirates in the women's 49-kilogram class.

Kim Hyo Sim won North Korea's fifth gold medal in weightlifting with victory in the women's 63-kilogram division.

Kim collected gold with a total of 250 kilograms, well clear of fellow North Korean Choe Hyo Sim, who was a silver medalist at the 2016 Olympics and the 2015 world championships.

With China barred from the weightlifting competition for doping violations, the North Koreans are atop the standings in the sport.

The first doping case of the Jakarta-Palembang games was registered against a wrestler from Turkmenistan. The Olympic Council of Asia said Rustem Nazarov, who lost in the quarterfinals of the 57-kilogram division, was disqualified from the games after testing positive for the banned diuretic furosemide in a test on the eve of the opening ceremony.

There were six doping cases at the last Asian Games held at Incheon, South Korea, in 2014.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out Friday at the European Union over its first financial support package to help bolster Iran's flagging economy, calling it ""a big mistake"" and ""like a poison pill to the Iranian people.""

Speaking on a trip to Lithuania, Netanyahu criticized the EU, which announced Thursday a first tranche of 18 million euros ($21 million), part of the bloc's commitment to keeping the Iran nuclear deal alive.

In May, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from that deal, and began restoring U.S. sanctions. The move has been exacerbating a financial crisis in Iran that has sent its currency tumbling.

""I think that the decision yesterday by the EU to give 18 million euros to Iran is a big mistake. It's like a poison pill to the Iranian people and to the efforts to curb Iranian aggression in the region and beyond the region,"" Netanyahu said.

""Iran attempted to conduct a terror attack on European soil just weeks ago... That is incredible,"" he told a press conference that followed a meeting with three Baltic prime ministers — Lithuanian Saulius Skvernelis, Estonia's Juri Ratas and Maris Kucinskis of Latvia.

Netanyahu was apparently referring to a suspected bomb plot against an Iranian opposition rally in France in late June that was thwarted by authorities. An Iranian diplomat is suspected of involvement.

Earlier, Netanyahu met with Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite who reiterated the EU position that Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory violate international law.

A day earlier, Netanyahu said that Israel was ""often mistreated by the EU,"" adding there were ""many distortions."" Netanyahu, however, welcomed the decision by major international airlines to end their direct flights to Iran's capital, Tehran, in September, after Trump's sanctions move.

Skvernelis said in an interview with the Baltic News Service that after a meeting Thursday with Netanyahu, ""I believe Lithuania really has a better understanding of Israel and that understanding could be spread among other EU countries. ""

""We need to better listen, hear them out and understand their position. We definitely lack a direct dialogue,"" he said.

""But we have to admit that today Israel is not only waging war and defending its independence, the lives of its people, but is also fighting in a wider context, if we speak about terrorism and potential expansion of IS fighters to Europe,"" Skvernelis said.

Netanyahu arrived Thursday in Vilnius on a four-day visit, the first to Lithuania by an Israeli prime minister.

"President Trump lashed out at Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a string of tweets on Monday, accusing him of hurting Republican chances in the upcoming midterm elections with a series of Justice Department investigations.

Continue Reading Below

“Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department,” Trump tweeted. “Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff.....”

The president apparently was referring to the current investigations into GOP Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York. Fox News has reached out to the White House for additional clarification, and the Justice Department did not immediately respond.

Hunter and his wife, Margaret, were indicted last month on charges of illegally converting $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses and filing false records, while Collins was indicted earlier in August on insider-trading charges. Prosecutors pinpointed the alleged insider trading to June 2017, after Trump took office.

COLLINS, ACCUSED OF INSIDER TRADING, SAYS HE'LL STAY ON BALLOT FOR RE-ELECTION

Trump also tweeted: “The Democrats, none of whom voted for Jeff Sessions, must love him now. Same thing with Lyin’ James Comey. The Dems all hated him, wanted him out, thought he was disgusting - UNTIL I FIRED HIM! Immediately he became a wonderful man, a saint like figure in fact. Really sick!”

Monday’s tweets continued a long-running gripe Trump has had with Sessions ever since the attorney general recused himself last year from the Russia investigation. Last month, the president tweeted that Sessions ""doesn't understand what is happening underneath his command position"" and told ""Fox & Friends"" that his attorney general had ""never taken control of his department.""

The president also said the only reason he named Sessions to one of his most important Cabinet-level positions was the former Alabama senator's early support in the 2016 presidential election.

The comments prompted a pointed response from Sessions, who said in a statement that ""While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.""

In an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday, Trump said Sessions would remain in his job at least until the November midterm elections. The president did not elaborate on whether he would keep Sessions on as attorney general following the election.

"CNN political analyst April Ryan twisted Sarah Sanders' words on Thursday night in order to make the absurd suggestion that the White House press secretary is looking for a physical confrontation with the star reporter.

After Ryan asked a combative question during Thursday’s press briefing, accusing her of being ""blindsided"" by comments Rudy Giuliani recently made on Fox News, Sanders told Ryan, “Well, with all due respect, you actually don’t know much about me in terms of what I feel and what I don't.”

Ryan misquoted Sanders while speaking to CNN colleague Don Lemon on-air afterwards, claiming the press secretary said, “You don’t know me,” before declaring the phrase to be fighting words.

“For Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the presidential spokesperson, the mouthpiece for the President of the United States, to say, ‘You don’t know me,’ in certain quarters in this nation, that starts a physical fight,” Ryan said. “I was very shocked. It was street. I will even go beyond that, it was gutter.”

Sanders did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Sanders, who is from Hope, Ark., soon found herself catching Twitter shade from none other than former Democratic Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake – as first reported by Daily Caller’s Amber Athey – who offered Baltimore native Ryan an “unsolicited comeback suggestion.”

Rawlings-Blake recommended that next time, Ryan should say, “I may not know you, but I damn sure know a LIE! And you are wearing it Sis, all over your face -oh wait is that a smudge in your liner.”

The “liner” remark is a callback to the controversial standup routine during the White House Correspondents’ Dinner when Michelle Wolf poked fun at the press secretary’s eye liner.

Ryan quickly responded, “Lol stop. Bmore in the house I know you have my back. That you don’t know me stuff begins fist fights. She needs to know what she is saying. I am not the one.”

Rawlings-Blake then responded, “Already took my earrings off and Vaseline in my purse,” and added a fist emoji, to which the CNN political analyst fired back, “That is what I am talking about! Take off that pretty ring to fornthe [sic] street fight. Lol.”

Ryan and Sanders have been involved in verbal altercations in the past. Sanders recently slammed Ryan, who is American Urban Radio’s White House correspondent, for asking if President Trump has thought about stepping down.

Sanders fired back, “No, and I think that’s an absolutely ridiculous question.”

Ryan also famously accused Sanders of lying about whether or not she baked a pie for Thanksgiving.

The United States Secret Service directed Fox News to CNN and the White House when asked if they consider the latest comments a threat. CNN did not respond to request for comment.

"Embattled Justice Department official Bruce Ohr had contact in 2016 with then-colleague Andrew Weissmann, who is now a top Robert Mueller deputy, as well as other senior FBI officials about the controversial anti-Trump dossier and the individuals behind it, two sources close to the matter told Fox News.

The sources said Ohr's outreach about the dossier – as well as its author, ex-British spy Christopher Steele; the opposition research firm behind it, Glenn Simpson’s Fusion GPS; and his wife Nellie Ohr's work for Fusion – occurred before and after the FBI fired Steele as a source over his media contacts. Ohr's network of contacts on the dossier included: former FBI agent Peter Strzok; former FBI lawyer Lisa Page; former deputy director Andrew McCabe; Weissmann and at least one other DOJ official; and a current FBI agent who worked with Strzok on the Russia case.

Weissmann was kept ""in the loop"" on the dossier, a source said, while he was chief of the criminal fraud division. He is now assigned to Special Counsel Mueller’s team.

The list includes several figures who have since attracted the scorn of President Trump as he decries the Russia probe and those involved in its early stages. Trump has been particularly tough on Ohr, given his wife Nellie’s past work for Fusion GPS, as the president alleges bias against him inside the department. Just Thursday morning, Trump complained on Twitter about Nellie Ohr's Fusion work and exclaimed, ""Bruce was a boss at the Department of Justice and is, unbelievably, still there!""

Ohr's broad circle of contacts indicates members of FBI leadership knew about his backchannel activities regarding the dossier and Steele.

Congressional Republicans are still trying to get to the bottom of Ohr's role in circulating the unverified dossier, which became a critical piece of evidence in obtaining a surveillance warrant for then-Trump campaign aide Carter Page in October 2016. Ohr was grilled by House committees behind closed doors for seven hours earlier this week.

A Republican-authored House Intelligence Committee memo released in February said that Steele ""maintained contact"" with Ohr ""before and after"" the government fired the ex-British spy as a source. ""Shortly after the election, the FBI began interviewing Ohr, documenting his communications with Steele,"" the memo said. ""For example, in September 2016, Steele admitted to Ohr his feelings against then-candidate Trump when Steele said he 'was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.'""

In addition, Ohr's handwritten notes, reviewed by Fox News, showed that two weeks after the election, on Nov. 21, he made a list including Page, Strzok and the FBI agent – which may have been a reference to a meeting. ""No [prosecution] yet. Push case ahead on M. May go back to Chris,"" he wrote. Congressional investigators told Fox News they believe the ""M"" likely refers to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who recently was convicted on tax and bank fraud charges in Virginia, and the ""Chris"" is Christopher Steele.

That same month, Steele was fired by the FBI as a confidential source over his contact with the media about the dossier.

According to court records, an FBI memo also states that Weissmann met as early as April 2017 with a group of reporters about Manafort. The timing appears significant, coming one month before FBI Director James Comey was fired and Mueller was appointed to lead the special counsel team.

Republican lawmakers who questioned Ohr earlier this week say the connections between Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie, who did Russia research for the opposition research firm behind the dossier, were known.

""When they went to court, the FBI knew three important things. And they did not disclose this to the court,"" Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said. ""They knew the Ohrs’ involvement in the production of the dossier. They knew that Chris Steele had this extreme bias against the president. And they knew who paid for the dossier. And they did not disclose these key facts to the court when they went there to get the warrant to spy on Carter Page and the Trump campaign.""

Fusion GPS and its co-founder have not responded to Fox News' questions for this story, or previous reports. While Fusion GPS financial records were the subject of a lawsuit, and are not public, sources told Fox News that Nellie Ohr received ""multiple payments"" in 2016 from Fusion GPS, and the amounts were ""not small change.""

Fox News contacted lawyers for the current and former officials with whom Ohr was in contact, as well as Mueller's office, and they declined to comment or did not respond.

House Democrats say the focus on Ohr, a career civil servant whose portfolio did not include Russia, is being mischaracterized by Republicans, and his outreach on behalf of Steele was not prohibited or unlawful. As part of a ""fact check"" provided to reporters, Reps. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said, ""In fall 2016, the FBI ended their formal relationship with Mr. Steele as a confidential human source due to his unauthorized disclosures to the press — not because of any factual issues with the 'dossier' or other information Mr. Steele had provided.""

The senior Democrats continued: ""When Mr. Steele subsequently reached out to Mr. Ohr with additional information, Mr. Ohr appropriately handed it off to FBI investigators to assess its credibility and potentially corroborate with other evidence. At the time, Mr. Ohr was the Director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force and it was not his job to vet the accuracy of this information himself.""",politics
"Omarosa Manigault Newman’s claims about a recording of President Trump using the “N-word” are being disputed by an ever-growing list of current and former officials, calling into question a key passage in her newly released political tell-all.

Manigault Newman’s claims first surfaced this week in a media blitz to promote the book, “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House,” which hit the shelves Tuesday. In interviews and the book, she claimed she confirmed rumors of an old tape from “The Apprentice” in which Trump used the racial slur.

It is unclear at this point whether Manigault Newman ever heard the alleged tape—and whether it exists.

But multiple former and current officials close to the president have denied her claims.

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Fox News he “never heard of any tape.”

“I have never heard the president use that word ever,” Lewandowski said Tuesday, adding that there was “never a conversation” about a tape and that it was “never brought to [his] attention.”

“This is now a pattern of individuals who have worked inside the building who are trying to profiteer off of their relationship with the president,” Lewandowski said. “It’s too bad, it’s shameful and our country, and the president, deserve better.”

Michael Short, a former White House aide, also told Fox News he had no knowledge of the tape.

“I never heard the president use any of the epithets alleged in the book or epithets of any kind,” Short told Fox News.

Manigault Newman suggested the reason Chief of Staff John Kelly fired her from her White House post was her pursuit of the tape. She wrote in her book that former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks told Kelly that Manigault Newman was “this close” to getting her “hands” on the tape.

“Given the circumstances and the timing, I had to believe that the purpose was to prevent me from getting the N-word tape, which, by logic, I was now convinced had to be real,” she wrote in the prologue.

But the former “Apprentice” star has given varying accounts about the tape. In the book, she claimed she never heard the tape, but during interviews this week, she claimed she heard the recording after the book was written.

Lynne Patton, a former assistant to Eric Trump and now a Department of Housing and Urban Development official, pushed back on Manigault Newman's claims.

In a statement, Patton said she got a call from her on the day she was fired, “informing me that she had personally heard a second-hand recording of President Trump using the ‘N-word’ in a derogatory fashion.” In that call, she said, Manigault Newman claimed she voluntarily “submitted her resignation” to Kelly and recommended that Patton “should promptly do the same before the audio surfaced.”

Manigault Newman claimed this week that the original source of the alleged tape was former “Apprentice” producer Bill Pruitt.

But Patton said she spoke to Pruitt, and he has “NEVER had an audio tape” of Trump using the slur.

Pruitt did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

Katrina Pierson, former campaign spokeswoman, also told ""Fox News @ Night"" that she has ""no sources with that tape.""

Pierson also denied ever having a conversation about the tape, adding that “the reason Omarosa is facing a wrath of contradiction is because she can’t keep her lies straight.” Patton, too, denied being on a conference call with Manigault Newman discussing the tape rumors -- as she claimed in her book.

However, the emergence of yet another recording on Tuesday challenged that part of their claims. Manigault Newman released to CBS News a supposed recording of that phone call. It purportedly features her, Patton, Pierson and campaign communications director Jason Miller.

""I am trying to find at least what context it was used in to help us maybe try to figure out a way to spin it,"" Pierson says on the tape.

Patton is then heard describing a conversation she had with Trump about his alleged use of the slur.

""I said, 'Well, sir, can you think of anytime where this happened?' And he said, 'no,'"" Patton is heard saying.

Manigault Newman responds: ""Well, that is not true.""

Pierson later says: ""No, he said it. He is embarrassed by it.""

Upon the release of the CBS tape, Pierson attempted to clarify her comments.

“I never organized a conference call with Jason Miller to confirm Mr. Trump said anything. That discussion was nothing other than sifting through unconfirmed rumors regarding ‘The Apprentice’ tape and the transcript supports my statement,” Pierson said in a statement to Fox News Tuesday. “Omarosa fabricated the story by conflating numerous discussions.”

Also in the book, Manigault Newman claimed that pollster Frank Luntz had directly heard the “N-word” tape.

Luntz fired back on Friday, tweeting that her claim was “flat-out false.”

“I’m in @Omarosa’s book on page 149. She claims to have heard from someone who heard from me that I heard Trump use the N-word. Not only is this flat-out false (I’ve never heard such a thing), but Omarosa didn’t even make an effort to call or email me to verify. Very shoddy work,” Luntz tweeted.

Trump on Monday night also tweeted that executive producer of “The Apprentice” Mark Burnett assured him there are “NO TAPES” where he used “such a terrible and disgusting word.”

“@MarkBurnettTV called to say that there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa. I don’t have that word in my vocabulary, and never have. She made it up,” Trump tweeted.

"The idea was once relegated to the far-left. But the liberal push to abolish the federal agency that enforces federal immigration laws is going mainstream in the Democratic Party, with New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Mayor Bill de Blasio adding their support to the cause in the last 24 hours.

""I believe that [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] has become a deportation force … and that's why I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works,"" Gillibrand said in a CNN interview Thursday night.

“We should abolish ICE,” de Blasio said Friday morning on WNYC radio.

Gillibrand's endorsement is notable as she's the first sitting senator to back the 'abolish ICE' push -- and is considered a potential 2020 presidential contender.

They join numerous other Democratic candidates, House members, liberal commentators and writers who have fought back against the Trump administration's immigration policies by calling to gut ICE -- which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.

The growing influence behind the push was underscored earlier this week with liberal primary challenger Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's shocking victory over Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., a member of party leadership.

Ocasio-Cortez emphasized her support for abolishing ICE during the campaign, and even protested outside an ICE center in Texas.

DEMS DEMAND ELIMINATION OF ICE AMID IMMIGRATION FUROR

“Its extra-judicial nature is baked into the structure of the agency and that is why they are able to get away with black sites at our border, with the separation of children,” the Democrat said in an interview this week.

The focus on ICE comes in the wake of the controversy over the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, which called for all illegal border crossers to be prosecuted. This in turn led to the separation of families due to longstanding detention rules, until President Trump signed an executive order last week ordering families be detained together.

With that controversy in the headlines, the abolition of ICE -- which has long been the purview of far-left sections of the Democratic Party base advocating for open borders and no deportations -- has moved from being a slogan on protest placards to an idea being mulled by rumored 2020 hopefuls.

""Every country needs reasonable law enforcement on their borders. ICE is not reasonable law enforcement. ICE is broken, it’s divisive and it should be abolished,"" de Blasio tweeted Friday.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also has come under heavy pressure from the left to call for the elimination of ICE, particularly amid a far-left challenge from actress and activist Cynthia Nixon -- who called it a terrorist organization.

And Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who has been floated as a 2020 Democratic contender, said that the U.S. should consider “starting from scratch” for ICE -- though stopped short of calling to abolish it.

In Oregon, Rep. Earl Blumenauer, who voted against the agency’s creation in 2002, doubled down on his opposition in a recent Medium post in which he called for it to be shut down.

“We should abolish ICE and start over, focusing on our priorities to protect our families and our borders in a humane and thoughtful fashion,” he said.

In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general.

“ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,” Fallon tweeted. “Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.”

The idea isn’t limited to deep-blue Democratic enclaves.

Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., announced Monday that he will introduce a bill to abolish the agency, set up during President George W. Bush’s administration in the wake of 9/11.

“I’m introducing legislation that would abolish ICE and crack down on the agency’s blanket directive to target and round up individuals and families,” Pocan said in a statement. “The heartless actions of this abused agency do not represent the values of our nation and the U.S. must develop a more humane immigration system, one that treats every person with dignity and respect.”

The shift to the left on immigration has some Republicans and conservatives delighted, thinking that it may move Democrats into unelectable territory.

""Based on the last week, Democrats apparently want to campaign on open borders, mass migration, & abolishing ICE,"" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said on Twitter. ""Give them points for honesty. Let's vote.""

An ICE spokesperson, Liz Johnson, assistant director of the Office of Public Affairs, called the clamor to abolish ICE ""dangerously misguided,"" saying it overlooks ""the vital work that ICE officers and special agents perform each day to keep the citizens of New York safe.

“Over the last year, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in New York arrested more than 5,000 criminal aliens – removing public safety threats from the streets. During the same period, ICE Homeland Security Investigations’ cases have led to more than 280 arrests of MS-13 gang members and associates, seizures of hundreds of weapons, and hundreds of criminal arrests for narcotics violations to include heroin and fentanyl-related offenses.



“Instead of being insulted with politically motivated attacks, the men and women of ICE should be praised for risking life and limb every day in the name of national security and public safety.”

"Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday vowed to be “a neutral and impartial arbiter” if confirmed to the Supreme Court, after a chaotic first day of hearings on Capitol Hill amid political theatrics and protests from Democrats.

“If confirmed to the Supreme Court, I will keep an open mind in every case,” Kavanaugh said. “I will do equal right to the poor and to the rich. I will always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law.”

Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings started Tuesday and are set to continue through the week.

Before he spoke, Kavanaugh was introduced by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman and attorney Lisa Blatt – a liberal Democrat who said she voted for Hillary Clinton for president but supports Kavanaugh’s nomination.

Democrats, in their opening remarks Tuesday, sounded the alarm about Kavanaugh’s past work in Republican politics, including as a lawyer in George W. Bush’s White House.

But Kavanaugh said Tuesday, “I don’t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences.”

Earlier Tuesday, protests from Democratic lawmakers and demonstrators delayed the formal start of proceedings by more than an hour. Within moments of Tuesday's confirmation hearing kickoff, top Democrats tried to sideline the session with a rapid-fire string of objections concerning access to the nominee's records.

The spectacle underscored the political nature of the confirmation hearings, coming two months before the midterms and as some senators gear up for a possible 2020 presidential run against President Trump. Several of those senators led the charge Tuesday in objecting to Kavanaugh.

When Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley first tried to deliver opening remarks, Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris raised objections to the committee just receiving a batch of 42,000 documents relating to the nominee's work with past administrations.

“We cannot possibly move forward,"" Harris, a potential 2020 Democratic presidential contender, said.

Grassley told her she was ""out of order,"" but other Democrats chimed in to back up Harris, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who moved to adjourn.

This prompted applause from some in the audience, and touched off protests and shouting. Then, after New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker added his voice complaining of a ""rush,"" Grassley countered: “I think you are taking advantage of my decency and my integrity.”

The chaos led Republican Sen. John Cornyn to remark, ""This is the first confirmation hearing subject to mob rule."" The Texas senator suggested Democrats would be “held in contempt of court” if they behaved that way in a court of law.

More than an hour and 15 minutes after the hearing began, Grassley moved past Democratic attempts to delay and finally delivered his opening statement, over the sustained shouts of protesters who were being escorted out of the room.

""Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified nominees – if not the most qualified nominee – I have seen,"" Grassley said.

The disruptions continued as lawmakers attempted to make opening statements. There were 63 interruptions before the break for lunch.

Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch struggled to deliver his prepared remarks, as protesters audibly shouted over him.

“I think we ought to have this loudmouth removed,"" a frustrated Hatch said. ""We shouldn't have to put up with this kind of stuff.""

Grassley acknowledged it was one of the most unruly openings of any Supreme Court hearing, saying ""this is something I've never gone through before in 15 Supreme Court nominations.""

The Capitol Police said they arrested 70 people on Tuesday.

Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin defended the outbursts.

“What we've heard is the noise of democracy,” Durbin said. “This is what happens in a free country when people can stand up and speak and not be jailed, imprisoned, tortured or killed because of it.”

Kavanaugh has left one of the longest paper trails of any recent Supreme Court nominee, having served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office in the George W. Bush administration.

Kavanaugh also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.

Booker, another possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, acknowledged he already decided to vote against Kavanaugh’s confirmation. But he pleaded to delay the vote until more documents are released.

“We should not vote now,” Booker said. “We should wait. And if we're not waiting, we should object to your nomination.”

Democrats have seen thousands of those documents, but say they want time to review and seek more.

“If you will trust the American people, they will trust you,"" Durbin told Kavanaugh. ""But if your effort today continues to conceal and hide documents, it raises a suspicion.”

Democrats have specifically raised objections over how the Senate received 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents the night before the confirmation hearing began.

“This is the most incomplete, most partisan, least transparent vetting for any Supreme Court nominee I have ever seen,” Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy said.

KAVANAUGH HEARINGS LAUNCH AMID PARTISAN FIREWORKS

Grassley, in a written statement submitted for the record, on Tuesday accused Democrats of trying to “bury this committee in millions of pages of irrelevant paperwork.” He called out California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s ranking member, for wanting to search the emails of every Bush White House aide for Kavanaugh documents.

“This would have taken months and months to complete,” Grassley said. “As I have repeatedly stated, I am not going to put the American taxpayers on the hook for the Democratic leaders’ fishing expedition.”

As the hearing kicked off, Democrats zeroed in on the controversy over the production of documents from Kavanaugh’s past work. But as the hearing went on, the Democrats began emphasizing their concern over how Kavanaugh would rule on cases involving abortion and guns.

“You are being nominated for a pivotal seat,"" Feinstein said. ""It would likely be the deciding vote on fundamental issues.”

Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse told Kavanaugh the NRA “has poured millions into your confirmation,” saying they “clearly have big expectations on how you will vote on guns.” He also expressed fear that Kavanaugh would rule to overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling regarding abortion.

“Despite confirmation etiquette, your own words make clear you don't really believe Roe vs. Wade is settled law, since the court, as you said, can always overrule its precedent,” Whitehouse said.

Republicans, though, argued Kavanaugh is highly qualified, saying Democrats aren’t making a case that he doesn’t have the experience to sit on the high court.

“If it's not about his judicial record, what is this fight about?” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said. “I believe this fight is nothing more and nothing less than an attempt by our Democratic colleagues to relitigate the 2016 presidential election.”

Harris, the California Democratic senator, took issue with Kavanaugh’s past work, saying has a history of carrying out “deeply conservative partisan agendas.”

“If we look at his record on the D.C. Circuit, and in his recent writings and statements, it is clear that the nominee has brought his political bias to the bench,” Harris said.

But Republicans argued some records sought by Democrats, from Kavanaugh’s time in the White House, are irrelevant to how he'd serve as a justice.

“The question before us today is not what does Brett Kavanaugh think 11 years ago on a policy matter,” Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse said. “The question is whether or not he has the temperament and character to take his policy views and political preferences and put them in a box marked irrelevant and set it aside every morning when he puts on the black robe.”

Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch.

“My judicial philosophy is straightforward,” Kavanaugh said Tuesday. “A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. A judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.”

The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee.

Republicans command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, which would return to 51-49 once a Republican successor to the late Sen. John McCain is seated. While the hearing was ongoing, former Sen. Jon Kyl was named to that seat.

Republicans have little margin for error, though Vice President Pence can break a tie.

Republicans have said they hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lashed out at Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., Thursday after the lawmaker asked whether President Trump's foreign policy was guided by ""personal conflicts of interest.""

""Given that the president refuses to disclose his tax returns,"" Udall asked Pompeo during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, ""how can you assure the American people that American foreign policy is free of his personal conflicts of interest?""

After a pause, Pompeo told Udall that he found the question ""bizarre,"" to which Udall answered: ""You don't want to answer it, then? You just want to describe it as bizarre and not give me an answer?""

""I think that’s indicative of my answer, Senator,"" Pompeo responded. ""I’ve been incredibly involved in this administration’s foreign policy now for some 16 months and I have seen literally no evidence of what you are scurrilously, scurrilously suggesting.

""It is an outrageous suggestion.""

Udall shot back that his question was not scurrilous, saying ""this has been raised by a number of people out there.""

""Yes, sir, yes, sir it has,"" answered Pompeo with a sarcastic chuckle. ""You want me to tell you who those folks are and what their political interest may well be?""

""No, I know, it's fake news,"" said Udall sardonically.

The exchange was a notably contentious moment during a hearing that focused on the cancellation of a planned summit between Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

Trump was repeatedly criticized during the 2016 election campaign for not releasing copies of his tax returns. At the time, Trump claimed his returns were under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and said he’d release them once the review was complete.

"Former Arizona State Sen. Kelli Ward held a news conference Monday to apologize over a suggestion — hours before Sen. John McCain’s death was reported Saturday — that his family’s earlier announcement that he was ending cancer treatment was timed to hurt her Senate campaign.

“I do understand how many could have misconstrued my comments as insensitive, and for this I apologize,” Ward, who ran against McCain in the 2016 GOP primary, told reporters at her campaign headquarters.

“The media quickly ran with a false narrative that I was being insensitive to Sen. McCain at a time when he found himself in dire straits,” Ward said at the news conference. “To be clear, my comments were in no way directed at Sen. McCain or at his family or his team.”

She noted that her issues with McCain weren’t personal — ”our differences were always strictly political.”

Ward, as Fox News previously reported, made the suggestion about the McCain announcement in response to a Facebook post by a campaign aide. According to screenshots of the conversation posted on Twitter by Arizona political reporters, the aide, Jonathan Williams, wondered if it was “just a coincidence” that the announcement of McCain ending medical treatment came the day Ward was launching a statewide bus tour, her big push before Tuesday’s primary.

After her response was tweeted out, Ward deleted the post, and replaced it with one claiming the media were concocting a story.

McCain, a war hero who survived five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, served three decades in Congress and went on to become the Republican Party’s nominee for president in 2008, died Saturday. He was 81.

On Tuesday, Ward faces the frontrunner Rep. Martha McSally and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio for the GOP nomination to replace Sen. Jeff Flake. Despite Flake’s outspoken opposition to the president, as Fox News previously reported, all three candidates have expressed support for Trump. Whoever wins the primary likely will face a tough Democratic challenge, as top Democrats have said the seat could be flipped in November.

After the news conference, Arpaio tweeted in response: ”Dr. @kelliwardaz once again uses a tragedy as an excuse to praise herself. Her press conference today was shameful and clearly shows that she will always skirt the real issues in order to con voters into supporting her.”

Ward also pushed back on a tweet she sent Monday morning: “Political correctness is like a cancer!” Standing by the tweet during the news conference, she said she felt her style and voice were being muzzled by political correctness.

“I’m not a robot. I’m not an automaton. I’m not somebody who’s programmed with talking points,” Ward said. “I don’t mean to offend people, I just mean to speak directly to people, and I think that’s why people want me in this race.”",politics
"Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech investor who supported President Trump during his presidential bid, praised the president’s honesty on Monday and said the president isn’t a “zombie.”

""I fully understand why people think of President Trump as a rude, mean person. But I think that’s often better than telling beautiful lies about the way the country is working,"" Thiel said.

He said Trump was the only candidate to avoid political correctness.

"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said Wednesday the panel has mulled over the idea of inviting Chief Justice John Roberts to testify before Congress as a part of his committee’s investigation into the FISA courts.

In an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Nunes was asked if he spoke with Roberts over his findings of intelligence abuse by the Justice Department and FBI during the 2016 Trump campaign, The Hill reported.

“This is something that we grappled with,” said Nunes, speaking of his fellow committee members.

As chief justice, Roberts appoints FISA court judges.

“We decided that we wanted to complete the FISA abuse portion before we approached the courts. Our next step with the courts is to make them aware, if they’re not aware already that this happened by watching the news. So we will be sending a letter to the court.”

Nunes added that the committee struggles with its next step because of the “separation of powers issue.”

“There is a, there’s a debate now into whether just send it to the Supreme Court or to send it to the FISA Court,” he said, referring to the letter.

“If, somehow, this case ends up at the Supreme Court, somehow, some way, by sending a letter to Roberts, do you conflict the court?”

NUNES TELLS FOX NEWS MEMO WAS RELEASED OUT OF PUBLIC OBLIGATION

Just last week the House Intelligence Committee released a four-page memo, written by Nunes, alleging intelligence abuse by the DOJ and FBI during the 2016 Trump campaign, citing a high-ranking government official who said both agencies never would have sought surveillance warrants in the absence of a disputed anti-Trump dossier funded by Democrats.

When speaking about the likelihood that Roberts would talk to the committee, Nunes said that he was “not aware of any time where a judge has, for lack of a better term, testified before the Congress.”",politics
"Democrats looking for a shocking underdog win in a special election in Ohio on Tuesday are hoping not only to snatch a House seat in a historically Republican district, but also to energize their national effort to fight President Trump's agenda and reclaim a congressional majority.

Ohio's 12th Congressional District, in the suburbs of Columbus, has had a Republican representative for 35 years, and has been largely in GOP hands since 1920. But a poll released Monday by Monmouth University showed that Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson, 56, leads upstart challenger Danny O'Connor, 31, by just one percentage point.

Trump, who won the wealthy and highly educated district by double-digits in 2016, went all-in for Balderson with a last-minute rally on Saturday night in a sweltering auditorium that Trump said hit ""110 degrees,"" ruining his ""brand-new, beautiful suit."" Former President Obama took the district by several percentage points in 2008.

“A vote for Danny boy and the Democrats is a vote to let criminals and drugs pour into our country,” Trump said. “And to let MS-13 run wild in our communities. And you know what they do once they’re there.”

The president went on to describe O'Connor as a ""puppet"" for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. O'Connor once vowed not to vote for Pelosi to again lead the party, but later backtracked, saying he would support the 78-year-old if it was necessary to retake the House.

Trump also defiantly questioned the idea that historically, the party that controls the White House suffers significant losses in the midterms, declaring, ""but I say why?""

Balderson narrowly won the Republican primary for the seat earlier this year amid a crowded field, and campaigned largely as a loyal Trump supporter. He said he would help ""build Trump’s wall and defend Christian values"" in an advertisement.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- who often has criticized Trump since running against him for the GOP presidential nomination -- also has endorsed Balderson, saying he is a ""partner in turning around Ohio as we passed tax cuts and balanced the budget.""

WATCH: TRUMP SLAMS DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE INCRUCIAL OHIO ELECTION IN SWELTERING RALLY

“It’s really kind of shocking because this should be just a slam dunk [for Republicans] and it’s not,"" Kasich said on ABC News’ “This Week” on Sunday, adding that he believed Balderson would win.

“But it really doesn’t bode well for the Republican Party because this ... shouldn’t even be contested,"" Kasich said.

Balderson has other high-profile Republican support. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, also briefly took the stage during the rally at the request of the president, and was met with chants from the crowd supporting him for the House speakership.

Top Republicans hoped that Balderson's support from both moderates like Kasich and avowed Trump supporters in Washington would draw a large, diverse crowd of supporters to the polls on Tuesday. Balderson himself touted his array of endorsements, telling reporters this week he had ""unified the Republican Party.""

The Aug. 7 special election to replace retired Rep. Pat Tiberi will be seen as a bellwether for the upcoming midterms in November, and a clear referendum on Trump and Republican leaders including Jordan.

A Quinnipiac University Poll found that Democrats have opened a 12-point lead on the generic House ballot -- a gap that Republicans had almost closed just a few months ago.

Several other states will hold primaries on Tuesday, but Ohio's special election promises to be the last major partisan test ahead of the November midterms.

The array of midterm-season nomination contests has proven confusing even for Washington insiders. Trump last week erroneously told voters in Ohio to ""get out and vote"" for Rep. Steve Stivers, who already had won the GOP nomination for his House seat earlier this year. He later deleted the tweet and posted his endorsement of Balderson.

"A Georgia Democrat running for Congress was arrested this week and now awaits sentencing after a jury convicted him over a drunken-driving incident from last year.

Steven Lamar Foster, 61, was convicted by a Dalton jury Monday for driving under the influence on the evening of Sept. 23, 2017, according to Whitfield County Superior Court documents.

The former physician, a Democratic congressional candidate in Georgia’s 14th District, was ordered to jail without bond until his sentencing on Monday.

According to police, Foster was pulled over for driving with his headlights off after dark. Foster reportedly told the officer he “had not been drunk since 1981” and would “give him a breath test if he wanted to.” The officer reportedly then asked why Foster might need to take a breath test.

Foster later admitted to the officer that he'd consumed two or three beers about three hours earlier; the police report said he swayed and stumbled during a field sobriety test. A Breathalyzer test also showed his blood alcohol content was 0.103.

Foster’s campaign office did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment.

Foster started his campaign in March, six months after his DUI arrest. He described himself as a ""physician entrepreneur"" on his qualifying paperwork for the congressional race, despite state records showing Foster's medical license had expired at the end of 2003.

Further, the Composite State Board of Medical Examiners suspended Foster's medical license indefinitely in October 2002, citing concerns that he was ""unable to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety to patients due to a psychiatric disorder.""

Foster has been running for a seat held by Rep. Tom Graves since 2010.

"FBI official Peter Strzok's first public hearing tumbled into a rancorous and heated political fracas on Thursday, as Republicans clashed with Democrats as well as the former investigator over his anti-Trump texts -- and even threatened contempt for initially refusing to answer questions on the Russia probe.

Strzok, throughout it all, remained defiant and maintained that he did not show bias in those infamous messages with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page.

Republicans sharply disputed that assessment, with Rep. Darrell Issa later making Strzok read examples of those texts aloud. Among them, Strzok read one message where he called Trump a ""disaster,"" and another calling him an ""idiot.""

The initial contempt threat surfaced after House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., questioned ""how many witnesses"" Strzok interviewed before an August 2016 text from Strzok to Page stating ""we'll stop"" then-candidate Trump from becoming president.

Strzok said he was not able to answer the question based on instructions from FBI counsel. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., rejected Strzok's claim.

""Mr. Strzok, you are under subpoena and required to answer the question,"" Goodlatte said.

This touched off a heated dispute. Judiciary Ranking Member Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., blasted Goodlatte for putting Strzok in an ""impossible position,"" while Strzok claimed he was there voluntarily. Goodlatte said Strzok could only consult with his own attorney, not the FBI's. Several other committee members chimed in, blasting top Republicans on the committee, with Nadler even motioning to adjourn the hearing all together.

Goodlatte, instead, said that at the conclusion of the hearing, Strzok would be subject to ""recall to allow the committee to consider proceeding with a contempt citation.""

However, hours later after a break in the hearing, Strzok returned to say that he was advised by FBI counsel that he could in fact answer Gowdy's earlier question.

But after Gowdy asked it again, Strzok replied only: ""I don't recall. I'd have to check the case file.""

""That's eerily similar to what you said a couple of hours ago. I'm looking for a number,"" Gowdy said. ""You don't recall interviews conducted in the first week of an investigation you originated?""

Strzok maintained that he did not remember, which touched off another heated exchange with Gowdy.

It was one of many throughout the hours-long hearing, which began with Strzok asserting that his political opinions were rooted in ""deep patriotism.""

Strzok said in his prepared opening statement that he has never allowed personal opinions to affect his work, that he knew information during the campaign that had the potential to damage then-candidate Trump but never contemplated leaking it to the press, and that recent congressional focus on him is misguided and plays into “our enemies’ campaign to tear America apart.”

""Like many people, I had and expressed personal political opinions during an extraordinary presidential election. Many contained expressions of concern for the security of our country,"" Strzok said in his opening statement, adding that those opinions were expressed ""out of deep patriotism.""

Gowdy also tore into Strzok at the opening of Thursday's hearing, saying he showed ""textbook bias"" on the job.

This later escalated into a heated exchange in which Strzok claimed he was kicked off Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe because of ""perception,"" not because of bias.

After Strzok said he didn't ""appreciate"" how Gowdy was characterizing those events, the congressman fired back:

“I don’t give a damn what you appreciate, Agent Strzok.”

Strzok, in that exchange, also said he doesn't even remember sending the ""stop"" Trump text, noting it was written late at night, ""in shorthand.""

He maintained he was not suggesting he or the FBI would take any action to influence Trump's candidacy.

Strzok, getting fired up, later added, ""The suggestion that I, in some dark chamber in the FBI, would somehow cast aside these procedures ... and somehow be able to do this is astounding to me.""

Gowdy and Goodlatte both rattled off a slew of Strzok text messages in which he blasted then-candidate Donald Trump and pined for a Hillary Clinton victory in 2016, to underscore their bias allegations.

As Strzok observed opening statements from the witness table, Gowdy expressed disbelief that he didn't view such statements as bias.

Despite inspector general findings, Strzok maintained that bias was not ""expressed in those text messages.""

""I can tell you that those text messages are not indicative of bias,"" Strzok said.

Goodlatte also challenged Democrats to replace Trump's name in those texts with their own.

“To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, please replace President Trump’s name with your own name in a small sample of things Mr. Strzok has said,” Goodlatte said. “Envision how you would feel if you found out that the chief agent investigating you as a Member of Congress was making these comments: 'F Trump,' 'Trump is a disaster,' 'Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart. I could SMELL the Trump support' – or, perhaps most alarmingly and revealingly, 'We’ll stop it' – referring directly to Mr. Trump’s candidacy for President.”

Democrats, in opening statements, blasted their GOP colleagues. Rep. Elijah Cummings highlighted that several Trump-tied figures have already been snagged in the Russia probe.

""These are not allegations, these are admissions,"" he said, while displaying posters with images of the defendants in that case.

Strzok has been in political crosshairs for months over revelations of anti-Trump text messages exchanged with Page.

Strzok’s messages were first revealed by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The latest text, which was revealed in the inspector general’s report on the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email investigation, showed Strzok vowing to “stop” Trump from becoming president.

Lawmakers were grilling Strzok on the impact of his political bias on any investigative decisions, though Horowitz ultimately found that despite the politically charged messages, there was no evidence that the bias had an impact on any prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton probe.

Strzok was on Mueller’s team until the text messages were discovered. He was then reassigned to the FBI’s office of human resources. Just last month, Strzok was escorted from the bureau and lost his security clearance.

Strzok also repeatedly said he regretted how his text messages were phrased, noting that they should be put into context. During his private deposition last month, Strzok also said he regretted sending the text messages all together.

In his opening statement though, Strzok maintained that while his criticisms of Trump were “blunt,” there is “simply no evidence of bias in my professional actions.”

“Let me be clear, unequivocally and under oath: not once in my 26 years of defending my nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took,” Strzok said Thursday adding that Russian election interference has been successfully “sowing discord in our nation and shaking faith in our institutions.”

“I have the utmost respect for Congress’s oversight role, but I truly believe that today’s hearing is just another victory notch in Putin’s belt and another milestone in our enemies’ campaign to tear America apart,” Strzok said. “As someone who loves this country and cherishes its ideals, it is profoundly painful to watch and even worse to play a part in.”

Strzok also rejected Trump’s characterization of the Mueller probe as a “witch hunt.”

Strzok’s public testimony comes after his appearance on Capitol Hill last month, when he interviewed with the committees behind closed doors for more than 11 hours.

Strzok was romantically involved with Page, who resigned from the bureau in May. Page also served on brief detail for Mueller, but returned to the FBI last July where she served in the Office of General Counsel.

This week, Page defied a congressionally issued subpoena to appear Wednesday for a closed-door deposition before the same committees. Page’s legal team, late Tuesday night, said she would not testify because she needed more time to prepare.

House Republicans sent a letter to Page’s attorney on Wednesday, laying out three options for Page: show up at Thursday’s public hearing alongside Strzok, attend a closed-door deposition on Friday or face contempt of Congress proceedings beginning Friday morning.

Goodlatte, R-Va., said Thursday morning that Page, through her attorney, has agreed to appear for a private interview on Friday, voluntarily.

Trump, from his European tour, blasted Page for failing to show up on Wednesday, calling the ongoing Russia probe “perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER!”

He added: “How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok? Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear!”

"The Democratic National Committee voted Saturday to limit the influence of superdelegates -- part of a series of changes to the presidential nominating process to reunite the party after a fractious 2016 primary process.

The reforms, passed at the body’s summer meeting in Chicago, include a measure that requires superdelegates to refrain from voting on the first presidential nomination ballot, unless a candidate has enough votes from pledged delegates.



Superdelegates are the party’s most high-profile members and include governors, members of Congress, mayors and others, and represent 15 percent of the overall delegate count. Unliked pledged delegates, they are not locked to a candidate.

OCASIO-CORTEZ CLAIMS SOLIDARITY WITH CAB DRIVERS - WHILE CAMPAIGN BUYS RIDES FROM UBER, OTHER 'ALTERNATIVES', FEC DATA SHOWS

The reform means that for the initial vote, candidates will only be able to count on the delegates they won during state primaries and caucuses. If there is need for a second ballot, then superdelegates -- who are not bound to a candidate -- can step in.



Supporters of the superdelegate system say that it offers greater diversity, but opponents say it gives too much weight to the party establishment and prevents grassroots candidates.

The superdelegrate system was a thorn in the side of backers of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who claimed the deck was stacked against him in 2016 when he ran in the primary against eventual nominee Hillary Clinton. In that race, superdelegates overwhelmingly backed Clinton.

MICHAEL AVENATTI MAKES SURPRISE VISIT TO DNC SUMMER MEETING

In the end, Clinton's lead with superdelegates did not make a crucial difference, because she held a lead of pledged delegates. But critics of the superdelegate structure say that tallies appeared to give Clinton a bigger edge than she had because of the superdelegates.

“Today is a historic day for our party. We passed major reforms that will not only put our next presidential nominee in the strongest position possible, but will help us elect Democrats up and down the ballot, across the country,” DNC Chair Tom Perez said in a statement.

“These reforms will help grow our party, unite Democrats, and restore voters’ trust by making our 2020 nominating process the most inclusive and transparent in our history,"" he said.

Sanders backed the move in a statement on Twitter.

""Today's decision by the DNC is an important step forward in making the Democratic Party more open, democratic and responsive to the input of ordinary Americans,"" he tweeted. ""This has been a long and arduous process, and I want to thank @TomPerez and all of those who made it happen.""

But some have objected to the move, with DNC member Bob Mulholland telling The Associated Press that Sanders' backers have held undue influence over the party since 2016.

""Three months before the midterms, and this is what Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez have us discussing? Such fools,"" Mulholland, who backed Clinton in 2016, said.

Other reforms passed include requiring caucuses to have absentee voting or another mechanism to ensure participation.

"Press Secretary Sarah Sanders took her long-running feud with CNN’s Jim Acosta to a new level during Thursday’s White House briefing, blasting the media for personal attacks against her and accusing the press of debasing the discourse in America.

The press secretary was responding to similar allegations leveled against President Trump. Specifically, Acosta asked Sanders to say whether the press is indeed the “enemy of the people,” as her boss has controversially claimed, after Ivanka Trump broke with her father on the statement at an Axios event earlier Thursday.

“I think it would be a good thing if you were to say right here, at this briefing, that the press … are not the enemy of the people. I think we deserve that,” Acosta told Sanders.

Sanders pointed out that President Trump has “made his position known,” before the CNN senior White House correspondent interrupted – resulting in Sanders and Acosta talking over each other. From there, Sanders launched into a point-by-point rebuttal.

“It’s ironic, Jim, that not only you and the media attack the president for his rhetoric when they frequently lower the level of conversation in this country. Repeatedly, repeatedly the media resorts to personal attacks without any content other than to incite anger,” Sanders fired back.

She went on to say the media have attacked her personally “on a number of occasions” before specifically calling out rhetoric she said aired on CNN.

“Including your own network said I should be harassed as a life sentence. That I should be choked. ICE officials are not welcomed in their place of worship,” Sanders said.

Sanders then took aim at April’s White House Correspondents Dinner where comedian Michelle Wolf took personal jabs at the press secretary while mocking her job performance, Southern roots and appearance.

“When I was hosted by the Correspondents’ Association, which almost all of you are members of, you brought a comedian up to attack my appearance and call me a traitor to my own gender."" - Sarah Sanders

“When I was hosted by the Correspondents’ Association, which almost all of you are members of, you brought a comedian up to attack my appearance and call me a traitor to my own gender,” Sanders said. “As far as I know, I’m the first press secretary in the history of the United States that’s required Secret Service protection.”

Sanders said the media “continues to ratchet up the verbal assault against the president,” noting that the administration has a “role to play” but the media are also responsible for the discourse in America.

Acosta then reminded Sanders that she did not say whether or not she considers the media the “enemy of the people.”

“Are we to take it, from what you just said, we all get put through the ringer. We all get put in the meat grinder in this town and you’re no exception,” Acosta said. “I’m sorry that that happened to you. I wish that had not happened. But, for the sake of this room. The people that are in this room, this democracy, this country … the president of the United States should not refer to us as the enemy of the people … all I’m asking you to do, Sarah, is to acknowledge that.”

Sanders did not directly respond to Acosta’s question, but complimented his hunger for a response.

“I appreciate your passion. I share it. I’ve addressed this question. I’ve addressed my personal feelings, I’m here to speak on behalf of the president. He’s made his comments clear,” Sanders said.

Acosta didn’t approve of Sanders’ response and took to Twitter to express his feelings.

“I walked out of the end of that briefing because I am totally saddened by what just happened. Sarah Sanders was repeatedly given a chance to say the press is not the enemy and she wouldn't do it. Shameful,” he wrote.",politics
"President Barack Obama was veritably shell-shocked in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory in 2016, and even asked aides “What if we were wrong?” as he struggled to come to terms with Hillary Clinton's defeat, former adviser Ben Rhodes writes in a new memoir coming out in June.

The book, titled ""The World As It Is,"" highlights efforts by Obama's brain trust to reassure him that he would have won re-election if he were allowed to run for a third term.

But Obama remained alternately optimistic and dejected, according to Rhodes, who has been feted as an aspiring novelist-turned national security wunderkind.

“Sometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early,” Obama told aides, according to the memoir. “Maybe we pushed too far. ... Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.”

“There are more stars in the sky than grains of sand on the earth,"" the book quotes Obama saying in a message to Rhodes the day after the election.

""Maybe this is what people want."" - Former President Barack Obama, trying to understand Donald Trump's election win

Days later, Obama reportedly came back down to Earth, saying: “Maybe this is what people want. I’ve got the economy set up well for him. No facts. No consequences. They can just have a cartoon.”

Rhodes was promoted from presidential speechwriter to deputy national security adviser under Obama. He held that post during the raid that killed Usama bin Laden, as well as the U.S. intervention in Libya and the signing of the Iran nuclear deal.

The possibility that Trump could unravel that legacy apparently weighed on Obama, Rhodes writes.

FMR OBAMA OFFICIALS FORM ANTI-TRUMP THINK TANK

“I feel like Michael Corleone,"" Obama reportedly said, referencing ""The Godfather"" character as he prepared to hand over the White House to Trump. ""I almost got out.”

According to Rhodes, he and Obama were not aware that the FBI had begun an investigation into the Trump campaign's dealings with Russia until after the election.

The book also touches on some foreign-policy melodrama as Obama made his exit from the world stage, amid a shifting geopolitical climate that included Brexit and rising disenchantment with globalism.

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had a ""single tear in her eye"" when she and Obama parted for the last time, and Obama noted that ""she's all alone"" to defend his liberal principles, according to Rhodes.

BEN RHODES JOKES ABOUT GOP LEADERS' 'OBITS'

In footage from an HBO documentary recording on election night in 2016, Rhodes himself was seen sitting alone outside on a bench, haltingly repeating that the situation was difficult to ""process.""

But in his memoir, Rhodes says he should have predicted the result.

“I couldn’t shake the feeling that I should have seen it coming,” he writes. “Because when you distilled it, stripped out the racism and misogyny, we’d run against Hillary eight years ago with the same message Trump had used: She’s part of a corrupt establishment that can’t be trusted to bring change.”",politics
"Sen. Lindsey Graham is calling on the Justice Department to set the record straight about an alleged meeting involving then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, agent Peter Strzok and attorney Lisa Page, in which “an insurance policy” against a possible Trump victory in the 2016 election purportedly was discussed.

In a letter obtained by Fox News, Graham, R-S.C., formally asked Inspector General Michael Horowitz to resolve conflicting statements about a meeting discussed in text messages between Strzok and Page, his colleague and lover.

In a text from Strzok to Page dated Aug. 15, 2016, the pair discussed “an insurance policy” in the event that Donald Trump went on to win the presidential election.

“I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office – that there’s no way he gets elected – but I’m afraid we can’t take the risk. It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40,” the text read.

Horowitz confirmed in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday that “Andy” referred to McCabe.

If it is true that McCabe was present for such a discussion, it would “show bias and inappropriate behavior at the highest levels of the FBI,” Graham said.

“I think there’s been an attitude of ignorance toward the truth by President Trump,” he said.

Carter had earlier remained quiet on Trump but praised him recently for his efforts with North Korea and a peace treaty.

“If President Trump is successful in getting a peace treaty that’s acceptable to both sides with North Korea, I think he certainly ought to be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize,” the former president told Politico in May.

However, he did question Trump’s character in the same interview.

“I think the president ought to tell the truth. I think the president ought to be for peace. I think the president ought to treat everybody equally. So, equality and peace and the truth, and I’d say basic justice are some of the moral values that I think every person should have,” Carter said.

"The Pentagon says it has suspended $300 milllion in military aid to Pakistan for not doing enough to battle terrorists groups inside its borders.

The announcement comes ahead of an expected trip to Islamabad by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the U.S. military’s top officer, Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

In January, the Pentagon suspended nearly $1 billion in aid to Pakistan for what Defense Secretary James Mattis and other top officials said at the time was Islamabad’s failure to take on the Haqqani terrorist network.

That network is believed to be holding western hostages, including Kevin King, a U.S. professor from American University in Kabul who was abducted along with an Australian colleague two years ago. King was last seen in a ""proof-of-life"" video, released last October.

At the time of the January announcement, the Pentagon said Pakistan could earn back some of the cash from the U.S. if it did more to stop the Haqqani network and other terrorist groups.",world
"On four occasions, the FBI told the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) court that it ""did not believe"" former British spy Christopher Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating former Trump aide Carter Page in Russian collusion, newly released documents reveal.

Instead, the FBI suggested to the court, the September 2016 article by Michael Isikoff was independent corroboration of the salacious, unverified allegations against Trump in the infamous Steele Dossier. Federal authorities used both the Steele Dossier and Yahoo News article to convince the FISA court to authorize a surveillance warrant for Page.

But London court records show that contrary to the FBI's assessments, Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS -- the opposition research firm behind the dossier.

The revelations are contained in heavily-redacted documents released over the weekend after a Freedom of Information lawsuit by the organization Judicial Watch.

The materials released by the DOJ include an October 2016 application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap Page as well as several renewal applications.

The FBI's assessment that Steele was not the direct source of the Yahoo News article is contained in all of the released FISA applications, including a renewal in June 2017.

""The FBI does not believe that Source #1 [Steele] directly provided this information to the identified news organization that published the September 23rd News Article,"" the FBI states in one of the released FISA documents. ""Source #1 told the FBI that he/she only provided this information to the business associate and the FBI.""

DOJ RELEASES FISA DOCS THAT SERVED AS BASIS FOR WARRANT AGAINST CARTER PAGE

The documents describe Source #1 as someone ""hired by a business associate to conduct research"" into Trump's Russia ties -- but do not mention that Fusion GPS was funded by the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign.

Instead, the documents say only: ""The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit [Trump's] campaign.""

Fox News believes that the U.S. person is Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS.

The FBI describes Steele in the documents as ""credible"" and ""reliable,"" but noted that it suspended its relationship with him in October 2016 because of his ""unauthorized disclosures to the press.""

The unredacted FISA materials also contain only limited references to ex-Trump adviser George Papadopoulos. Media reports had speculated that Papadopoulos' 2016 meeting in London with a professor who had ties to Russia was a key justification for the FISA-authorized surveillance of Page.

Papadopoulos has since pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe.

GOWDY: CARTER PAGE MORE LIKE 'INSPECTOR GADGET THAN JASON BOURNE'

Reacting to the document release, Page told Fox News, ""I'm having trouble finding any small bit of this document that rises above complete ignorance and/or insanity.""

Critics have charged that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who signed off on the FISA application renewals, should not have approved them without more reliable intelligence.

In a series of tweets early Sunday, President Trump called the FISA documents proof of a ""witch-hunt"" and a ""scam,"" and praised Judicial Watch for obtaining the documents.

But Democrats countered that the release had, in fact, vindicated the FBI.

""These documents affirm that our nation faced a profound counterintelligence threat prior to the 2016 election, and the Department of Justice and FBI took appropriate steps to investigate whether any U.S. persons were acting as an agent of a foreign power,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif, who serves as ranking member of the House intelligence committee, said in a statement.

“FBI and DOJ would have been negligent had they not used all the tools at their disposal, including Court-authorized [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] FISA surveillance, to protect the country,"" he added.

"After jurors were dismissed Monday in the Paul Manafort trial Monday, the federal judge overseeing the case and prosecutors trying the former Trump campaign chairman got into an extended verbal debate -- lasting about 10 minutes -- over the merits of the prosecution, the length of the case and even the eye contact of prosecutor Greg Andres.

U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III specifically pushed Andres on why the prosecution was moving slowly with Rick Gates – the former Manafort business partner who testified on Monday – and specifically to describe the link between wealthy Ukrainian politicos and Manafort. Ellis argued that the connection was not the basis of the case.

“What matters are the allegations that he made money from them and didn’t report it,” Ellis said. “You don't need to throw mud at these people.”

“I don’t know if they are bad or good. And I don’t care,” Ellis argued, reiterating his previous claim that the prosecution seemed to be focusing not on the actual charges but on what he considered “political contributions.”

Ellis again compared the Ukrainians in question to American billionaires and “Mr. Koch and Mr. Soros” as political contributors.

“I don’t know why you keep bringing (up) these people,” Andres said, referring to the Ukrainians. “These people are not like any Americans. These people are oligarchs and that means they control a segment of the economy based on the governments allowing them to do that.”’

“These are not really political contributions,” he continued. “They are self-serving payments with respect to what oligarchs do.”

“That makes it even clearer to me that it doesn’t have anything to do with the allegations in this case,” Ellis responded. “It throws dirt on these people. They may deserve it. I don’t know - and I don’t care.”

At another point in the exchange Andres could be heard challenging Ellis on a technicality. “Respectfully, judge, that is not what the law is,” Andres responded bluntly at one point.

The most heated moment of the debate, however, took place when Ellis got perturbed by Andres not looking up at him while speaking.

“Look at me! Don’t look down,” Ellis demanded.

Then, when Andres responded that he was looking at a relevant document, the exchange grew testier.

“You looked down as if to say ‘that’s B.S.!’” Ellis said. “I’m up here!”

WHO IS TS ELLIS? A LOOK AT THE JUDGE IN THE MANAFORT, MUELLER CASE

Manafort, 69, faces tax evasion and bank fraud charges as he is accused of hiding a “significant percentage” of income earned from his Ukrainian work from the IRS. He also is accused of fraudulently obtaining millions more in bank loans, including while he was working on the Trump campaign.

Held in Alexandria, Virginia, the case is the first for Special Counsel Robert Mueller since his appointment to oversee the Russia investigation in May 2017. It started on July 31 and is expected to last about three weeks.

Both Manafort and Gates were indicted last October, accused in a multimillion-dollar money-laundering conspiracy tied to lobbying work for a Russia-friendly Ukrainian political party.

Mueller dropped the 22 tax and bank fraud charges against Gates after the former business partner of Manafort agreed to plead guilty.

Another three hours of Gates testimony, according to Andres, is scheduled for Tuesday.

"Former Republican senator Jon Kyl was named Tuesday to succeed the late Sen. John McCain, with the announcement coming at the start of confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh -- which could be the new senator's first big vote.

Arizona GOP Gov. Doug Ducey announced the selection via Twitter, while saying during a subsequent news conference that Arizonans needed a person who would be able to ""hit the ground running.""

""I am deeply grateful to Senator Kyl for agreeing to succeed his friend and colleague of so many years. Every single day that Jon Kyl represents #Arizona in the U.S. Senate is a day our state is well-served,"" he tweeted.

Kyl, 76, may be a short-term pick. He only committed Tuesday to fill the Senate seat until early next year out of a ""sense of duty.""

""I haven't been able to get that assurance from Kyl yet, what I have gotten is a commitment to serve Arizona through at least this session of Congress,"" Ducey told reporters, adding that he hoped that Kyl ""serves longer.""

Kyl told reporters he did not want to commit for a longer period because when he left his Senate seat previously he had no intention of returning.

""In that spirit I am certainly willing to serve through the end of this session,"" he said.

Voters in 2020 will get to decide who fills the remainder of McCain's term through 2022. Then the seat will be up again for a full six-year term.

McCain's widow Cindy McCain had revealed the choice in an earlier tweet, saying, ""Jon Kyl is a dear friend of mine and John’s. It’s a great tribute to John that he is prepared to go back into public service to help the state of Arizona.""

Kyl was the GOP whip for a number of years, and also served as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s escort or “sherpa,” as the Senate sometimes calls it, taking Kavanaugh around to meet with senators.

He was absent at Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing on Tuesday, but Ducey told reporters that Kyl is ready to cast a vote after working with the White House for months on the Kavanaugh nomination.

The political stakes are high since Kyl could participate in the vote on whether to confirm Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, and will be rejoining the Senate at a time when Democrats are eager to take control of the chamber in this year's midterms.

A representative for Ducey told the Arizona Republic that if Kyl opted to step down at the end of the session, the Republican governor would have to appoint another replacement.

JOHN MCCAIN BURIED AT NAVAL ACADEMY NEXT TO LIFELONG FRIEND

Kyl retired in 2013 after becoming the No. 2 ranking Republican senator, and served alongside McCain during his 18 years in the Senate.

Filling McCain's seat marks a turning point in Arizona political history. That seat in particular has been held by two men who were heralded as giants of the Senate: McCain took the seat once held by Sen. Barry Goldwater after he had served in the House of Representatives.

Outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., called Kyl a ""great pick"" as McCain's replacement, and that it was Ducey's selection entirely.

“They worked together for eighteen years they served together so you know I think he’ll fit right in and he obviously shared Senator McCain’s view on most things and [is the] perfect, perfect guy to succeed him,"" Flake told Fox News.

McCain was buried on Sunday at the U.S. Naval Academy in a private ceremony, as per the wishes the Arizona Republican and 2008 presidential nominee who died Aug. 25 from brain cancer at age 81.

"United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the U.N. is running out of money and is urging members to pay up amid a looming financial crisis for the international body.



In a letter to staff this week, seen by Fox News, Guterres says he has warned member states of a “troubling financial situation facing the United Nations,"" which he says is caused by late payments to the U.N. by member states.



“Our cash flow has never been this low so early in the calendar year, and the broader trend is also concerning; we are running out of cash sooner and staying in the red longer,” he says.



'Our cash flow has never been this low so early in the calendar year.' - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres

Guterres went on to say that the organization will be taking measures to look at reducing costs, in a way that won’t affect their mission. He said he also will be proposing to states various steps to strengthen financial stability at the U.N.

Trump administration threats to cut funding do not appear to be directly linked to the cash crunch.

While the administration has been eyeing carefully its payments to various U.N. funds and agencies, the U.S. has not yet reduced or delayed its payments to the budget, though due to the fall start of the U.S. fiscal year, payments usually come later in the year.



Secretary-General spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Thursday that the issue is “late payments and payments not yet received to the regular budget.”



“Late payment has an impact obviously on our cash flow. It may have an impact on our ability to deliver mandates,” he said.



However, Hugh Dugan, a former U.S. diplomat at the U.N., said that other countries could be mimicking what is perceived as the U.S. backing away from its commitments at the body of diplomacy and international relations.



“A look at the record shows that Trump has continued to fund it at historic levels, chose it to sanction North Korea, and uses it as a platform to defend Israel. However, there is a wide misperception fed by Trump detractors and a combative media that his Administration has walked away from the U.N.,” Dugan, who is also a professor at Seton Hall University’s School of Diplomacy and International Relations, said.

“Other countries mimic the U.S., and what they hear has led them to go slow on support and check writing,” he said.

Earlier this year, the U.S. withheld funding to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).

HALEY PRESSURES ARAB STATES TO STEP UP ON PALESTINIAN AID: 'WE ARE NOT FOOLS'



Guterres’ call for members to cough up the cash, meanwhile, mimics the pressure the Trump administration has been putting on countries at both the U.N. and at NATO to fulfill their commitments.



On Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley urged Arab states to provide more funding for Palestinians.



""Americans are very generous people. We are humanitarian oriented. And we continue to seek out ways to help the Palestinian people, whose plight is of genuine concern to us,"" she said.

“But we are not fools. If we extend a hand in friendship and generosity, we do not expect our hand to be bitten. And as we extend our hand, we also expect others to extend theirs as well.”",politics
"The Finnish government reportedly announced Tuesday that it will end the country’s universal basic income program by year's end -- and appears to be taking on new measures to cut benefits to those who do not actively seek employment.

Finland was considered the first European country to pay a monthly check of $685 to its unemployed between ages 25 and 58. It was considered a pilot program -- serving 2,000 randomly selected jobless people -- that its founders hoped to expand.

“It’s a pity that it will end like this,” Olli Kangas, who oversees the Finnish government agency that focuses on social welfare and helped design the program, told the New York Times.

“The government has chosen to try a totally different path,” Kangas said. “Basic income is unconditional. Now, they are pursuing conditionality.”

“The government has chosen to try a totally different path. Basic income is unconditional. Now, they are pursuing conditionality.” - Olli Kangas, designer of Finland's basic income program

David Whitley summed up Finland's decision in the Orlando Sentinel.

""Proponents said the program wasn’t comprehensive enough to gauge its merits,"" Whitley wrote. ""Critics say it would have required a 30 percent tax increase on an already over-taxed population to be viable.""

But some cities, including San Francisco, continue to look into the basic income theory, the Times wrote. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2017 said that basic income should be explored “to make sure that everyone has a cushion to try new ideas.”

That was essentially Finland’s theory when announcing the pilot program.

The initial move was met with skepticism from citizens who questioned whether an unemployed young person would be motivated to find a job if they were making a steady income, albeit small.

“There is a fear that with basic income they would just stay at home and play computer games,” Heikki Hiilamo, a professor at the University of Helsinki, told the paper.",world
"The U.S. Capitol is quietest early on a Sunday morning.

No lawmakers. No aides. No tourists. No lobbyists. No journalists.

Not even overnight maintenance crews, curators or custodial workers.

Sunday is the one day of the week when the public can’t tour the Capitol. The Senate left town last Thursday and didn’t return until late Monday afternoon. The House remains on a five-week hiatus.

The Capitol subsists in solitude on Sunday morning. Recuperating. Breathing. Bereft of the hair-on-fire bustle which dominates the other days.

A deafening hush cloaked the vacant Capitol in the wee hours of Sunday morning. I was there to report on the Saturday night death of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. I passed a couple of U.S. Capitol Police officers in the underground tunnels and at the door. But as far as I could tell, we were the only people present in the immense expanse of the most-famous building in the world.

I cut through the center of the Capitol Rotunda, a cavern of emptiness on Sunday morning. That’s a stark contrast to the transformation the Rotunda will experience. The nation will focus its attention on the middle of the Rotunda on Friday.

That’s where the casket bearing McCain’s remains will rest atop an ancient, black wooden platform. McCain will become the 30th person to ever “lie in state” in the Capitol Rotunda. The first was former House Speaker and Kentucky Senator Henry Clay in 1852. The most recent was Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hi., in December, 2012.

I paused for a moment to construct the tableau in my mind’s eye. I culled scenes I witnessed from ceremonies for Inouye, President Reagan and President Ford.

The coffin. The honor guard. The family. The public.

And I always remember the sound. The muffled shuffling of feet as the crowd pinwheels around the casket.

However, on Sunday, my destination wasn’t the Capitol Rotunda. I wanted to snap a picture of the statue of Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., in the Capitol’s Statuary Hall. Goldwater was McCain’s Senate predecessor. Only Goldwater and McCain have held this particular Arizona Senate seat since January 3, 1953.

McCain came to the Senate in 1987 after two-terms in the House. McCain was stepping into the shadow of a legend in Goldwater. Yet their careers featured symbiotic parallels.

Both earned the Republican nomination for president and lost. There were questions about whether both men met the Constitutional qualifications for president.

The Constitution requires the president be “a natural born citizen.” Goldwater was born in “Arizona Territory” before it was admitted to the union in 1912. McCain was born in the U.S. Panama Canal Zone. Both chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee.

I arrived at the Goldwater statue and stared for a moment. And in the Sunday silence of Statuary Hall, I heard something.

A singular sound echoing off the marble of the Capitol. Not white noise, filling the acoustical void. There was no air conditioning blowing. No fan. No distant sound of a vacuum, or car horns, or voices ricocheting around the columns. Just a solitary ticking, inaudible during the daily commotion at the Capitol.

A statue of Clio is perched atop a doorway leading from Statuary Hall to the Speaker’s Office and the Rotunda.

Clio is the “muse of history.” Appropriately, she stands in a winged “Car of History.” The face of a clock doubles as one of the wheels of the chariot or car. Clio’s “car” signifies the unflagging march of time.

From her vantage point above the passageway, Clio stares at the Congressional comings and goings below her. She clasps a book in her left hand, documenting the events she witnesses in her journal.

The sound I heard emanated from the wheel of Clio’s history chariot.

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

Of course. The clock on the wheel of the chariot, positioned dead center above the doorway. The daily chaos which consumes the Capitol typically dampened the ticking. But this was Sunday morning. Sure. The ticking was muted. But there it was. A tiny sound. The only audible thing in the cavernous, empty Capitol.

The silent desolation of the building seemingly ballooned the milliseconds between each tick, filling a temporal chasm which seemed longer than a second. And just when you thought the next tick wouldn’t come, there it was.

Sharp.

Staccato.

Deliberate.

The ticking reminded me that the longer I stood there, I was losing time. The Capitol was barren, otherwise frozen in suspended animation. But appearances can be deceiving. Time wasn’t stopping.

John McCain ran out of time the night before. His passing - and Clio’s ticking clock -made me think of a scene I observed on many occasions.

I covered McCain for years. I’ve seen a blue ink pin explode on his starched, white dress shirt. I’ve been shouted down by McCain for asking questions too aggressively. I’ve talked baseball and hockey with him at length. But what I remember most about McCain is that he was always in a hurry.

After votes on the Senate floor, McCain would dash down to the Senate subway station, hustling to a hearing or an important meeting in his office. If the subway wasn’t there, McCain would hit a little call button nearby to summon the car. You’d hear the ring, alerting the subway driver that the car was needed on the other end. But, more times than not, the subway didn’t come fast enough for McCain. So, he’d impatiently press the button again. And then a third time. Maybe a fourth, practically punching it.

Like an elevator, pressing the button multiple times didn’t accelerate the arrival of the subway. I often wondered if McCain was always in such a rush to make up for his years of captivity in Vietnam.

“John’s entire approach to life was we want to get the most out of the time that we have,” said former Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., on Fox. “He certainly did get the most out of the time he had here.”

The last time many saw McCain at the height of his powers came last October after four U.S. servicemen died in an ambush in Niger. And McCain was in a hurry. As Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, McCain grew frustrated that the Pentagon couldn’t provide answers about what happened.

“I want to talk to the head of Cyber,” seethed McCain, a reference to the U.S. Cyber Command.

Cyber Command could provide satellite and drone imagery about what went down. But McCain’s frustrations multiplied after he got little information. Days spilled off the calendar. McCain threatened to subpoena military officials if they didn’t offer some explanations post-haste. McCain’s ultimatum prodded Defense Secretary James Mattis to promptly pay a visit to the office of the Armed Services Committee Chairman.

McCain didn’t have time to wait around. Perhaps in more ways than one. He lost a lot of time in Vietnam. To McCain, every moment was precious. Fleeting. And he didn’t have a moment to spare.

Back in Statuary Hall, the clock on the chariot wheel ticks. The seconds melt unrelentingly into the silence. What will Clio scribble down in her book?

McCain’s death reminds us we’re all on the clock. He was running out of time.

And we are, too.",politics
"President Trump kicked off the week with a battery of tweets aimed at Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team, calling his investigators “Thugs” and accusing them of trying to tilt the midterms – ratcheting up his attacks amid speculation over White House Counsel Don McGahn’s cooperation with the probe.

The New York Times reported over the weekend that McGahn has cooperated extensively in the special counsel probe of Russian election meddling and potential collusion with Trump's 2016 campaign.

Trump has countered that he allowed McGahn and others on the White House staff to ""fully cooperate"" in a bid to show there was ""no collusion"" and ""no obstruction."" But the Times followed up with another report saying Trump’s lawyers do not know how much McGahn told investigators during months of interviews spanning 30 hours.

Trump referenced those interviews in his tweets Monday morning, accusing investigators of “looking for trouble” while maintaining that McGahn cooperated with his imprimatur.

“Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel [sic], only with my approval, for purposes of transparency. Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone … looking for trouble,” he wrote. “They are enjoying ruining people’s lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side - the lies, the firings, the deleted Emails and soooo much more! Mueller’s Angry Dems are looking to impact the election. They are a National Disgrace!”

Trump went on to tweet that Mueller’s team is focusing on obstruction of justice after finding no collusion, claiming: “If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt, they scream Obstruction!”

According to the Times, specific incidents mentioned in their McGahn conversations included moments surrounding Trump’s decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey, and his reported preference that Attorney General Jeff Sessions oversee the investigation – all relevant to a potential obstruction case.

In a tweet Sunday, Trump also contrasted McGahn with John Dean, the White House counsel for Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Dean ultimately cooperated with prosecutors and helped bring down the Nixon presidency in 1974, though he served a prison term for obstruction of justice.

""The failing (at)nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel, he must be a John Dean type `RAT,""' Trump wrote.

Dean tweeted Sunday that he doubts the president has ""ANY IDEA what McGahn has told Mueller. Also, Nixon knew I was meeting with prosecutors, b/c I told him. However, he didn't think I would tell them the truth!""

Dean later tweeted that Trump’s claims were “pure bluff” and Mueller got a “major break” with McGahn.

Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said in an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Trump didn't raise executive privilege or attorney-client privilege during those interviews because his team believed -- he says now, wrongly -- that fully participating would be the fastest way to bring the investigation to a close.

He also proclaimed Sunday that ""truth isn't truth"" while attempting to explain his reluctance to have Trump sit down for an interview with Mueller’s team.

""I am not going to be rushed into having him testify so that he gets trapped into perjury,"" Giuliani said on NBC News' ""Meet the Press."" ""And when you tell me that, you know, he should testify because he's going to tell the truth and he shouldn't worry, well that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth. Not the truth.""

""Truth is truth,"" interrupted moderator Chuck Todd, to which Giuliani responded: ""No, it isn’t truth. Truth isn’t truth.""

While the comment drew some mockery on social media, Giuliani clarified on Twitter: “My statement was not meant as a pontification on moral theology but one referring to the situation where two people make precisely contradictory statements, the classic ‘he said, she said’ puzzle. Sometimes further inquiry can reveal the truth, other times it doesn’t.”

"Nearly two dozen people -- including a child -- were killed when a raised highway in Genoa crumbled during a sudden and violent storm, sending several vehicles plunging to the ground where rescuers desperately searched for survivors.

Italy's civil protection agency Angelo Borrelli said in a news conference that 20 people were killed and 13 others were injured when a 650-foot section of the Morandi bridge collapsed over an industrial zone just after 12 p.m. local time. The bridge is part of the A10 highway that connects Italy to France.

Italian transport official Edoardo Rixi initially said 22 people were killed and eight were injured. Local reports, however, indicated the death toll could rise a rescue efforts continue.

The victims appear to all have been in vehicles when the structure crumbled beneath them, causing them to plunge nearly 300 feet to the ground, according to Borrelli. The concrete pieces also crushed two warehouses below, but officials believe no one was inside because the buildings were closed for summer holiday.

About 20 vehicles were involved, firefighter Amalia Tedeschi told RAI state TV.

The transport minister, Danilo Toninelli, earlier said the collapse was likely ""an enormous tragedy.""

""We are following minute by minute the situation of the bridge collapse in Genoa,"" Interior Minister Matteo Salvini wrote on Twitter.

Tedeschi said two people were pulled from the rubble alive as rescuers searched the scene for survivors.

The exact cause of the collapse was unclear, though a witness said he saw lightning strike the structure, which fell apart soon after.

""It was just after 11:30 a.m. when we saw the lighting bolt hit the bridge and we saw the bridge go down,"" witness Pietro M. told ANSA.



Authorities earlier said they suspected there was a structural weakness.

Images posted by state police and witnesses showed a huge section of the bridge missing and crushed trucks and cars. Parts of the structure also landed on the rooftops of nearby buildings. Video captured the sound of a man screaming: ""Oh, God, oh, God!""

Firefighters said they are concerned about gas lines in the area.

The bridge was inaugurated in 1967 and is about 0.6 miles long. It's an interchange between the northern regions of Lombardy and Piedmont and the beaches of Liguria.

The collapse also occurred on the eve of Ferragosto, a major Italian holiday. Authorities said traffic on the bridge was expected to be higher than usual because many people travel to beaches or mountains during the holiday.

Two years before the deadly collapse, an engineer said the bridge was bound for disaster. Antonio Brencich, who is also a professor at the University of Genoa, said in July 2016 that there were problems with the structure, Ingegneri.info reported.

"Colin Kaepernick returned to being front and center in the news on Monday – after a quiet hiatus. Ironically, on a holiday honoring the American labor force, Nike chose to use the unemployed former San Francisco 49ers quarterback to make a statement.

A Nike advertisement featuring Kaepernick hit social media and instantly began trending nationwide for its controversial messaging. In it, two sentences lay superimposed on a black and white headshot of Kaepernick: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” Not far away is the famous Nike slogan: “Just do it.”

If the ultimate goal was to make the National Football League one of the most politically divisive topics in America just a week before the start of the season, then sure, Nike did it all right.

Congratulations, Nike. Even the former president of Iran weighed in on the debate, tweeting his support for Nike’s latest spokesman.

In what alternate universe does a privileged athlete who amassed $39 million in a single contract qualify as having sacrificed “everything?”

To sacrifice everything, you have to be willing to part with life itself, like so many members of our military and law enforcement risk doing every single day.

This year, six American military service members have been killed in Afghanistan – one as recently as this past weekend. Since 2001, more than 2,400 American military members have been killed in Afghanistan and more than 4,500 have been killed in Iraq. These American heroes aren’t famous, and we’ll never see their faces on some glossy sports apparel poster.

My own father gave up his full-time job as a commercial airline pilot in 2002 to deploy for a tour in Iraq. My mother huddled around the living room TV glued to network news every day of that 9-month deployment. As any military family can attest to, that is the epitome of sacrifice.

Kaepernick saying he “sacrificed everything” – simply because he is currently unable to play a game and receive millions of dollars to do so – illustrates the so-called privilege that ardent national anthem protest supporters accuse others of having.

The reality is that Kaepernick, at almost 31, was destined to be nothing more than a second- or third-string quarterback, at best. With the obvious locker room distraction that Kaepernick’s social activism brings, that distraction outweighed his performance.

Furthermore, according to Denver Broncos General Manager John Elway, when Kaepernick had the opportunity to get traded to the Broncos after his benching in San Francisco in 2016, Kaepernick declined.

Why? Kaepernick wanted to make more money on his 49ers contract. That certainly is his prerogative. But claiming he sacrificed his career on a moral high ground is simply inaccurate.

Simply put, Kaepernick declined to sacrifice his bank account to play in the Mile High City.

There’s another forgotten detail in Nike propping up Kaepernick as the face of its 30th anniversary for the “Just Do It” campaign.

The Baltimore Ravens reportedly had an interest in signing Kaepernick last year. That is, until his girlfriend published a tweet containing a photo of Ray Lewis embracing team owner Steve Biscotti – in comparison to a scene from the movie ""Django Unchained,"" where a character played by Samuel L. Jackson hugs slave-owner Leonardo DiCaprio's character.

Last week, an arbitrator ruled in favor of Kaepernick in his collusion case against the NFL, which means it will go to trial. However, Kaepernick is tasked with proving 14 teams colluded against him. Good luck with that.

Even if Kaepernick wins a nearly insurmountable battle, pass the tissues to someone else. Kaepernick’s fame and income, like the $1 million book deal he inked, has only grown from this second act of martyrdom.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. believed in something and made many sacrifices over the course of his life – including giving up his life when he was assassinated – in the fight against racism and for equal rights for all Americans.

Members of the military who died defending our country – or who lost limbs when they stepped on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan or Iraq – sacrificed everything. Many of those still alive are unable to kneel in disrespect on a football field like Kaepernick – and wouldn’t want to even if they could.

Kaepernick – raking in more money with his new Nike endorsement deal or posing for a GQ “Man of the Year” photo shoot – merely sacrificed a little athletic pride for plenty of accolades.

Bottom line: Kaepernick and Nike's campaign are utterly disrespectful to our military and law enforcement officers.",world

A source familiar with the process said that because of the problems, Maricopa County may ask a court for an extension for polls to stay open past 7 p.m local time.

Earlier, Fontes said that his office, in the state's most populous county, learned of the issues Monday afternoon. Four polling places, he said, were down at 10 a.m.

""This is not a hiccup, this is a serious concern where lots of voters in Maricopa County are not able to get voting,"" Fontes said.

The contractor hired to set up voting machines in the Phoenix area apparently failed to send enough technicians, leaving several polling places out of operation. Fontes says he sent his staff to as many locations as possible to make fixes.

Fontes says the contractor didn't set up the machines on time. More than 100 calls from voters have reported problems Tuesday.

According to ABC 15 in Arizona, some voters say they were turned away from the polls because of tehnical and computer issues.

One frustrated voter, Ben Saylor, told the Associated Press he arrived at his polling place in north Phoenix and was told the equipment would not be set up until lunchtime. He was directed to a vote-anywhere polling station and also was told he would have to cast a provisional ballot.

""If you're a registered citizen, and you have the right to vote, there should be no such thing as a provisional ballot,"" Saylor said.

Among the elections taking place Tuesday is the Republican primary to replace outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake.

In the race, two-term Rep. Martha McSally has emerged as the frontrunner as she fends off challenges from the right from former state Sen. Kelli Ward and Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

In the state’s governor’s race, President Trump has endorsed the re-election effort of Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, who is facing a challenge Tuesday from former Secretary of State Ken Bennett.

“Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona is doing a great job,"" Trump said. ""It would be really nice to show your support tomorrow by voting for him in Tuesdays Primary. Doug is strong on Crime, the Border, and our Second Amendment. Loves our Military & our Vets. He has my full and complete Endorsement.”

Meanwhile, Ducey is expected to appoint someone soon to fill the seat of the late-Sen. John McCain, who died Saturday.

On the roster: Fox News Power Rankings: Candidates still count - Another key Trumpworld figure cuts deal with feds - Fox News Poll: Voters split on confirming Kavanaugh - Florida primary leaving some deep wounds - Putting the head in headshot

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: CANDIDATES STILL COUNT

With just seven primaries left in 2018 we look forward to soon being able to retire – for the time being, at least – from our work of reminding you that candidates count.

It is only too easy to look at elections as marshalled armies of data points arrayed against each other on the ballot box battlefield. Thirty-seven percent of whosits voting at a greater intensity than 41 percent of whatsits, etc.

This version lets both voters and politicians off too easily and unreasonably reduces the importance of quality candidates. The numbers of whosits and the intensity of the whatsits really does depend on who is running. This week’s changes to the Fox News Power Rankings tell that tale quite clearly.

We’re looking at the Senate this week, so first some context is in order. You can click here to see how things stand, but the short version goes like this: Democrats would need to gain two seats to take control of the Senate. There are 36 seats up for grabs this year, but for now only 11 appear to be competitive in any real sense. Of those, Democrats currently control seven and Republicans control four.

For Democrats to take the Senate they need to win nine of the 11 most hotly contested races. So you can see why even in a tough year for the GOP, Republicans remain bullish on their chances to actually expand their narrow majority.

Doing so would be a lot easier, however, if the Red Team can find a way to not give back any seats.

Republicans could take a good step in that direction on Tuesday in Arizona. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake is retiring and his departure touched off what at the outset looked to be one of the worst primary battles of 2018.

Rep. Martha McSally has the backing of the GOP establishment and has shown prodigious fundraising abilities and solid political skills in a state where maverick-y voters tend to defy conventional political definitions. Unfortunately for her, McSally drew former state lawmaker Kelli Ward as her principal primary foe.

Ward gained national attention in 2016 when she tried to unseat Sen. John McCain. She fell short after a nasty race, but demonstrated her powerful connection to the large contingent of Arizona populist nationalists of the Trump variety.

But McSally has caught a couple of breaks. First was the candidacy of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, recipient of a preemptive pardon from President Trump and a hero to immigration hardliners. Arpaio’s entry meant Ward had to cover her own right flank rather than focusing on McSally. McSally’s other good fortune was that the Trump movement and the president himself opted to stay out of the race all together.

The vote may be Tuesday, but we could have probably declared the race as good as over last week when Ward, who has trailed in every public poll taken since April, invited a notorious figure from the 2016 election – one of the principal abettors of a conspiracy theory which held that Democrats were raping children in the basement of a Washington pizza restaurant – on her bus tour.

Ugh.

For some time it appeared that McSally might go too far in kowtowing to the populist nationalists, but she has mostly kept it together, and looks poised to cruise on Tuesday. That’s bad news for Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema who has, until now, had an open lane to reinvent herself as a moderate in what is still a Republican-leaning state.

As McSally’s first general election ad shows, the free ride is over.

Because of McSally’s surprisingly clear flight path to victory, we are changing the race rating from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up.” Let the desert duel begin.

Meanwhile in Montana, we have the battle of the flat tops.

Democratic Sen. Jon Tester was a marked man after he helped scuttle Trump’s nomination of his doctor, White House physician Ronny Jackson, to lead the troubled Veterans Administration. While the president vowed to knock Tester out in retribution, Republicans still needed a vehicle for their revenge.

In June, the state GOP chose state Auditor Matt Rosendale as their man. He’s been in politics in his adopted home state since 2010, using the fortune he made in real estate back East to, with varying degrees of success, push his way into state politics.

But despite a presidential campaign visit and two months to take the fight to Tester, Rosendale appears to still be lagging. They may have the same haircut, but so far Tester seems to have succeeded in setting himself apart.

For that reason, we move the race one notch to the left from, “Toss Up” to “Lean Democrat.”



THE RULEBOOK: ROOM TO GROW

“When the dimensions of a State attain to a certain magnitude, it requires the same energy of government and the same forms of administration which are requisite in one of much greater extent.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 13

TIME OUT: ‘IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE IT, YOU GET TOUGHER’

Naval aviator John McCain was held as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam from Oct. 26, 1967 until March 14, 1973 – 1,966 days. He endured brutal beatings and abuse for much of that time because he declined to accept the pardon offered to him as the son of the admiral in command of the U.S. Pacific fleet. McCain refused to jump ahead of enlisted men and those who had been imprisoned before him. But his refusal denied the communists a public relations victory, and they spent their fury on the young pilot.

After returning home in 1973, McCain wrote a first-person account of his ordeal for U.S. News & World Report. We encourage you to read it all here. But in light of the announcement from McCain’s family that the 81-year-old senator from Arizona has discontinued medical treatment for the aggressive form of brain cancer with which he was stricken last year, we suggest some special consideration of the following passage:

“I was finding that prayer helped. It wasn’t a question of asking for superhuman strength or for God to strike the North Vietnamese dead. It was asking for moral and physical courage, for guidance and wisdom to do the right thing. I asked for comfort when I was in pain, and sometimes I received relief. I was sustained in many times of trial. When the pressure was on, you seemed to go one way or the other. Either it was easier for them to break you the next time, or it was harder. In other words, if you are going to make it, you get tougher as time goes by.”

So should every believer pray: courage, guidance and wisdom so that we too might get tougher as time goes by.

Amen.

ANOTHER KEY TRUMPWORLD FIGURE CUTS DEAL WITH FEDS

WSJ: “Allen Weisselberg, President Trump’s longtime financial gatekeeper, was granted immunity by federal prosecutors for providing information about Michael Cohen in the criminal investigation into hush-money payments for two women during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Weisselberg was called to testify before a federal grand jury in the investigation earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal previously reported, citing people familiar with the investigation. The decision by prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office to grant immunity to Mr. Weisselberg escalates the pressure on Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Weisselberg has served for decades as executive vice president and chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. After Mr. Trump was elected, he handed control of his financial assets and business interests to his two adult sons and Mr. Weisselberg.”



National Enquirer killed safe’s worth of damaging Trump stories - AP: “The National Enquirer kept a safe containing documents on hush-money payments and other damaging stories it killed as part of its cozy relationship with Donald Trump leading up to 2016 presidential election, people familiar with the arrangement told The Associated Press. The detail comes as several media outlets reported Thursday that federal prosecutors have granted immunity to National Enquirer chief David Pecker, potentially laying bare his efforts to protect his longtime friend Trump. … Several people familiar with the Enquirer’s parent, American Media Inc., who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they signed non-disclosure agreements, said the safe was a great source of power for Pecker, the company’s CEO.”



Continetti: ‘From Reality TV to Reality Politics’ - Free Beacon: “Trump went from star of reality TV to sole practitioner of reality politics. He turned Republican, national, then world politics into a riveting spectacle, a new sort of contest in which the stakes are nothing less than the fate of the United States and the protagonist must face down a staggering number of opponents to win the prize. And Trump had an advantage. He alone was familiar with the contents of the reality politics rulebook. Which meant that his antagonists, from Bob Corker to Robert Mueller, from Chuck Schumer to Elizabeth Warren, from the media to the NFL, from Ayatollah Khamenei to Xi Jinping, were on defense. … I had assumed that Trump's unusual background would limit his influence over candidate behavior. As Cohen, Omarosa, and Avenatti show, one has to be removed from statehouses and governor's mansions to practice reality politics. Recent events give me second thoughts. The emergence of these anti-Trumps suggests that there is a future for outsiders versed in tabloids, wrestling, and ‘structured reality.’”



FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SPLIT ON CONFIRMING KAVANAUGH

Fox News: “Voters are increasingly divided over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court since President Trump announced him as his choice to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. Forty-five percent would confirm Kavanaugh, while 46 percent oppose him, according to the latest Fox News poll. Last month, voters supported him by a 38-32 percent margin. Many voters at that time, 30 percent, had no opinion on Kavanaugh’s nomination. That makes sense, given interviews for the July poll were conducted July 10-11, which was soon after the president’s July 9 prime-time announcement of his selection. Since July, support for Kavanaugh is up 15 points among Republicans (was 70, now 85 percent), while opposition among Democrats is up 20 points (was 58, now 78 percent). There’s a gender gap too, as men (53 percent) are 15 points more likely than women (38 percent) to support his confirmation. Many other nominees received similar mixed support. For example, voters backed the confirmation of President Trump’s first nominee Neil Gorsuch by a 45-39 percent margin (March 2017), and former President Obama’s second nominee Elena Kagan by 38-36 percent (June 2010).”



Kavanaugh takes a step back from presidential immunity - The Hill: “Senate Democrats on Thursday pressed Judge Brett Kavanaugh on how he would view potential obstruction of justice or other possible criminal charges against President Trump if he were confirmed to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh appeared to walk back some of his earlier claims that the president should be shielded from investigations while in office, Democratic lawmakers who spoke with the Supreme Court nominee told The Hill. Trump has faced heightened legal scrutiny this week after his former longtime lawyer Michael Cohen told a judge that Trump directed him to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in hush money involving two women, in violation of campaign finance law. Senate Democrats say that Kavanaugh's handling of any case against Trump that could potentially come before the Supreme Court will take center stage when the nominee's confirmation hearings begin after Labor Day.”



Kavanaugh not involved in report on Ken Starr office leaks - WaPo: “An investigation into alleged leaks to the press from the office of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr in the 1990s makes no reference to any role played by his one-time associate, Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh. The 1999 report, made public Thursday by the National Archives, cleared Starr’s office of allegations that it improperly leaked grand jury testimony. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee had urged its release in an effort to determine whether Kavanaugh was involved in such leaks. Kavanaugh played a lead role in Starr’s investigation into the death of Clinton White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster and President Bill Clinton’s relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky. He was a go-to source for journalists and authors.”



FLORIDA PRIMARY LEAVING SOME DEEP WOUNDS

Orlando Sentinel: “With Florida voters finally about to decide party nominees on Tuesday, both Republicans and Democrats could find themselves damaged by the fighting and attacks that have marked the race for governor. … On the GOP side, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis haven’t let up on each other after weeks of bickering. Most polls suggest DeSantis, an outsider running largely on his endorsement by President Donald Trump, is leading over Putnam, a close ally of many state Republicans. … At the same time, attacks on former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham by fellow Democrats – especially Palm Beach billionaire Jeff Greene – could damage her going forward, especially if progressives backing Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum or Winter Park businessman Chris King find themselves on the losing side again when Bernie Sanders lost to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic race for president.”



It's official: Balderson wins Ohio special election - Cincinnati Enquirer: “After all votes were counted, Republican Troy Balderson won a surprisingly tight race to replace former U.S. Rep. Pat Tiberi in a closely watched central Ohio district. Balderson, with endorsements from President Donald Trump and Gov. John Kasich, eked out a win over Democrat Danny O'Connor to fill the remaining months of Tiberi's term. ‘I'm humbled by the support I've received from voters and look forward to representing Ohio's 12th Congressional district in Congress,’ Balderson said in a statement Friday. He added that O'Connor ran a ‘hard-fought race.’ In an unusual turn of events, Balderson and O'Connor will face off again on Nov. 6, fighting this time for a two-year term in Congress. Balderson's slim victory allows Republicans to maintain control of a seat that hasn't been ceded to Democrats in decades. Tiberi and Kasich both served the district for years. The race never should have been that close.”



Dem Danny O'Connor flips stance on Pelosi speakership - Free Beacon: “Danny O'Connor, a Democratic congressional candidate in Ohio, said Friday he would not support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) for speaker after previously saying that if she's the one the ‘Democratic Party puts forward,’ he would. O'Connor appeared on MSNBC's ‘Morning Joe’ to discuss his candidacy and answer questions about Pelosi, and he said Washington, D.C. needs ‘new leadership.’ MSNBC guest John Heilemann [said] … ‘My question for you is, what do you think of where the speaker currently is and whether you can envision a world in which Nancy Pelosi is not the speaker of — the potential speaker of the House and the head of your party?’ Heilemann asked. After dodging the question, MSNBC guest Susan Del Percio … repeated Heilemann's question about whether he will support Pelosi for speaker if Democrats take control of the House. ‘No, I would not,’ O'Connor said. … O'Connor's response contradicts what he said on MSNBC's ‘Hardball With Chris Matthews’ on July 24.”



Pence, Scalise raise big bucks in New Orleans - The [Louisiana] Advocate: “Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise rallied 140 Republican donors Thursday night in New Orleans by repeatedly warning about the specter of a Congress led by Nancy Pelosi, the former Democratic speaker of the House. … The fundraiser at the National World War II Museum took place at a time when many analysts believe that Democrats can win enough seats… Pence and Scalise told the well-heeled crowd that would be bad for America. … Pence and Scalise credited the tax cuts and other moves by the Trump administration with generating the country’s current strong economic growth, including what they said are record low unemployment rates among African-Americans and Hispanics.”



Trump sticks with establishment in Mississippi - WaPo: “President Trump declared his support Thursday for Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), wading into a closely watched race that has divided Republicans. In a pair of late-afternoon tweets, Trump wrote that Hyde-Smith has helped him ‘put America First!’ and has his ‘complete and total Endorsement.’ Hyde-Smith was appointed earlier this year to succeed Republican Thad Cochran, a longtime senator who stepped down amid health problems. She is running in a special election that will be held on Nov. 6, the same day as the regularly scheduled midterms. … Also in the Mississippi race is Chris McDaniel, an insurgent conservative who has been hostile to Senate GOP leaders and nearly defeated Cochran in 2014. McDaniel was encouraged to run by Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist.”

Biden makes rare endorsement in testy Delaware primary - NBC News: “Joe Biden is endorsing longtime colleague Tom Carper as he faces his toughest primary battle in decades, a rare move by the former vice president to take sides in a primary in his home state. Biden has agreed to record a robocall on behalf of Carper, who is seeking his fourth term as Delaware senator and has served in statewide office continuously since 1977. It will begin reaching state voters next week ahead of the Sept. 6 primary, NBC News has learned. … At first glance Biden's endorsement of Carper is unsurprising, given the decades-long partnership between the two. But Biden has rarely — if ever — taken sides in Democratic primaries in his state since being elected to the Senate in 1972.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“You made the comment (based, I know on polls) that something better than 80 percent of GOP voters stand solidly behind the president. I am not sure what that ‘solidly’ actually means, but put me in the 20 percent. I feel for every Republican candidate running this year, for I know that at least a few of them must be appalled at, for instance, the remarks about Jeff Sessions, yet have to be afraid ever to hint of any disagreement with the president. Just glad I voted Libertarian so that I could stick to my principles. Cowardly? Maybe, but a bad choice means there was not a good choice. When Trump has done well it has been in areas where any Republican would have done the same.” – John Johnson, Tucson, Ariz.



[Ed. note: One of the most important questions in life, but particularly in politics is always “or what?” And to a certain degree partisan approval or disapproval ratings for sitting presidents are questions relating to voters’ satisfaction with their decisions in the previous election. Many in that 80 percent may not be saying that they are pleased with Trump, per se, but that they are glad that Hillary Clinton is not president. But that will go for 2020 as well, when Clinton is not on the ballot. There’s a great deal of attention paid to these job approval numbers. We do it, as do most of our peers, and they are useful. But in American politics what really matters are choices in binary votes. Of course, many, like yourself opted not to choose the lesser of two evils and excuse yourself from the bloody fray. So far, the Democrats have been the best thing Trump has had going for him. We’ll see if that continues to be the case after 2018 and into Trump’s re-election.]



“‘Who knows what might transpire if members of Congress voted by secret ballot?’ Going out on a limb, I hazard to guess a whole lot of mischief would transpire. We have enough trouble with voice votes. But seriously—as comedians and political pundits are wont to say—why shouldn't all campaign donations be made anonymously so the politicians are not aware of their specific financiers? Making every constituent a possible, anonymous donor is a much better campaign finance reform than anything Russ Feingold and John McCain ever proposed.” – Michael Friend, Atlanta

[Ed. note: You are certainly right, Mr. Friend, but there are a few considerations to bear in mind. Are we to suppose that the individual’s collection of donations on behalf of campaigns would not find ways to signal to office holders the identities of their most generous friends? When a politician showed up at a party and saw people wearing say white boutonnieres or red armbands, he or she might know who gave what. Or, more simply, fundraisers could just tell candidates that Frank N. Stine or I. P. Freely were very, VERY enthusiastic supporters *wink* and did you know that Messrs. Stine and Freely happen to have applied for a fat government grant for their firm? Also to consider: Voters ought to know where campaigns’ support is coming from. It might be material to you to know that one faction, special interest or pressure group had fallen in with big cash for a particular candidate. There are no easy answers when it comes to campaign finance reform. Virginia’s system is pretty good. It doesn’t limit contributions but it does require instantaneous reporting, which is posted immediately online. As a rule, I tend to think that complexity is the enemy of accountability and understanding.]

PUTTING THE HEAD IN HEADSHOT

UPI: “A Missouri teen's school photos are going viral after the green shirt he wore on picture day blended in with the photographer's green screen. Laurel Hutsell said in a Facebook post that her son, Carter, wore a green shirt for his seventh grade picture day, and he came home concerned that the photographer was using green screen effects. Hutsell said she thought ‘maybe they will be OK,’ but when the sample proofs came back Carter appeared as a floating head due to the green screen backgrounds projecting onto his shirt. ‘At least his hair and smile were on point!’ Hutsell wrote. Inter State Studio, the studio behind the now-viral photos, said the proofs don't go through a human proofing process to allow for a quick turnaround time. The studio said ‘floating head’ incidents like Carter's occasionally happen, but the photos can be fixed for the final product.”

"Hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are now set to start on Sept. 4, according to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley.

Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a statement on Friday that he expects the hearings to go on for three to four days, with opening statements taking up much of Day 1.

Grassley said his team has reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages related to Kavanaugh’s time as a federal judge, calling Kavanaugh “one of the most respected jurists in the country and one of the most qualified nominees ever to be considered by the Senate for a seat on our highest court.”

“My team has already reviewed every page of the over 4,800 pages of judicial opinions Judge Kavanaugh wrote, over 6,400 pages of opinions he joined, more than 125,000 pages of records produced from his White House legal service, and over 17,000 pages in response to the most comprehensive questionnaire ever submitted to a nominee.”

KAVANAUGH DOCS FROM BUSH ADMIN HIGHLIGHT POST-9/11 LEGAL CHALLENGES

Kavanaugh was nominated on July 9 and since then, the committee has received 184,000 pages of records related to his work as a White House lawyer and for his work with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.

Democrats have argued that Republicans are rushing the process for the lifetime appointment without proper vetting. They insist the Republicans are relying on the cherry-picked files being released primarily by President George W. Bush's lawyer, Bill Burck, who is compiling and vetting the documents, rather than the traditional process conducted by the National Archives and Records Administration.

The Archives has said its review of some one million pages of Kavanaugh records the committee requested will not be available until the end of October.

The top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, said scheduling the hearing before the documents are ready ""is not only unprecedented but a new low in Republican efforts to stack the courts.""

Grassley took an opposing position on Friday, adding that at their current pace, “we have plenty of time to review the rest of emails and other records that we will receive from President Bush and the National Archives.”

Republicans are eager to confirm President Trump's nominee ahead of the new court session Oct. 1, as Justice Anthony Kennedy retires.

"The professor who reportedly assisted the FBI's Russia probe as a confidential source is at the center of a Defense Department whisteblower complaint that alleges government contractor abuses, as well as excessive payments with taxpayer dollars, according to interviews and documents reviewed by Fox News.

The complaint was filed by attorney Sean Bigley on behalf of Pentagon lawyer Adam Lovinger. Earlier this month, conservative watchdog Judicial Watch announced it was suing the Defense Department on behalf of Lovinger to force the release of emails and other electronic messages after Lovinger had his security clearance suspended.

""[The complaint] pertained to the misuse of contractors by the Department of Defense, specifically what he perceived as the use of contractors to conduct foreign relations in violation of U.S. law, as well as … gross waste and excessive expenditures that were being lavished on these contractors to do very little work,"" Bigley said.

Bigley, who is representing Lovinger pro bono, said his client flagged the concerns about contractors -- including Stefan Halper, the professor -- as early as 2016, to Lovinger's leadership at the Office of Net Assessment (ONA), which is like an internal Pentagon think tank. He said Lovinger was specifically concerned Halper was being used by the ONA to “conduct foreign relations in violation of U.S. law -- specifically he was being sent out unsupervised around the globe to meet with foreign diplomats and report back” his findings.

In May, Halper was the subject of multiple media reports linking him to the Russia probe, with The Washington Post describing the academic as ""the FBI source who assisted the Russia investigation and is at the center of a standoff between congressional Republicans and the Justice Department ... a well-connected veteran of past GOP administrations who convened senior intelligence officials for seminars at the University of Cambridge in England."" The complaint was first filed in September 2017 and was updated after the Halper reports.

An email reviewed by Fox News shows that Halper wrote to the ONA in October 2016 about a series of upcoming engagements scheduled in a foreign country. While the nation's name is redacted, the email shows Halper lined up ""14 meetings ... with various parts of the political and military community,"" and a specific appointment to consult with a brigadier whose name is also withheld.

Lovinger told his leadership that he was concerned Halper had crossed the line into diplomacy and foreign relations, and it would cause further damage to their office. ""[P]rofessor-led talks harmed [Office of Net Assessment's] reputation among segments of the [redacted] national security elite we encountered, including some very senior [redacted] officials in [redacted] government,"" Lovinger's email continued, ""[redacted] has had to spend alot of political capital to get the [redacted] government to take ONA seriously again, and we're still not out of that hold yet.""

The Code of Federal Regulations, Subpart 7.5, called ""Inherently Governmental Functions,"" states that contractors are prohibited from taking on U.S. government functions, such as the ""conduct of criminal investigations,"" the ""command of military forces,"" and ""the conduct of foreign relations.""

A review of government spending records shows that Halper was paid more than $600,000 for two contracts in 2015 and 2016 for academic papers related to Russia. In the 2015 paper titled, ""The Russia-China relationship: The Impact on the United States' Security Interests,"" Halper listed more than three dozen sources, including General V.I Trubnikov, a former head of Russian intelligence, as well as former CIA Director Michael Hayden.

A similar contract, reviewed by Fox News, awarded to a different academic for a paper on Chinese approaches to war and conflict was granted much less, about $130,000 in taxpayer funds. ""Mr. Halper was officially contracted to prepare academic studies on issues of U.S. foreign relations,"" Bigley said. ""When you compare the amount that he was paid to the work, we believe that the descrepancy was the result of the other work Mr. Halper was performing for the DoD.""

After Halper's name emerged in media reports, Lovinger's attorney said he offered to provide more documents to strengthen their formal September 2017 complaint. He told Fox News he believes his client ""unwittingly stepped into something much bigger,"" and the Halper connection explains the ""ferocity"" of the alleged retaliation against his client.

Bigley said that ""within weeks to months"" after Lovinger first raised his concerns about misuse of contractors in the fall of 2016, ""department leadership opened two internal investigations against him, and months later his security clearance was suspended without warning, his prestigious detail to the White House was canceled and ultimately his paycheck was cutoff.""

He added, ""He now sits at home figuring out how to feed his family and trying to pick up the pieces of his life.""

Lovinger ultimately admitted to ""inadvertently taking on an airplane, a single, academic-oriented report categorized as 'Classification Pending,'"" in 2016. According to the whistleblower complaint, Lovinger ""promptly admitted to the mishap,"" which was described as his only security infraction over a 12-year period at the Pentagon. The complaint stated that a review found the document had ""inadequate classification markings.""

Fox News reached out via email to Halper, who did not respond. Hayden also did not respond to a request for comment. A Pentagon spokesperson said the department would forward Fox News’ request to the responsible office.",politics
"Former CIA Director John Brennan risked damaging the intelligence community with his anti-Trump comments, retired Adm. Michael Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told ""Fox News Sunday.""

Mullen's comments came as several former intelligence officials appeared on Sunday talk shows, including Brennan -- who floated the possibility of taking legal action against the president.

""I think John's an extraordinary servant of the country, but I think he has been incredibly critical of the president, and I think that has put him in a political place which actually does more damage for the intelligence community -- which is apolitical,"" Mullen said.

Brennan had publicly accused President Trump of ""treason"" after his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin this summer in Helsinki, Finland, and he has repeatedly lambasted Trump with Twitter posts that critics have charged improperly hint at classified insider information about the ongoing Russia probe.

However, Mullen added, Trump's decision to revoke Brennan's security clearance last week raised significant concerns.

""For someone of my age, it brings back the whole concept of the 'enemies list' under President Nixon,"" Mullen continued. ""And even before that, in the early 1950s, the McCarthy era -- where the administration starts putting together lists of individuals who don't agree with them.""

The White House announced Wednesday that President Trump had revoked Brennan's security clearance, in the first decision to come from a review of access for several top Obama-era intelligence and law enforcement officials.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders read a statement on behalf of the president during the start of the press briefing, saying Brennan ""has a history that calls his credibility into question.""

Specifically, the president's statement criticized Brennan for falsely telling Congress that the CIA had not infiltrated Senate computers, and for claiming that the unverified Steele dossier was not a factor in 2016 intelligence assessments.

SPECIAL OPS HEROES SHOOT DOWN BRENNAN: 'YOU PUT YOUR POLITICS BEFORE US'

The statement also claimed Brennan had been ""leveraging"" the clearance to make ""wild outbursts"" and claims against the Trump administration in the media.

Also speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., criticized Brennan's political comments, but suggested an alternative to yanking his clearance.

""John Brennan really did cross the line. He's one of the leaders of the resistance movement. ... I understand President Trump's frustration,"" Johnson said, noting that Brennan began harshly criticizing the president as soon as he took office.

He added that former officials with security clearances aren't automatically entitled to view classified information.

""The best way of handling this, in any administration, is: If you don’t want to consult with somebody, you don’t necessarily have to yank their security clearance,"" Johnson said. ""Just don’t give them access to the classified material.""



Trump on Saturday took aim again at Brennan, calling him a “political hack” who “cannot be trusted” with national secrets.

“Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director? He will go down as easily the WORST in history & since getting out, he has become nothing less than a loudmouth, partisan, political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!” he tweeted.

For his part, Brennan declared the move to take away his clearance “part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to suppress freedom of speech & punish critics.”

LAWYERS ASK: CAN BRENNAN APPEAL TRUMP'S DECISION TO TERMINATE HIS CLEARANCE?

On Sunday, Brennan denied that he has improperly traded on his access to classified information to trash Trump, telling NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that ""I don’t believe I’m being political at all.""

Brennan also suggested he might take legal action against the president.

""If my clearances and my reputation as I’m being pulled through the mud now -- if that’s the price we’re going to pay to prevent Donald Trump from doing this against other people, to me it’s a small price to pay,"" Brennan said. ""I’m going to do whatever I can personally to try to prevent these abuses in the future, and if it means going to court, I will do that.""

Several former intelligence officers have also come to Brennan's defense, saying the president's targeted action against one vocal critic gave the appearance of petty political retribution.

One critic of Trump's decision, former CIA Director Michael Hayden, told CNN on Sunday that the relationship between Trump and the intelligence community was ""dangerously close to being permanently broken; it is badly injured right now.""

Hayden also suggested he'd be ""honored"" to lose his security clearance as well, in response to a question from host Jake Tapper.

""Well, to be included in that group? Sure,"" Hayden said. ""And frankly, if his not revoking my clearance gave the impression that I somehow moved my commentary in a direction more acceptable to the White House, I would find that very disappointing and frankly unacceptable.""

But speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, another critic of Trump's decision, acknowledged that Brennan's unfettered comments had become an ""issue.""

""John and his rhetoric have become an issue in and of itself,"" Clapper said Sunday. ""John is sort of like a freight train, and he's going to say what’s on his mind.""

The parade of ex-CIA officials on the Sunday morning shows continued on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" where former CIA Director Leon Panetta claimed Trump may not have had the legal authority to terminate Brennan's clearance unilaterally.

“I think there are questions raised as to whether or not this president has followed the executive order, and whether or not he’s provided due process to those that are going to have their security clearances revoked,” Panetta said, referring to Executive Order 12968. The order establishes procedures for revoking security clearances.

Mexican and international human rights groups on Monday told the families of 43 students missing since 2014 that they are not alone, just days after President Enrique Pena Nieto reaffirmed his belief in the government's initial widely discredited investigation into the case.

Pena Nieto released a video last week in which he conceded that he would not be leaving a peaceful and safe country when his term ends later this year. But he said he remained convinced that the students from the teachers college in the southern state of Guerrero were killed by a drug gang and incinerated in a massive fire.

His assertion came nearly four years after the Sept. 26, 2014 incident in the town of Iguala. Since then, multiple reports by international investigators have criticized and discredited parts of the government's original investigation.

Jan Jarab, representative for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Mexico, alluded to Pena Nieto's comments Monday.

""There are signs that the authorities appear to be going back to the previous version,"" Jarab said. He called it ""worrisome"" because independent experts had discredited key parts of it.

""The case of the Ayotzinapa 43 has not eclipsed the other cases of disappearances in Mexico as it could have four years ago,"" Jarab said. ""Rather it has highlighted the tragedy of disappearances that is lived in so many parts of the country and the lack of an adequate response by the state.""

Jarab called on incoming President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to use the critical outside investigations as a starting point to pick up the work of finding out what happened to the students and identifying those responsible.

In June, a federal court ordered the government to create a truth commission to reinvestigate the case. Among the problems was the widespread use of torture to extract confessions, a problem highlighted by a U.N. report earlier this year and affirmed by the court. The government is appealing the court's decision.

Jarab joined the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights monitoring team, which presented its own report to the families, and Mexico's National Human Rights Commission at the Rural Normal School at Ayotzinapa near Tixtla, Guerrero on Monday.

Their rejection of Pena Nieto's recent comments came the same day the outgoing president gave his final state of the union speech in Mexico City. Lopez Obrador will take office Dec. 1.

Luis Raul Gonzalez Perez, the head of Mexico's National Human Rights Commission, said it continues working on its own report. He said the series of human rights violations they would identify in their report would be ""exhaustive.""",world
"As the violent protests in Haiti over fuel prices continued, youth groups from multiple U.S. churches have remained in the Caribbean nation, unable to get to the airport to travel home.

The nonprofit My Life Speaks said the mission teams from Woodland Community Church in Bradenton, Fla., and the Glade Church in Mount Juliet, Tenn., have stayed in Haiti, unable to get to the airport due to protests and roadblocks.

Major protests erupted in Haiti on Friday as the government announced a sharp increase in gasoline prices. But the hike was suspended Saturday after violence broke out in the capital, Port-au-Prince, and the northern city of Cap-Haitien.

At least three people were killed in the protests, including two protesters who were fatally shot as demonstrators clashed with police, The Associated Press reported. It was unclear who shot the two men.

A security guard was also killed after he got out of a vehicle and fired a gun into the air in an attempt to disperse protesters. The Associated Press reported a group of protesters beat him to death.

Mike Wilson, the founder of My Life Speaks, told WFLA-TV that the team attempted to avoid the protests by leaving for the airport early Saturday morning. However, as the mission team continued to get stopped by roadblocks, the leaders decided it would be safer to return to their compound in Neply.

“We ask that you continue to pray for us, the Haitian people who are hurting and those innocent people caught in the middle of this moment,” My Life Speaks said on Facebook.

VIOLENT PROTESTS ERUPT IN HAITI AS FUEL PRICES SPIKE

The Tennessee nonprofit said the “team is making the most of their extra time in Haiti by spending time in the [community] and hanging out at the beach while we work to get them back to the U.S. as quickly and safely as possible.”

The compound is in a rural area away from the main roads, WFLA reported. Neply is 180 miles south of Cap-Haitien.

Jill Kramer, whose 15-year-old daughter is on the trip, told WFLA that the group did travel with armed guards when they attempted to get to the airport.

Additionally, another youth group from the Faith Community Church in Trussville, Ala., also remained stranded in Haiti Saturday, Pastor Mike Ennis told The Trussville Tribune. The 31-member team is in Haiti with the Mission of Hope nonprofit organization and is well-protected, Ennis said.

“Haiti is in a tough situation. We went to bring hope to an area that has very little hope,” the pastor said. “This validates why we went there in the first place.”

It’s unclear when the mission teams will be able to make it back to the U.S.

"The United States says its re-imposition of sanctions against Iran is a legal and justified national security measure that cannot be challenged by Tehran at the United Nations' highest court.

U.S. State Department legal advisor Jennifer Newstead on Tuesday urged judges at the International Court of Justice to reject an urgent request by Iran to order the suspension of sanctions re-imposed by President Donald Trump in May.

Iran filed a case with the court in July challenging the re-imposition. Tehran alleges that the sanctions breach a 1955 bilateral agreement known as the Treaty of Amity that regulates and promotes economic and consular ties between the two countries, which have been sworn enemies for decades.

"Usain Bolt may have just met his match — a dog from a breed known for its chubby bellies and stubby little legs.

The queen of pugs beat the competition again.

Sixty dogs competed for the title of Berlin’s fastest pug on Saturday.

Four and a half-year old frontrunner Emma, the 2016 and 2017 winner, defended her title again this year. She finished the 50-meter (roughly 54-yard) dash in 5.87 seconds, making a spokesperson of the event call her the “Usain Bolt of pugs.”

Emma’s owner Angela Kaiser told Runner’s World that the win should show dog lovers that pugs are agile.

Or at least hers is.

The other 70 competitors needed up to 40 seconds to run across the track, getting distracted on their way, or just not being in the same athletic shape as Emma.

DW reported that more than 200 pugs attended the event.

In front of a cheering crowd, Emma received a medal, trophy and pillow for her third win in a row.

"Michael Avenatti took aim at President Donald Trump and called on Democrats to “fight fire with fire” as he headlined a Democratic Party event Sunday in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House.

The Los Angeles-based attorney, best known for representing adult-film actress Stormy Daniels in her lawsuit against the president, told Fox News and other news organizations that “I’m absolutely being serious” as he mulls a run for the Democratic presidential nomination.

And his message to other potential Democratic White House hopefuls is that the 2020 “election is going to be a brutal, knockdown, street fight, and if someone’s not up for that type of campaign, they need to stay home and not seek the nomination.”

He also brushed aside any concerns that his law firm's legal issues could hurt him politically.

Headlining the Hillsborough County Democrats summer picnic and fundraiser, Avenatti repeatedly fired away at the president, saying to big applause that “Donald Trump does not have the knowledge, wisdom, compassion or fortitude to serve as president of the United States.”

But he added that “this president, no matter how corrupt or cruel he is, he knows how to fight.”

Avenatti said that Democrats “have a tendency to bring nail clippers to a gunfight” and he told the crowd of party officials, candidates and activists, “I believe that our party, the Democratic Party, must be a party that fights fire with fire. I believe we cannot be the party of turning the other cheek.”

And as he did during a stop last weekend in Iowa – the state that holds the first-in-the-nation caucus – Avenatti modified a slogan made famous by former first lady Michelle Obama, urging that “when they (Republicans) go low, we hit harder.”

He closed his nearly 25-minute speech with a variation of Trump’s signature campaign line, saying, “We will make America gracious again. We will make America fair again. We will make America dynamic again. We will make America respected. And above all else, we will make America America again.”

Avenatti arrived in New Hampshire from Florida, where he headlined a Democratic Party event in Tampa Saturday night. He told reporters he’s headed back to Iowa in a few days and announced he’d return to New Hampshire in late September.

I don’t think [President Trump is] very quick on his feet. I don’t think he’s that intelligent and I think he’d be completely outclassed. - Michael Avenatti

Pushing back against charges that his political testing of the waters is a publicity stunt, Avenatti argued, “I’m not going to go out and do this and give speeches like this and talk to people on some lark. I’m going to seriously consider this because the 2020 election is a critical election, I would venture to say the most critical in modern times.”

Avenatti warned, “If the Democratic Party proceeds to nominate the person who would be the best president, that is going to be a mistake.”

He said 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton “was the most qualified individual to ever run for the White House in the history of our nation.”

LIZ PEEK: IS AVENATTI READY TO RUN? HIS LEFT-WING MEDIA ALLIES CERTAINLY THINK SO!

But he added that “all the experience in the world, all the qualifications in the world, all of the policy positions in the world, they don’t mean anything if you can’t beat Donald Trump in the general election, period.”

Asked how he would take the fight to the president, a confident Avenatti claimed, “Donald Trump doesn’t want to debate me on a national stage. That’s for sure. There’s no question about that.”

“I think he’s a bully and I think he doesn’t like people who punch back and I think I’d be incredibly effective against him,” Avenatti added. “I don’t think he’s very quick on his feet. I don’t think he’s that intelligent and I think he’d be completely outclassed.”

AVENATTI: 'I'M EXPLORING A RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES'

Avenatti’s firm Eagan Avenatti was settling a case with the Internal Revenue Service over $880,000 in unpaid payroll taxes. The firm had defaulted on millions of dollars in debt and had fallen years behind in paying its payroll taxes.

Asked by Fox News if he was concerned his firm’s legal issues could affect his hopes of running for the White House, Avenatti said, “I’m not worried about it. Show me anybody who’s had great success and I’ll show you somebody that’s had great challenges.”

On policy, Avenatti told the crowd that as president, he’d push for Medicare for all, ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment, and what he called “sensible gun control in America,” adding, “We should never have another school shooting on U.S. soil.”

He also called for investing in public school teachers and securing the nation’s borders “while at the same time honoring the values and principles that founded this country.”",politics
"A lengthy list of questions for President Trump from special counsel Robert Mueller was leaked to The New York Times, marking the latest in a string of apparently deliberate disclosures relating to the ongoing probe into Russian involvement in the U.S. presidential election.

Fox News has since obtained the questions, which cover Trump's interactions with key figures like former FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn.

The Times called some of the questions ""tantalizing"" and suggested they reveal that Mueller may have uncovered pre-election outreach by Trump's campaign to Russian officials.

The questions cover Trump's motivations for firing Comey a year ago, as well as his reaction to Sessions' recusal from the Russia investigation.

Trump blasted the leak on Tuesday morning, calling it ""disgraceful"" that the questions made it out to the media.

""So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were “leaked” to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!"" Trump tweeted.

In one question first obtained by the Times, Mueller asks what Trump knew about campaign staff, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, reaching out to Moscow.

Leaks in the Mueller probe have been suspected for several months, leading The New York Post to ask last year if Mueller is ""playing politics with his prosecutions.""

WATCH: IS THE MUELLER TEAM LEAKING TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE?

The news of the indictments of Paul Manafort and Flynn, for example, came in media reports days in advance. Although some commentators have praised Mueller for clamping down on leaks, Republicans have sharply criticized past disclosures they suggest came from within Mueller's ranks.

Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, the leader of the House’s top investigative committee, slammed Mueller in October for allowing the news media to learn that he and his legal team had charges in their Russia investigation.

“In the only conversation I’ve had with Robert Mueller, I stressed to him the importance of cutting out the leaks,” Gowdy, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, told “Fox News Sunday.” “It’s kind of ironic that the people charged with investigating the law and the violations of the law would violate the law.”



Although Mueller's team has indicated to Trump's lawyers that he's not considered a target, investigators remain interested in whether the president's actions constitute obstruction of justice and want to interview him about several episodes in office. The lawyers want to resolve the investigation as quickly as possible, but there's no agreement on how to do that.

“It’s kind of ironic that the people charged with investigating the law and the violations of the law would violate the law.” - Rep. Trey Gowdy

Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow declined to comment to The Associated Press on Monday night, as did White House lawyer Ty Cobb.

OPINION: WHY TRUMP HAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO FIRE MUELLER

Mueller has brought several charges against Manafort, but none are for any crimes related to Russian election interference during the 2016 campaign. And he has denied having anything to do with such an effort.

The queries also touch on Trump's businesses and his discussions with his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, about a possible Moscow real estate deal. Cohen's business dealings are part of a separate FBI investigation.

One question asks what discussions Trump may have had regarding ""any meeting with Mr. Putin,"" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Another question asks what the president may have known about a possible attempt by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to set up a back channel with Russia before Trump's inauguration.

Additional questions center on Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his discussions on sanctions against Russia with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition. Flynn is now cooperating with Mueller's investigators.

PELOSI CLAIMS MUELLER WAS FIRED IN BIZARRE EMAIL TO DONORS

""What did you know about phone calls that Mr. Flynn made with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, in late December 2016?"" reads one question. Another asks if there were any efforts to reach out to Flynn ""about seeking immunity or possible pardon.""

Flynn was fired Feb. 13, 2017, after White House officials said he had misled them about his Russian contacts during the transition period by saying that he had not discussed sanctions.

The following day, according to memos written by Comey, Trump cleared the Oval Office of other officials and encouraged Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn.

"President Trump's historic – and controversial – decision to relocate America's Israel embassy to Jerusalem is attracting more followers on the world stage, as several other nations open their own outposts in the holy city or consider doing so.

Slovakia last week became the latest Eastern European country to flirt with the idea of moving its embassy, when lawmakers announced the country would open a cultural center in Jerusalem.

The tentative step speaks to the flickers of international support that have emerged for Trump's decision, despite the United Nations' overwhelming condemnation of the related move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales was among the first to outright endorse the decision. Just two days after the U.S. opened its embassy doors in Jerusalem, he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shook hands as the Central American country opened its own embassy in an office complex in West Jerusalem.

Trump’s decision last December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital – and approve the embassy move from Tel Aviv – reversed a decades-old U.S. policy and stirred anger among many in the Arab world and America's Western allies. Netanyahu, however, praised the U.S. and later praised Guatemala’s decision, saying that the two countries “share friendship, courage and loyalty.”

“It’s not a coincidence that Guatemala is opening its embassy in Jerusalem right among the first,” Netanyahu said in reference to Israel’s founding in 1948, according to the Washington Post. “You were always among the first. You were the second country to recognize Israel.”

Less than a week after Guatemala’s embassy opening, Netanyahu was once again shaking hands with a Latin American leader. This time it was Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes at the inauguration ceremony for the South American nation’s embassy in Jerusalem.

The opening of the Guatemalan and Paraguayan embassies came on the heels of a decision in April by lawmakers in Honduras to move its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, though the measure is non-binding and currently no official move from Tel Aviv has taken place.

Experts say that part of the reason these Latin American nations are recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and relocating their embassies there has to do, in part, with the rise of evangelical Christianity in the region. But the embassy moves are also seen as political maneuvering to curry favor with the U.S in the hopes of preserving foreign aid and easing some pressure on them in regards to the current migration crisis.

“This is a low cost way to ingratiate themselves to the U.S.,” said Eric Olson, the deputy director of the Latin American program at the Wilson Center. “They’re using it as an opportunity to make the case for more aid to deal with migration issues. It’s playing good defense with the U.S.”

The status of Jerusalem is arguably the touchiest issue when it comes to forging a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who want control of East Jerusalem, which was captured by the Israelis in the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel, however, regards the entirety of Jerusalem as the country’s capital.

The opening of the U.S. embassy was met with clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops in which dozens of Palestinians were killed or wounded.

Besides fueling a long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the status of Jerusalem has divided world powers. The United States' about-face under Trump was met with widespread condemnation from many allies, including the European Union, which believes the final status of Jerusalem should be decided in peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.

Despite the grumbling from leaders in Brussels over Trump’s embassy relocation, not all European nations fell in line with the policy after the U.S. moved its embassy. While the EU officially boycotted the ceremony to celebrate the new U.S. embassy, four of its member nations – Austria, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic – accepted Israel’s invitation to attend and, in the proceeding months, some European countries have made headway in moving their own embassies to Jerusalem.

In late May, the Czech Republic reopened its honorary consulate in Jerusalem after President Milos Zeman voiced his wish to move the Czech embassy to the city from Tel Aviv. Zeman is known for his pro-Israel stance, but the Czech Foreign Ministry said to Israeli media that the decision to reopen the honorary consulate had “no influence on the final agreement on Jerusalem,” and added that Prague “fully respects the common position of the European Union that considers Jerusalem as the future capital of both states, that is to say, the State of Israel and the future state of Palestine.”

After a phone call with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov in June, Netanyahu announced that Bulgaria was following in the Czech Republic’s footsteps by opening its own honorary consulate in Jerusalem, while keeping its embassy in Tel Aviv.

And in Romania, a major political rift has opened over a proposal to move the country’s embassy, with President Klaus Iohannis calling on Prime Minister Viorica Dancila to resign after she endorsed a secret deal to move the country's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. In Romania, any decision on embassy relocation rests with the president, who said he was not consulted about that or the state visit Dancila paid to Israel in the spring.

""A secret document, a secret foreign policy memorandum, was discussed last week in the government. That was a big mistake,"" Iohannis said, according to the CBC. ""Because in foreign policy matters, if we are talking about secret documents, which obviously are sensitive otherwise they should not be secrets, the president should have been consulted, which did not happen.""",politics
"President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are in Singapore where they will meet one-on-one for a historic summit Tuesday.

After some back-and-forth on whether the meeting would actually happen, the two leaders arrived in Singapore on Sunday. They are scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. local time (9 p.m. ET Monday) with only translators present, according to the White House.

The meeting will later expand to include other officials, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, chief of staff John Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton.

The summit will be the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader.

“It’s important because of the potential opening it has; there is potential diplomatic progress,” former Vice Adm. Robert B. Murrett, a professor of practice, public administration and international affairs at Syracuse University, told Fox News.

“This is something we haven’t been able to do for many years,” said Murrett, who also serves as deputy director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at the college, specializes in national security, international relations, military and defense strategy.

Why is this meeting significant?

Aside from the potential diplomatic benefits between the U.S. and North Korea, the summit could benefit other countries.

“It not just about the United States,” he said, explaining that the meeting could have also been a win for “our partners in the east, such as South Korea and Japan, but also areas in the South Pacific region such as Australia.”

He added, ""These talks have the ability to reduce security tensions in East Asia and present an opportunity for the U.S. to reinforce the strong links with South Korea, Japan and even China.""

TRUMP CANCELING NORTH KOREA SUMMIT DECRIED BY SOME LAWMAKERS, PRAISED AS 'RIGHT CALL' BY OTHERS

What topics are Kim and Trump expected to discuss?

Denuclearization will be at the fore, Murrett said.

North Korea’s “nuclear weapons and ability to deliver them at long distances should be central,” said Murrett, who added that recent talks between North and South Korea “would suggest that it would remain a core issue.”

But Murrett also expected discussion of the Hermit Kingdom's role in the global economy.

Despite various sanctions placed on the country, North Korea’s economy grew by 3.9 percent in 2016. But Murrett said diplomatic talks represent the “prospect of North Korea rejoining the family of the Asians” if only from an economic standpoint, potentially opening the door for the country to trade with more than just China.

“It would be in the interest of the people of North Korea,” Murrett added.

Does Trump deserve credit for the summit?

In short: Yes, in part.

While Trump deserves credit for agreeing to meet with Kim, his decision to do so was likely sparked by “the window of opportunity that has existed because of ongoing pressure” on North Korea to better its relations with surrounding countries and beyond, Murrett said.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in also deserves a “fair amount of credit,” he said, citing the recent summit between the two Koreas and the display of unity at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang as one of “several steps toward unification in some fashion or another.”

“Trump is one of many important players,” said Murrett, noting that Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe were also key players.

Abe met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in April, where the two “affirmed their strong determination to strengthen our shared resolve on North Korea, and increase the capability of the U.S.-Japan Alliance to confront all emerging threats to peace, stability, and an international order based on the rule of law,” the White House said at the time.

And President Xi and Kim secretly met in May in China, Chinese state television announced after the North Korean leader had already left the country.

""[The leaders] had an all-around and in-depth exchange of views on China-[North Korea] relations and major issues of common concern,"" the Chinese news agency reported, while Kim was quoted saying that he hopes to “build mutual trust with the U.S. through dialogue.”

"For the last two decades, debates over immigration reform have largely focused on illegal immigration. In recent weeks, however, the debate has increasingly turned to proposals dealing with legal immigration and the way we award green cards, which allow immigrants to live and work permanently in the U.S.

At last week’s State of the Union address, President Trump outlined four “pillars” of his proposed immigration framework. The first two pillars deal with illegal immigration. The first calls for a pathway to citizenship for individuals brought illegally to the United States as children. The second calls for increased border security.

The framework’s third and fourth pillars are less familiar. They address legal immigration. The third pillar calls for ending the visa lottery, through which 50,000 individuals each year from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States receive green cards. The fourth pillar calls for revising current family-based immigration laws to reduce the number of green cards awarded on the basis of family connections.

Predictably, President’s Trump’s plan was met with howls of outrage on the left. Critics charged the president with showing animosity, not just toward illegal immigration, but toward legal immigration as well.

The notion that our legal immigration laws merit rethinking, however, is not anti-immigrant. Rather, it’s a question of allocation.

Through the visa lottery, we award 50,000 green cards each year based on country of origin. Through our current family-based immigration laws, we award hundreds of thousands of additional green cards on the basis of family connections. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents can sponsor parents, children, siblings, and others for green cards.

No one disputes that family relationships are extremely important. As the father of six children, I know as well as anyone the importance of family.

But that doesn’t mean family connections, or country of origin, should take priority over other considerations, like education or skill level, in awarding limited numbers of green cards.

Each year, far more people apply to enter our country than there are available green cards. This means we must choose who gets priority and who doesn’t.

And in our increasingly competitive, globalized economy, it’s entirely reasonable to ask whether an immigration system that focuses more on education and skills than on country of origin and family connections might better advance America’s interests.

Today American companies compete not just with each other, but with companies across the globe. Businesses need the best available talent to succeed, and America needs the world’s best and brightest to keep itself at the forefront of innovation.

That’s why I recently reintroduced my Immigration Innovation Act, or I-Squared, to ensure that employers are able to hire – and retain – workers with the skills they need. I-Squared does this by increasing the number of available high-skilled visas and by streamlining the process by which a skilled worker can transition to green card status.

I-Squared also simplifies the process by which students who come to the United States for college or graduate school can obtain permanent employment following graduation. Few things make less sense than welcoming bright, hard-working individuals to our country to be educated and then sending them back home to compete against us.

As we consider proposals to reform legal immigration, our focus needs to be on how we can design a system that better meets the needs of 21st century America. And high-skilled immigration must be at the center of that discussion.

We don’t need to reinvent the wheel here. We already have high-skilled immigration programs in our existing laws. Visa categories like EB1, EB2 and EB3, as well as H-1B, are designed for immigrants with in-demand skills.

In my view, an eminently reasonable resolution to the current debates about the visa lottery and family-based immigration would be to reallocate green cards currently set aside for the lottery and for parents, siblings, and adult children to high-skilled visa categories.

At the same time, we should take the opportunity to fix any flaws in these categories’ current structure. This commonsense approach would help ensure that we have a modern workforce with the skills employers need, while avoiding rabbit-hole discussions about overall levels of immigration that are likely to take us nowhere.

Let me be clear. I’m not calling for any reduction in legal immigration. Legal immigration always has been, and always will be, essential to our country’s success and economic prosperity. Moreover, there is no way that any immigration proposal that contains cuts to legal immigration will attain sufficient congressional support to become law.

What I am calling for is a smarter, better calibrated legal immigration system that gives greater priority to education and skill level, just like my I-Squared bill does.

Now that the moment has come to talk about legal immigration, let’s be smart. Let’s talk about high-skilled immigration and how we can design a legal immigration system that will prepare our country for success for decades to come.",politics
"Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton announced Monday she is a ""definite maybe"" to run for political office in the future, saying she is ""outraged every day by something our president has done or said or left undone or neglected.""

Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, Clinton outlined a host of grievances against the Trump administration, but emphasized she has no current plans to run for office.

""At the federal level, as much as I abhor so much of what President Trumpis doing, I have a great amount of gratitude for what my congresswoman and my senators are doing to try to stop him at every point,” Clinton told attendees.

""I think I’m just so fundamentally my mother’s daughter that I’m far more outraged by the Trump administration ripping children away from their families at the border and not having reunified those children with their families now for months, than I am about anything he has ever done to my families,” she added.

TRUMP ADMIN SAYS ALL ELIGIBLE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES

Last month, the Trump administration annonuced that all eligible small children who were separated from their families under the White House's new “zero-tolerance” immigration policy had been reunited with their loved ones.

However, hundreds of children under the age of five remained in government custody due to safety concerns, the deportation of their family members or another reason, according to the Department of Homeland Security. A federal judge has criticized the administration's efforts to reunite families separated at the border.

“For me it’s a definite 'no' now, but it’s a definite 'maybe' in the future because who knows what the future is going to bring."" - Chelsea Clinton

“I think my family ... is being really well represented,"" Clinton said. ""But if that were to change, if my city councillor were to retire, if my congresswoman were to retire, my senators, and I thought that I could make a positive impact, then I think I would really have to ask my answer to that question.""



She clarified: “For me it’s a definite 'no' now, but it’s a definite 'maybe' in the future because who knows what the future is going to bring.""

Earlier this year, Clinton said criticism against Ivanka Trump, President Trump's daughter, is fair game and should be expected because she works for the president. Clinton last year had engaged in something of a Twiter spat with Trump, after media reports criticized Ivanka for sitting in during a meeting at the G20 summit in Germany.

“If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother, as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

Clinton shot back: ""Good morning Mr. President. It would never have occurred to my mother or my father to ask me. Were you giving our country away? Hoping not.""

Clinton also had some words of praise for her mother on Monday, whose upset defeat in the 2016 presidential election stunned observers.



Earlier this year, Chelsea denied a New York Times report that she had prematurely popped champagne and poured it into staffers' glasses on election night.

""She just has continued to persist forward in trying to have a positive impact in politics and outside politics in the way that I have seen her do my entire life,"" Clinton said.

Clinton's comments about a potential run for office Monday were a marked change of tune. Last year, in a video interview with Variety magazine, she said, ""Hi, I'm Chelsea Clinton, and one thing you may not know about me is I am not running for public office. I mean, I just -- no.""

Chelsea's about-face on her interest in running for federal office has some precedent in her family. Hillary Clinton had previously ruled out a 2016 presidential bid several times, even telling NBC anchor Ann Curry ""no"" three times in 2009 when asked whether she would ever run for president again.

The younger Clinton may face some oddball competition. Michael Avenatti, the lawyer representing adult film star Stormy Daniels who has openly feuded with President Trump and his attorneys, announced in an interview earlier this month that he, too, is looking into a run for office -- and, he says, he hopes people take him ""seriously.""

"More than 100,000 mostly ethnic Karen refugees from Burma - many Christians among them - are crammed into nine camps set out in isolated, misty hills of jungle terrain inside the border of Thailand.

The camps, which have been here for generations, are now rife with depression, substance abuse, and suicide - a taboo topic in Karen culture. Loved ones often refuse to discuss suicides, out of fear it will afflict another family member.

Yet the hushed-away problem figures only to worsen as camp conditions deteriorate, and donations from an international community that hears much more these days about persecuted Muslims in another Burmese minority group, the Rohingya, begin to dry up.

“There is an increased pressure on people as a result of the reductions (in aid),” said Hayso Thako, an education coordinator for the camps. “For the older people, they have been here so long they have lost hope of a better life. And for the young people who take their lives, there is no hope that they can see.”

Three years after their joint suicide, the legacy of two such youth still haunts the Karen.

In March, 2015, Kyawsay and his girlfriend, Nawehkohloh, were teenagers in love. Members of the long-persecuted Burmese Karen minority, they were both born in the Mae La Oon refugee camp along the Burma-Thailand border. They knew nothing – and had never seen so much as a glimpse – of the world outside.

Ensnared by family conflicts, a lack of opportunity and an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, the young lovers hung themselves side-by-side in a school classroom inside the camp grounds one afternoon.

The tragic double-suicide rocked the refugee community. But it would not be first – nor the last – incidence of a refugee taking their life in what has become a growing problem.

According to official data provided to Fox News, since 2015 some 60 refugees between the ages of 12 and 72 have committed suicide. Another 23 have attempted it.

It's not hard to understand why.

Established nearly 35 years ago, a faded “temporary” sign still adorns the entrance of the Mae La camp, the largest of the nine camps, and “home” to almost 40,000 Karen. Thousands of children were born and raised in the camps, then went on to have children of their own.

That's produced multiple generations who have not been allowed to set foot beyond the barbed-wire barricades, as per Thai government regulations.

Visitors are also typically not permitted to enter the deeply secluded grounds. The refugees are considered stateless, and without a country to call their own, are generally forbidden from gaining Thai citizenship. They are also unable or unwilling to register as Burmese citizens, or obtain documentation from abroad.

That leaves the refugees with few options, though some do their best to pass the time.

Despite losing limbs and their eyesight to landmines, a group of Christian men being cared for in a small cement shelter have learned to weave and bead – making delicate hearts and crosses, keychains and jewels, which they sell for a few pennies to passers-by.“

Jesus is our hope, our life,” the men sing in their native tongue, having formed their own gospel choir to pass the dark days and nights.

The camps frequently experience devastating flash floods in the wet season, which have claimed the lives of dozens of refugees - and obliterated fragile homes built with bamboo and banana leaves.

Worse, in recent years Karen refugees have seen their already limited monthly rations of rice, yellow split peas, fortified flour and fish paste fall by almost half. That figure is expected to drop even further in the coming months – worsening the already acute rate of malnutrition in the camp, according to the Mae La camp's top official, who goes only by the first name of Honest.

He lamented that the drop in donor funding has have also meant Karens working in the camp – including teachers – have been reduced to taking a skeletal salary, with even that expected to dissipate come November. By next year, the higher education programs will have been cut from the budget too.

“Most have no opportunity to even make a small income for their family, they aren’t allowed to go outside to work,” continued Honest. “The international community likely thinks the situation in Burma is changing, that it is becoming peaceful and the Karen people can go home. But we cannot. There is still a lot of armed conflict, it is not safe. And even if the Burmese government says they are negotiating for our return, it is the Army in charge. At any time, the violence can start all over again.”

YEMEN'S CHILD SOLDIERS FACE LONG ROAD AFTER SEXUAL, PHYSICAL ABUSE

International donors have steadily bowed out in recent years, following Burmese government claims that it has achieved peace with the Karen. The aid money and attention was siphoned off by other international crises and, more recently, to the plight of the mostly Muslim Rohingya.

But despite the signing of a peace agreement in 2015 between the government and armed Karen groups, critics contend the apparent accord is superficial, and tensions below the surface are still boiling.

For many, the notion of going home is fraught with even more fear and pain.

Mary, a 44-year-old widowed mother of two boys – aged seven and 11 – fled the intense fighting in Burma after the Army set fire to her village just over 11 years ago. Her mother died along the road to the Thai border, and since that day Mary has shut off all memory of life before being rendered a refugee.

ACTIVISTS MARK 30 YEARS AFTER BURMA UPRISING

“I’m afraid to go back. I cannot go back,” she explained. “We lost everything – there is no work, no land for us anymore. I do not remember anything from there anymore. I had to lose everything when I left.”

In addition to property, food, job and security concerns should they return to Burma, Karen refugees are also concerned about the inherent threat of landmines, unexploded ordnance and other remnants of war.

An International Rescue Committee (IRC)’s hospital – the only one on the expansive grounds – is filled to overflowing with patients. There is a shortage of trained medical staff, which is grapplles with outbreaks of dengue fever – spread by mosquito bites - which has already affected more than 100 children.

With immediate medical needs a top priority, the notion of adequate psychological assistance is a far away pipe dream.

Rev. Robert Htwa, one of the original camp founders and missionaries tending to the Karen, said some camps offer basic rehabilitation and counseling. But he stressed the funding cuts have meant only a small portion of those in need are able to receive even the most rudimentary help.

Depression, which is said to afflict around half the adults in the camp system, has brought with it drug addiction, and higher numbers of children are at risk of malnutrition and neglect.

Pregnant and post-partum women, too, are said to be among the highest portion of the refugee population suffering from depression and mental illness.

For now, life lingers in a forsaken limbo and the sense of sorrow is palpable.

“We don’t know what will happen,” Rev. Htwa added. “There is nowhere to go.”",world

Iraq's newly-elected parliament held its first session on Monday as two blocs, both claiming to hold the most seats, vied for the right to form a new government.

The session opened with a prayer and an orchestral performance of the national anthem, as lawmakers sat for the first time since national elections were held in May.

The new parliament faces the twin tasks of rebuilding the north of the country following the war against the Islamic State group, while rehabilitating services to the south, where severe water and electricity shortages have fueled protests.

""We must focus in the next stage on reconstruction, services, and providing jobs. It is the time for economic reforms and expanding our security achievements,"" said caretaker Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in an address to parliament.

Al-Abadi, who came to power in 2014, oversaw the war on the IS group after the extremists swept through the north of the country.

He declared victory last year, but the militants continue to raid, kidnap, and murder Iraqis in lawless and underserved regions in the west and center of the country.

Lawmakers must now select a parliament speaker before electing a president. The president then appoints a prime minister to form a government.

Two factions claim to hold the most seats in parliament and therefore the right to name a prime minister.

A coalition led by al-Abadi and populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has the support of the U.S., while an alliance between former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and militia leader Hadi al-Amiri is backed by Iran.

But it is not clear if either alliance has an outright majority, and al-Maliki is said to be trying to woo lawmakers from al-Abadi's bloc to switch sides. Al-Maliki and al-Abadi are both leading members of the Islamic Dawa party, which remains divided over the longstanding rivalry between the two men.",world
"From siccing wild dogs on his own uncle to gunning down his enemies with artillery meant for taking out planes, North Korea's Kim Jong Un has built a reputation for dispatching with extreme prejudice all those who cross him.

While some of the terrifying methods of execution have never been confirmed, the mere mention of them is sure to keep his inner circle in line - and any potential rivals quiet, say experts. A confirmed favorite tactic, blowing people away with anti-aircraft guns, leave victims unrecognizable.

""Because there are several guns bound together, it would be hard to find the body after firing it once."" - Hong Hyun-ik, Sejong Institute

""Because there are several guns bound together, it would be hard to find the body after firing it once,"" Hong Hyun-ik, chief researcher at the Sejong Institute, a security think tank based in Seoul, told local broadcaster YTN in 2015. ""It's really gruesome.""

In late February, South Korean officials revealed that five North Korean officials had been subjected to the particularly grisly form of overkill. Other methods trickle out of the secretive Hermit Kingdom, their unverified status only burnishing the legend of Kim's depravity.

A report that one official was killed by a mortar round has been treated with skepticism. But the tale sent a strong message when coupled with his alleged crime: drinking and carousing during the official mourning period following the death of Kim's father, the equally brutal Kim Jong Il.

Kim's reach extends beyond the pariah nation he never leaves, as demonstrated by the almost certainly sanctioned hit on his half-brother earlier this year. Kim Jong Nam, seen as a successor to Kim should a coup take place, was sprayed in the face with VX nerve agent by two women as he prepared to catch a flight from Kuala Lampur to Macau. North Korea has denied reports that Kim ordered his paternal half-brother's murder.

Perhaps the most frightening method of execution ordered by the 33-year-old, third-generation dictator is allowing a pack of starving dogs to devour enemies. In one notable case, the victim was purportedly Kim's own uncle.

Jang Song-thaek was thought of as a father figure to Kim Jong Un, and served as the second-in-command to the supreme leader. But when he ran afoul of Kim in 2013 for ""anti-state acts"" and ""double-dealing,"" his familial ties couldn't save him from his nephew's wrath.

Related Image Expand / Collapse

How Jang died may never come to light, but a rumor that he was fed to dogs was widely reported. Other reports subsequently claimed that Jang was likely executed by anti-aircraft guns before his body was incinerated by flamethrowers.

The gout-addled Kim also had several of his uncle's cronies killed, and was reportedly ""very drunk"" when he gave the orders.

According to a report from the Institute for National Security Strategy, a South Korean think tank, Kim has ordered the execution of more than 340 individuals since taking power in 2011. The report also indicates that the number of military and government officials purged by Kim since 2011 has increased every year. Just 3 officials were executed in 2012, compared to about 140 since the beginning of 2016.

Michael Malice, author of ""Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim Jong Il,"" said Kim's real favored means of murder is simply presiding over what Malice calls ""the worst country on earth.""

""[Kim] chose to let a million to two million people starve to death in the 90’s. So 340 executions,"" Malice said. ""That number is better to focus on than the guy who probably wasn't eaten by dogs.""

But when Kim turns executioner, he maximizes the deterrent effect, Malice said.

""If you want to talk about weird methods of killing, the fact that everyone has to watch is horrifically weird,"" the author told Fox News.

Malice was referring to reports from defectors that North Koreans are forced to watch the many public executions that occur. The claim - and Kim's underlying purpose - were echoed by a 2014 report from the United Nations Human Rights Council.

""Public executions and enforced disappearance to political prison camps serve as the ultimate means to terrorize the population into submission,"" the report stated.

Americans consider Otto Warmbier, the 22-year-old college student sentenced to 15 years' hard labor for stealing a poster, to have effectively been a victim of Kim's bloodlust. It may never be known what killed Warmbier, but he was returned to the U.S. last week, 17 months after beginning his sentence, in a terminal state. He was buried Thursday.

Even if Warmbier's death was not technically an execution, it is a stark reminder of how even minor crimes are dealt with in North Korea. People are publicly executed for such ""crimes"" as importing South Korean or American music and movies or being caught with a Bible.

""To focus on this carnival aspect [of Kim's allegedly unusual executions] really misses the point about what makes this place so unique and horrible,"" Malice said. ""This is what they have to worry about on a regular basis.""",world
"A scheduled stop on Sean Spicer’s book tour at a Massachusetts BJ’s Wholesale Club has been canceled over apparent concerns about the “political climate.”

“We got word last Friday the store was cancelling ‘due to the political climate,’’’ a spokesperson for Regnery Publishing told Fox News. “Of course, we were very disappointed, but also surprised since we have had such a terrific response to all of the other events we have scheduled around the country.”

Saturday’s book signing at the BJ’s in Seekonk was to be one of more than two dozen promotional events for the former White House press secretary’s book, “The Briefing,” between now and the end of September.

There has been some confusion about the possibility of re-booting the event, but as of Tuesday afternoon it is still off the books.

“After two different reporters called the store today to find out why the event had been canceled, we received a note from corporate saying they wanted to proceed as originally planned,” the Regnery spokesperson said. “However there seems to be some confusion because the store is still telling people who call that the event has been canceled.”

An employee answering the phone at the Seekonk, Mass., store on Tuesday afternoon told Fox News the event had been canceled, and said an explanation would have to come from the corporate office.

Multiple officials have not returned emails and telephone calls from Fox News requesting further details.

This particular BJ’s has hosted book signings for stars of reality television programs including “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” and “Cake Boss,” but it’s unclear if it’s ever been the venue for a political guest.

"James Comey fired back this week at Hillary Clinton after the former secretary of state cited the Justice Department inspector general report on her email case to challenge the premise of the investigation itself.

Clinton did so in a terse, snarky tweet following the release of the nearly 600-page report, which accused the former FBI director of defying the chain of command during the email probe. It also said he, too, used a personal email account for some government business.

“But my emails,” Clinton tweeted, in response to a reporter tweet about Comey’s use of a “gmail” account -- a slap at the outrage over her private email server and the FBI probe itself.

But during an interview in Berlin this week, Comey was asked whether he would apologize to Clinton -- and refused. He stressed the difference between his personal email use, which involved unclassified information, and hers and said she still doesn't understand why she was investigated.

COMEY USED PERSONAL EMAIL TO CONDUCT FBI BUSINESS, WATCHDOG REPORT FINDS

“No. And here’s why. I don’t want to criticize her, but it shows me that even at this late date, she doesn’t understand what the investigation in her case was about,” Comey said during an interview with German newspaper Die Zeit.

“It was not about her use of a personal email system, and she didn’t get that during the investigation, because she used to say ‘Colin Powell when he was secretary of state used AOL,’ that was not what it was about,” Comey explained. “It was about communicating about classified topics on that system when those topics have to be done on a classified system.”

He added: “Which she never did. It would have been a problem if she was using AOL, or gmail, or Clinton.com—or the State Department’s [unclassified] system.”

DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that Comey used a personal email account to “conduct unclassified FBI business,” which he found was “inconsistent with Department policy.” Horowitz cited what he called “the absence of exigent circumstances the frequency with which the use of personal email occurred.”

Comey defended his use of a personal email account—but said he understood why Horowitz put it in the report.

“What I would do, is when I had to write speeches—I would write my own speeches—I would type them at home and then gmail them into my government account,” Comey explained. “Or, if I still had to work on the draft, I would send it home so I could work on it on my laptop.”

“I was not talking about anything remotely classified and the inspector general didn’t say that as well,” Comey said. “But I get why the tweet, and I get why people are focused on it, but it’s a totally different thing.”

Comey first broke his silence on the inspector general report last week in an op-ed for the New York Times.

"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., used his speech at a Vermont rally to take parting shots at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos while discussing the wage gap in the U.S.

Sanders was in Vermont and New Hampshire to give a keynote speech at an AFL-CIO Labor Day breakfast event before holding two rallies, according to MyChamplainValley.com.

“We have one person whose wealth is increasing by $250 million every single day, while he pays thousands of his workers wages that are so low that they are forced to go on food stamps, Medicaid, and subsidized housing,” Sanders said, referencing Bezos.

BERNIE SANDERS TEES OFF ON TRUMP IN LABOR DAY VISIT TO KEY PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY STATE

Sanders also used his events to address Vermont workers.

“The reality is that the average American worker is still seeing a decline in his and her wages,” he said. “People continue to work longer hours for low wages. Here in Vermont, folks are working two or three jobs to put food on the table and pay bills.”

The senator’s shots at Amazon come days after he claimed the company doesn’t pay its employees enough and voiced concerns over conditions at fulfillment centers.

“Bottom line: the taxpayers of this country should not have to subsidize employees at a company owned by Mr. Bezos who is worth $155 billion. That is absurd,” Sanders wrote in a post Saturday.

Sanders also claimed Amazon had been “less than forthcoming with information about their employment practices.” He said the company’s average pay was about 9 percent less than industry average and “well below” a living wage.

Amazon refuted Sanders’ claims that it doesn’t pay employees a livable wage and therefore they have to rely on government programs such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

"The U.S. Air Force on Thursday released an aerial video that shows highlights of Tech Sgt. John Chapman’s heroics during hand-to-hand combat on an Afghanistan peak before he was killed by Al Qaeda militants.

Chapman, 36, a native of Windsor Locks, Conn., could be seen on March 4, 2002, charging the enemy on Takur Ghar, a 10,000-foot mountain, Task & Purpose reported. Chapman joined Navy SEALs in an effort to recover a wounded comrade who had fallen from the aircraft after it was hit with a rocket-propelled grenade.

Chapman ""charged into enemy fire through harrowing conditions,"" seized a bunker and killed its occupants, the White House said.

The Air Force said he was struck and temporarily incapacited by enemy fire when he moved from one protective cover to engage the enemy.

Britt K. Slabinski, a retired member of SEAL Team 6, who received the Medal of Honor in May for his heroics during the same 14-hour battle, believed Chapman was dead, and moved the team -- including someone with a serious leg injury -- off the battlefield, the New York Times reported.

Chapman regained consciousness and fought for an hour after being gunned down but managed to kill two more enemies, reports said.

Slabinski, who completed 15 combat tours, told the New York Times in 2016 that he was “95 percent certain” that Chapman was killed and was skeptical of the video's accuracy and analyses. He told officials that Chapman’s actions helped save his team that day.

Slabinski retired from the Navy in 2014 after more than 25 years of service. He said following the ceremony that the medal ""belongs to so many others"" and named the teammates ""who followed me without hesitation."" Slabinski said the medal also belongs to seven Americans who died on the mountaintop.

""They gave all for us. This honor is truly theirs. They are the true heroes,"" he said in a statement delivered on the White House driveway.

But Deborah Lee James, who worked under President Obama as the Air Force secretary, said Slabinski deserves his medal and his contributions shouldn't be underestimated.

“Nobody thinks that he did anything other than his absolute best on the worst day of his life,” James said of Slabinski, according to the Washington Post. “He thought he was dead, and he was responsible for four or five others that he was trying to save.”

President Trump will award the Medal of Honor posthumously to Chapman’s family on Aug. 22 -- 16 years after he died. He will be the first airman to receive the award since the Vietnam War.

James had recommended Chapman for the award, but she said it stalled.

“I believe the SEALs want to honor John Chapman,” James told the paper. “What some don’t want is they don’t want it linked to him getting back up and fighting back on.”

"On Wednesday I was working in my office when the phone rang and the operator announced: “Please hold for the president of the United States.” I resisted the impulse to make a joke: “I’m in the middle of something. Can you let him know I’ll call him right back?”

President Trump came on, and told me he was sitting in the Oval Office with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.

“You know John, don’t you?” the president said. I sheepishly said I didn’t, but of course I knew who he was. President Trump said I was a great voice for freedom and for America. Then he added: “Dinesh, I got to tell you, man to man, that you got screwed.”

President Trump said I did something that would normally get a slap on the wrist and a fine, but instead the previous administration went after me with the full force of its powers.

President Trump termed my case as an injustice, one that he was in a position to correct. And then came the words that I had to repeat to myself to fully grasp their significance. “I’ve decided to give you a full pardon.”

The president said this would clear my record “and now you can be an even bigger champion of freedom than before.”

I could do little more than mutter my grateful astonishment.

Later, the president told the media that he thought I was having a heart attack. Actually, I was just tongue-tied with joy. And the conversation ended with President Trump saying he would make his decision public the following morning, not with a news release but with a tweet.

For me, the pardon was the exhilarating conclusion to a five-year ordeal.

In 2012, in an attempt to help my longtime college friend Wendy Long, who was running as a Republican for the U.S. Senate in New York, I asked two of my associates to donate $10,000 apiece to her campaign. Then I reimbursed them. In doing so, I broke the law by exceeding the campaign finance limit.

Now it is an open secret that campaign finance limits are regularly transgressed just about every election season. Yet such cases are rarely prosecuted. In general, the government only goes after chronic or repeat offenders, or after those who break the law with corrupt intent, seeking to buy favors or obtain some sort of quid pro quo.

Consider the recent case of liberal comedian Rosie O’Donnell, who has acknowledged exceeding the campaign finance limits on five separate occasions, in five separate jurisdictions.

While O’Donnell’s motives were not corrupt, she certainly is a repeat offender. Consequently, there are five times more reasons to prosecute O’Donnell than there were to prosecute me.

No corruption or quid pro quo was even alleged in my case. In fact, candidate Wendy Long didn’t even know that I had contributed $30,000 instead of the allowable limit of $10,000.

How, then, did the decision to prosecute me come about?

Some clues are contained in my FBI file. A congressional oversight committee tried for well over a year to get this file. The FBI, then under since-fired Director James Comey, refused on familiar pretexts: claims that my file would reveal confidential sources, contained information that would jeopardize the bureau’s work, blah, blah, blah. Finally, the FBI relented and provided a redacted version of the file.

The file reveals that as soon as the FBI learned about my situation – how it found out is still unclear – the agency allocated $100,000 to investigate case involving $20,000 of political contributions. This by itself is odd.

The oddity, however, disappears with another revelation in the file. The FBI from the outset red-flagged me as a prominent conservative critic of the Obama administration.

Why is this information about my political views even in my file? How is it relevant? The obvious answer is that the FBI was signaling to the Obama Justice Department – in other words, to Attorney General Eric Holder – that here was a political adversary that the Obama team might want to go after.

And that’s why the FBI was so reluctant to give up the file. It didn’t want the Republicans in Congress to discover the bureau’s corrupt modus operandi.

The stage was set for my prosecution, carried out by the Department of Justice and directed by Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

Bharara tweeted Thursday that while President Trump has the right to pardon anyone he wants to, the fact is that I voluntarily pleaded guilty to a felony violation. Bharara’s logic is clear: why would someone who did not intentionally break the law publicly confess that he broke the law?

Here’s why: Bharara’s prosecutors charged me with exceeding campaign finance limits. But when they learned that I might plead not guilty, they threatened to add a second charge. What, you might wonder, was this second violation? What else did I do wrong?

Turns out, nothing.

The second charge I was threatened with was called filing a false document. Evidently, I did this by not revealing that I was the source of the contributions made in the name of my associates. In other words, this charge was just another way of describing the first charge.

The difference, however, is that the first charge carried a maximum of two years in federal prison, while the second charge carried up to five years. The bottom line was that the federal government was threatening me with a sentence so severe it would ruin my life.

Then members of Bharara’s team said that if I pleaded guilty to the first charge, they would drop the second. They bludgeoned me into submitting to a lesser sentence rather than risk complete professional and personal destruction.

While this is a standard tactic used by prosecutors – it is the single factor that explains why federal criminal cases have a conviction rate approaching 100 percent – it’s important to realize that the government is pressuring not only the guilty, but also the innocent to plead guilty.

I find it almost comical to see Bharara put on a straight face and present the outcome of strong-arm bullying as “voluntary” confession. One has to be utterly naive to fall for such deceit.

My only consolation is that Bharara’s whole scheme has collapsed. He tried to destroy a fellow Indian-American’s life out of naked political ambition. Then President Trump fired him and pardoned me!

Bharara is discovering the ancient Indian wisdom contained in the modern American saying that “karma is a bitch.”

My case, alas, represents a grotesque miniature of what American politics has become. It wasn’t always this way.

President Jimmy Carter or even President Bill Clinton would no more dream of locking up opponents like me than the Bushes would dream of locking up leftist filmmaker Michael Moore or Rosie O’Donnell.

But with President Obama and Hillary Clinton, we’ve see a gangsterization of politics in which the organs of the state – the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Justice Department and so on – are deployed against ideological adversaries.

I’m glad to be out of the clutches of these nefarious characters, including the judge appointed by President Clinton who included in my sentence mandatory psychiatric counseling. This is a man who thought he could supervise my “re-education,” which I guess would be confirmed in his mind if I went to work for the Clinton Foundation or started making regular appearances on MSNBC.

Eventually, to his dismay, the judge gave up on his little Stalinist project and confessed that I could not, by his standards, be rehabilitated.

Now I’m free. No longer does the ominous phrase, “United States of America versus Dinesh D’Souza” ring in this immigrant’s head. My American Dream and my faith in America are now fully restored.

Thank you, President Trump, for making this happen.",politics
"When Nikki Haley started as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, she warned she'd be “taking names” of countries that do not have “our back.” Now, a newly released annual State Department report on voting records at the world body will tell her who exactly is in America’s corner – and who is not.

The report found that U.N. member states only voted with the United States 31 percent of the time last year on resolutions at the U.N. General Assembly – down 10 percent from the prior year. Reacting to the new report, Haley said in a statement that it was not an “acceptable return” on the United States’ investment and suggested this could factor into aid decisions.

Haley emphasized that U.S. taxpayers pay for 22 percent of the U.N. budget – more, she said, than the next three highest donor nations combined. Haley noted that the U.S. cares more about “being right than popular and are once again standing up for our interests and values” but said:

“Either way, this is not an acceptable return on our investment. When we arrived at the UN last year, we said we would be taking names, and this list of voting records speaks for itself. President Trump wants to ensure that our foreign assistance dollars – the most generous in the world – always serve American interests, and we look forward to helping him see that the American people are no longer taken for granted.”

First published in 1984, “The report to the Congress on Voting Practices in the United Nations” reviews voting of the 193 members of the U.N. General Assembly (UNGA) and the 15 members of the Security Council, as well as several other items including resolutions related to Israel.

According to the report, the country that voted least with the U.S. was Zimbabwe – having voted zero times with America. According to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign aid explorer website, Zimbabwe received $58 million in aid for this year.

Rounding out the bottom 10 nations not aligned with the U.S. were: Burundi, which received $2.9 million in U.S. aid; Iran (no U.S. aid); Syria ($72 million); Venezuela ($230,000); North Korea (no U.S. aid); Turkmenistan ($200,0000); Cuba ($115,000); Bolivia ($115,000); and South Africa ($100 million). All figures are from the USAID explorer website.

As the largest contributor to the United Nations, U.S. taxpayers gave $10 billion in 2016 for voluntary and assessed contributions. Voluntary contributions go to fund agencies such as UNICEF and the World Food Program (WFP). Assessed contributions are obligatory payments made by all member states and based on such things as per capita income and population. It funds peacekeeping and the regular budget of the U.N.

Mark Leon Goldberg, editor of the news and commentary website UN Dispatch, said the latest report isn’t truly representative.

'This is not an acceptable return on our investment.' - U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley

""This report misrepresents the true extent of cooperation and agreement with the United States at the U.N. because the 2017 report, unlike in past years, excludes decisions that are taken by consensus,” he said. “Votes by consensus represent the vast majority of decisions taken at the U.N. Excluding these decisions from the overall count gives the appearance that the U.N. is a far more adversarial place than it actually is.""

The report stated that it indeed used a new updated methodology intended “to capture more accurately the voting conduct of UN member states.” It also stated that votes on Israel skewered “their metrics for countries that oppose these resolutions.” Of the 93 total resolutions that needed a vote, one-quarter of them were on Israel.

According to the report, the country that voted most with the United States in the U.N. General Assembly was Israel. The other nine on the top 10 list were U.S. allies Micronesia, Canada, Marshall Islands, Australia, United Kingdom, France, Palau, Ukraine and the Czech Republic.

Asked if the new report could lead to the U.S. cutting funding to the U.N., Stephane Dujarric, the spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told Fox News that, “Obviously member states vote the way they want to vote. For the Secretary General the engagement of the United States, engagement with the United States at the United Nations is critical, it is very important.” He concluded “that as for the scale of assessment, that’s a member state issue.”

Jonathan Wachtel, a former director of communications for Haley at the U.S. Mission to the U.N., told Fox News that as the United States is the largest contributor and most powerful member of the world body, “it is understandable that frustration arises when Washington's foreign policy goals come under assault at the institution.”

Wachtel continued, “While it is important for the United States to turn to the U.N. to work with other nations to achieve peace and security in troubled parts of the world, it is wrong for the U.S. to simultaneously turn a blind eye to dismissive practices by irresponsible countries.” It is also wrong, he said, for enemies of the U.S. to use the U.N. to boost their power, manipulate the system to get aid and yet work to compromise U.S. sovereignty.

Martin Edwards, a professor at Seton Hall University’s School of Diplomacy and International Relations in New Jersey, told Fox News that the report provided a “nice grandstanding tactic” for Haley but said it raised more questions than answers.

“It’s unclear what this will mean for current foreign aid recipients -- are we really going to give less humanitarian aid to South Sudan? How does that advance our interests?” he said.",politics
"“This is just a distraction,” Democratic pollster Mark Mellman says of the news the FBI is reexamining the Clinton email case.

During a press conference — which lasted all of three minutes — Hillary Clinton herself said, “I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails. I think that’s factored into that people think and now they’re choosing a president.”

But for people in the intelligence community -- including disgruntled FBI agents and even former officials in the Pentagon, it’s not that easy.

WEINER, CLINTON AND THE FBI'S CHANCE AT REDEMPTION =AN ELECTION NIGHTMARE

The revival of the Clinton email scandal reminds them of just how exposed Clinton left highly classified information.

Last September, an FBI report noted the bureau couldn’t find proof her private email server was hacked into by adversaries. But it noted that the private server had to be shut down repeatedly because of hacker attacks and a successful attack wasn’t likely to have left fingerprints. Also, some ""hostile foreign actors"" were able to break into the personal email accounts of Clinton’s close aides, obtaining a treasure trove of emails exchanged with her personal account.

Note that so far none of the WikiLeaks revelations have come from Hillary’s personal account. That could mean it wasn’t hacked, or it could mean that “hostile” actors are waiting to make use of them.

Given the growing suspicions that the Clinton Foundation may have exchanged favors with the Clinton State Department, her private server could be of great interest in establishing such links.

In short, we have to acknowledge the danger that Hillary Clinton could be the target of international blackmail in the White House.

Consider what happened the first time the Clinton couple was there. Bill Clinton’s involvement with the intern Monica Lewinsky had national security implications and also subjected him to possible blackmail.

Secret Service agent Gary Bryne reported in his book ‘Crisis of Character” that U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded that Russia, the U.K. and Israel had intercepted phone calls between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.

In 2000, Insight magazine, after a one-year investigation by a team of reporters, claimed that the Israeli government had “penetrated four White House telephone lines and was able to relay real-time conversations on those lines from a remote site outside the White House directly to Israel for listening and recording.”

Boris Yeltsin, the former Russian president, wrote in his memoirs that Russian intelligence had picked up on Clinton’s “predilection for beautiful young women.”

From agreeing to talk with the insecure Lewinsky on short notice to making sure she had a job to her liking at the Pentagon (with a security clearance!) President Clinton did a great deal to keep Lewinsky quiet. Nonetheless, she ended up discussing her affair with 11 people. One of those was Linda Tripp, a Pentagon official who recorded their talks. But what if Tripp or someone else had taken those tapes to Chinese or Iranian diplomats instead of Kenneth Starr, the special prosecutor?

Indeed, in his book “Clinton, Inc.,” journalist Daniel Halper reports that there was a blackmail attempt against Bill Clinton.

In October 1998 in a bid to gain the release of Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard, an Israeli team led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to blackmail President Clinton with tapes of Clinton and Lewinsky.

When Clinton brought Israel’s request for Pollard’s release to CIA Director George Tenet, Tenet threatened to resign on the spot should Clinton cave and release Pollard. Clinton ultimately declined the Israeli request, though he would consider it once again before the end of his term.

In fact, Clinton was all too aware of the security risk the Lewinsky relationship represented. The Starr Report, released in September 1998, reveals that Clinton told Lewinsky that ""he suspected that a foreign embassy was tapping his telephones, and he proposed cover stories"" if they were ever questioned about their relationship.

The president and Lewinsky had ""phone sex"" 10 to 15 times, so Clinton told Lewinsky that, if asked, she should say ""they knew their calls were being monitored all along, and the phone sex was just a put-on."" This laughable ""explanation"" wouldn't have helped much if a foreign power had intercepted the explicit calls.

""I'm just horrified to think the commander-in-chief is conducting himself with such reckless disregard for his responsibilities, making himself part and parcel of every blackmail threat that one can imagine,"" retired Marine Lt. Gen. Charles Cooper told the Washington Times in 1998.

The Code of Federal Regulations (Title 32, Chapter 1, Part 147) makes clear that a person may lose a security clearance for ""concealment of information that may increase an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail.”

Presidents have enforced such laws by issuing edicts such as Executive Order No. 12968 in August 1995. It states that individuals eligible for access to classified material must have a record of ""strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion."" It was signed by President Clinton. Three months later he began a relationship with an intern named Monica Lewinsky

The American people will have to decide if, after 20 years, the Clintons have really changed the way they operate and can be trusted to retake control of the Oval Office.

"A knife-wielding suspect who slashed five people, killing one, in central Paris on Saturday night -- before being slain by French authorities -- has been identified as a native of Chechnya, born in 1997, a French judicial official said.

The parents of the suspect, who was claimed as a “soldier” of ISIS after the attack, have been detained for questioning, the official said.

No other information about the attacker was immediately available.

The Islamic State group, through its affiliated news agency, claimed responsibility for the knife attack, which left a 29-year-old man dead and four others injured.

In a tweet sharing his condolences for the victims, French President Emmanuel Macron labeled the attacker a “terrorist.”

“All my thoughts go to the victims and the wounded of the knife attack perpetrated tonight in Paris, as well as to their relatives. I salute on behalf of all the French the courage of the policemen who have neutralized the terrorist,” a translation of his tweet said.

“France once again paid the price of blood but did not give an inch to the enemies of Freedom,” Macron said in another tweet.

ISIS said the attack was in response to its calls for supporters to target members of the U.S.-led military coalition squeezing extremists out of Iraq and Syria, the Aamaq news agency said in a statement.

“France once again paid the price of blood, but did not give an inch to the enemies of Freedom.” - Emmanuel Macron, president of France

In the U.S., State Department officials voiced their concern.

""We are closely monitoring the incident in Paris, and understand the authorities have initiated a terror probe,"" a State Department spokesperson told Fox News. ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those affected. We refer you to the local authorities for further information.

""We stand ready to provide all possible consular assistance should we become aware of any affected U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens in the France are strongly encouraged to directly contact concerned family members in the United States to advise them of your safety.‎""

The suspect carried out the stabbing attack Saturday evening in the 2nd Arrondissement of Paris, north of the Seine River.

Counterterrorism authorities were called in to lead the investigation after Prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters that witnesses heard the suspect shouting, ""Allahu Akbar"" -- ""God is great"" in Arabic.

The assailant, after attacking bystanders with a knife, rushed at police, shouting “I will kill you, I will kill you!” police union representative Rocco Contento told Reuters.

The attacker was then shot by officers and later confirmed dead, Paris police said.

Witnesses reportedly said that the police first tried to use a stun gun on the attacker, but when that failed, they fired two shots, the BBC reported, citing France24.

The attack took place in a popular neighborhood near Paris’ famed Opera Garnier. People were asked to evacuate nearby buildings.

Police said the suspect targeted the five people.

France's BFM television interviewed an unnamed witness in a restaurant who said a young woman was at the entrance when ""a man arrived and attacked her with a knife."" A friend came to her aid and the attacker left, ""hitting on all the doors, all the shops,"" the witness told BFM. He turned onto another street, and everyone scattered, the witness said.

""I was having a drink with friends and we heard a boom,"" a witness named Gloria, who had been in a nearby bar, recounted on Saturday night. She said she went outside to see what happened and ""I saw a guy lying on the ground.""

Another witness described leaving the opera house and being told to go back inside because of the attack.

Interior Minister Gerard Collomb denounced the attack in a tweet.

""My first thoughts are with the victims of this odious act,"" a translation said.

Collomb said the lives of the injured people were no longer in danger.

Paris has been under elevated security in recent years after a string of deadly Islamic extremist attacks.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"A 28-year-old woman became the first person in Denmark to be fined under a new law which prohibits wearing garments that cover the face in public after an incident at a shopping center on Friday.

Danish news agency Ritzau reported that police were called to a shopping center in Horsholm, a city of 46,000 located north of Copenhagen, to confront a woman wearing a niqab garment covering her face.

After police were called, they found the woman had been illegally wearing a niqab in public and after she removed it issued a fine of 1,000 Danish kroner, or $156, Sky News reported.

Denmark's facial covering law went into effect on Wednesday, and brings the country in line with similar laws in France and Belgium that prohibit full-body burqas, as well the niqab — Muslim dress which only shows the eyes. Both are rare in Denmark.

"SINGAPORE -- A select few of President Trump’s closest aides will witness and participate in the historic summit Tuesday with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, according to new details released by the White House – which says discussions surrounding the sit-down “have moved more quickly than expected.”

A White House statement confirmed that Trump and the reclusive North Korean leader will meet at 9 a.m. local time on Tuesday (9 p.m. ET on Monday) in Singapore.

They will first enter a one-on-one meeting with translators only, the first meeting ever between a U.S. president and North Korea’s leader – and Trump’s first opportunity to gauge Kim’s willingness to negotiate on dismantling his nuclear weapons program.

From there, according to the White House, the meeting will expand to include Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Adviser John Bolton.

As first reported by Fox News, a working lunch will then be held including Press Secretary Sarah Sanders; National Security Council Senior Director for Asia Matt Pottinger; and Sung Kim, U.S. ambassador to the Philippines and a former North Korea policy official.

Kim Jong Un is expected to have a small contingent including Kim Yong Chol, who visited Trump at the White House in the run-up to the summit to deliver a letter from the North Korean dictator.

The details were falling into place at a rapid pace. A State Department spokesperson said the U.S. and North Korean delegations have held a second meeting in advance of the summit.

Pompeo told reporters earlier Monday that the U.S. is “prepared to make security assurances” for North Korea if they denuclearize.

The summit itself is set to kick off with a handshake between Trump and Kim, a symbolic image that may define the future of millions of people.

The U.S. president said Saturday that he’ll understand Kim’s intentions “within the first minute” of meeting him and whether he’s willing to give up the nuclear arsenal.

“I feel that Kim Jong Un wants to do something great for his people,” Trump said at a press conference in Canada during the G7 summit over the weekend. “It’s a one-time shot and I think it’s going to work out very well.”

But he urged caution, adding that “there’s a good chance it won’t work out” and that “there’s probably an even better chance it will take a period of time.”

“I think the minimum would be relationship. You would start at least a dialogue, because, you know, as a deal person, I have done very well with deals,” Trump said of his expectations.

Pyongyang indicated that it may be open to getting rid of its nuclear weapons in exchange for the U.S. security guarantees and other benefits, though some believe it’s an unrealistic prospect as the nuclear arsenal cements Kim’s grip on the country and deters all-out attacks against them.

But the two sides could come up with a peace treaty that would formally end the Korean War. Trump also raised the possibility of further summits in the future.

Bolton, meanwhile, is said to be highly involved in the process – and will be present at all significant meetings, Fox News is told.

This is significant, as Bolton raised alarm in Pyongyang after he suggested applying the “Libya model” to North Korea – Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi was killed in an uprising years after he gave up the country’s weapons-of-mass-destruction program.

"Several swing-vote senators, including moderate Republicans and vulnerable Democrats in red states, have given GOP leaders cause for optimism that Brett Kavanaugh will soon be confirmed to replace retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court.

Though Kavanaugh's confirmation remains uncertain because of Republicans' razor-thin 51-49 majority in the Senate, the moderates' early reactions indicate that millions of dollars in spending by liberal groups to sway key senators against Kavanaugh may ultimately prove fruitless.

Only 50 votes are needed to confirm Kavanaugh, after Republicans eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees last year.

Democratic leaders had removed the filibuster for other federal judgeships in 2013 to confirm President Barack Obama's nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which was prompted by GOP obstruction that followed extensive Democratic filibustering of President George W. Bush's nominees to federal judgeships.

One Democratic senator facing a pitched re-election battle, Missouri's Claire McCaskill, has already given indications that she is closely weighing the political ramifications of voting down the nomination.

""If you’re going to ask me questions about the Supreme Court nominee, I have absolutely nothing to say,"" McCaskill repeatedly said on Thursday.

And two key moderate Republicans -- Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine -- reportedly did not voice any concerns about Kavanaugh in a closed-door meeting of GOP officials this week.

In public, Collins praised Kavanaugh's impressive credentials"" and ""extensive experience.""

“It will be very difficult for anyone to argue that he’s not qualified for the job. He clearly is qualified for the job,” Collins told reporters. “But there are other issues involving judicial temperament and his ... judicial philosophy that also will play into my decision.”

Meanwhile, Murkowski made it clear that she felt Kavanaugh was a better pick than other nominees Trump was considering, oweing to his lengthy record and stated support of precedent, including Roe v. Wade. Both senators voted for Kavanaugh's confirmation to the D.C. Circuit.

The two pro-choice moderates have said they would not support a nominee who would overturn Roe v. Wade. They also joined Arizona Sen. John McCain -- whose illness will likely render him unable to vote for Kavanaugh despite his support for the nominee -- in stopping a GOP bid to repeal ObamaCare last year.

JOHN FUND: DEMS' 'PROJECT FEAR' AIMS TO FLIP COLLINS, MURKOWSKI WITH ROE V. WADE PARANOIA

Well-heeled liberal groups are hoping for a similar defection now, as they seek to pressure Murkowski and Collins into voting down Kavanaugh's confirmation.

Even former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken has gotten in on the action, writing a lengthy series of hypothetical questions that he would have asked Kavanuagh at his confirmation hearing -- had he not been unceremoniously unseated from the Senate and the Judiciary Committee last year amid allegations he tried to forcibly kiss multiple women and grope another on-camera.

""They don't want to be the deciding vote on this; we're going to force them to be the deciding vote on this,"" Ezra Levin, the founder of the progressive group Indivisible Project, said on MSNBC last week.

An onslaught of money is pouring into Maine and Alaska, as well as states with moderate Democrats up for re-election this year, from both conservative and liberal organizations. Leading the progressive charge are the newly created group Demand Justice, as well as Naral Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood.

Demand Justice alone expects to spend $5 million on advertising related to the nomination, while a conservative group called the Judicial Crisis Network expects to spend nearly $10 million.

That money won't be limited to Alaska and Maine. Democrats are also hoping to convince vulnerable senators in states that support Trump to put their political lives on the line by trying to block Kavanaugh's confirmation.

FMR KAVANAUGH LAW CLERK SPEAKS OUT ABOUT WHAT JUDGE WAS LIKE ON AND OFF THE BENCH

Among those moderate Democrats up for re-election this year in states that went for Trump in 2016 are Indiana's Joe Donnelly, West Virginia's Joe Manchin, and North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp.

Unlike McCaskill, all three voted to confirm the more conservative Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court last year -- even though New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillbirand claimed erroneously on CNN that no Democrats had voted for Gorsuch.

But while Donnelly and Heitkamp said only that they would carefully screen Kavanaugh, Manchin struck a more cautionary tone in his statement following Kavanaugh's nod and focused primarily on health-care issues.

""The Supreme Court will ultimately decide if nearly 800,000 West Virginians with pre-existing conditions will lose their healthcare,"" Manchin said. ""This decision will impact almost 40% of my state, so I’m very interested in his position on protecting West Virginians with pre-existing conditions.”

Alabama Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who recently won a special election and will up for election in 2020, has stayed mostly mum on Kavanaugh -- promising only a ""thorough vetting"" of his credentials. But analysts say he would face significant political consequences if he tried to derail Kavanaugh's nomination.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said on Fox & Friends last week that Democrats can't be counted on to buck their party leadership unless Kavanaugh's confirmation is already assured.

“I think that we can’t count on any Democrats until we get the 50 votes we need, and then we’ll get five or six of them,” Grassley said. “Otherwise, I don’t think we can count on them.”

But, he added, something would have to “very dramatically go wrong” to lose the votes of Murowski and Collins.

Speaking on ""Cavuto Live"" on Saturday, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, also predicted that all Republicans would support Kavanaugh.

""I can't speak for any colleague, but I nonetheless predict we’ll end up with every Republican supporting Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation,"" Lee said. ""I also think we’ll end up with a few Democrats.""

Lee also sharply criticized Hillary Clinton's ""absurd, hyperbolic"" claims that Kavanaugh's nomination would turn the clock back to the 19th century, saying the former first lady ""should be ashamed of the comments.""",politics
"Texas won’t allow schools to use state funding to educate immigrant children while they are being housed in federal detention – something that would have cost millions, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) said.

The education agency told Austin-based charter school group Southwest Key, Promesa Public Schools, that local schools that want to serve migrant students in federal custody can’t “do so with state education funding,” The Houston Chronicle reported.

Southwest Key, one of the largest nonprofits operating shelters for migrant children in Texas, said the agency’s stance jeopardizes partnerships the shelters have formed with at least two traditional school districts, one of which would have funneled millions of Texas tax dollars.

""I think the ones that ultimately are affected adversely are the youth that are in the shelters,"" Salvador Cavazos, the nonprofit's vice president for education services told the paper. ""Because we're in a partnership, we would have been able to provide additional resources, partner with credit-bearing institutions, provide grades and help them achieve credits go to other public schools.""

Texas officials say it falls under the legal obligation of the federal government to educate the migrant children.

This comes amid the debate of what to do with minors who cross the border illegally.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement requires school-age children in shelters to receive at least six hours of structured education during the week.

Texas officials say schools still could voluntarily provide help to shelters. But school leaders across the state say their schools have been dealing with declining state funding for years, which makes it impractical to pay to provide services to students who aren't technically enrolled in their districts.

President Trump signed an executive order that stopped family separations at the border in June.

The Supreme Court has previously ruled that all children – regardless of immigration status – are entitled to a public education.

"Former President Barack Obama, in a rare post-presidency speech abroad, took several thinly veiled shots at his successor and other populist “right-wing billionaires” -- while openly touting a controversial liberal push for ""universal income.""

In one of his biggest speeches since leaving the White House, Obama delivered the 2018 Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture in Johannesburg, South Africa on Tuesday. He used the platform to rail against populist movements, which have gained strength in the U.S. and Europe.

“Given the strange and uncertain times we are in—and they are strange, and they are uncertain—with each day’s news cycles bringing more head spinning and disturbing headlines, I thought maybe it would be useful to step back for a moment and try to get some perspective,” Obama began.

Obama went on to slam the “right-wing billionaires"" leading populist movements, in a clear reference to President Trump and like-minded politicians in Europe.

“Populist movements, cynically funded by right-wing billionaires worried about their own interests,” Obama said. “These movements tapped the unease that was felt by so many people who live outside of urban course. That their social status and privileges were eroding … threatened by outsiders, those who don’t look like them or sound like them.”

Obama added that the “politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment” have begun to “appear.”

“I’m not being alarmist. I’m simply stating the facts. Look around—strongman politics are ascendant, suddenly, whereby elections and some pretense of democracy are maintained, the form of it, where those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning,” he said.

Obama also blasted what he described as “barely hidden racial nationalism.”

The speech comes a day after Trump held a controversial summit and press conference with Russia's Vladimir Putin, where the U.S. president did not openly challenge Putin's denial of U.S. election meddling. Several Obama allies and former officials slammed Trump, though Obama himself did not directly address it.

Trump on Tuesday defended his handling of the summit, saying ""the Fake News is going Crazy!"" Further, he has accused Obama of failing to curb the election interference, tweeting that Obama thought Hillary Clinton would win so ""did NOTHING about it.""

Obama, meanwhile, on Tuesday seemed to embrace some talking points of the resurgent progressive left -- including opening the door to proposals for a guaranteed income. One such proposal is being considered in Chicago.

""It's not just money a job provides,"" Obama said. ""It provides dignity and structure and a sense of place and a sense of purpose. So we're going to have to consider new ways of thinking about these problems, like a universal income, review of our work week, how we retrain our young people, how we make everybody an entrepreneur at some level. But we're going have to worry about economics if we want to get democracy back on track.""

Obama also called on the wealthy, like him, to do their part.

""I am surprised at how much money I've got. I don't have half as much as these others, but there's only so much you can eat, only so many nice trips you can take,"" Obama said, met by applause. ""I mean, it's enough. You don't have to take a vow of poverty to say let me help others out. I'll pay a little more in taxes. It's okay, I can afford it.""

The former president also warned that the “free press” was under attack, and that social media is now used for “propaganda” and “conspiracy theories.”

Obama touched on the heated immigration debate, and acknowledged that “natural borders matter.”

“Laws need to be followed. Newcomers should adapt to customs of their new home. But that can’t be an excuse for immigration policies based on race or religion,” Obama said. “We can enforce law while respecting humanity of those seeking a better life.”

Using Mandela's nickname, he went on: “So on Madiba’s 100th birthday, we now stand at a crossroads. ... We have a better story to tell. To say our vision for the future is better is not to say that it will inevitably win. Because history also shows the power of fear. History shows the lasting hold of greed and the desire to dominate others in the minds of men. Especially men.”

Obama concluded: “Keep believing. Keep marching. Keep building. Keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world.”",politics
"Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort reportedly tried to strike a plea deal with prosecutors last week ahead of his second trial, but failed to reach an agreement.

The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the discussions, reported Monday that the negotiations between Manafort’s defense team and prosecutors occurred during jury deliberations last week during his trial on bank and tax fraud charges. Those talks came to a halt after Special Counsel Robert Mueller brought up certain issues, the report said.

It was not clear what the issues entailed, or what was specifically being discussed regarding the plea deal itself, according to the Journal. The negations were reportedly centered around preventing a second trial that Manafort faces next month on similar charges.

The Journal reported that both Manafort and Mueller's team declined to comment for the report. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News.

After four days of deliberations, Manafort was found guilty on eight counts of bank and tax fraud for hiding millions of dollars he earned from his political consulting in Ukraine. The jury was deadlocked on 10 other counts. A juror told Fox News that one lone holdout prevented a conviction of all 18 counts.

Manafort faces a second trial in Washington on charges that include conspiring against the United States, conspiring to launder money, failing to register as an agent of a foreign principal and providing false statements.

The news comes after President Donald Trump addressed Manafort’s conviction during a Fox News interview on Thursday, in which he said he had “great respect"" for ""what he's done... what he's gone through.""

The president noted that unlike his former attorney Michael Cohen, who admitted last week to campaign finance violations by arranging hush money payments “at the direction” of then-candidate Trump, Manafort did not “flip.”

Cohen could have received up to 65 years in prison if convicted of all charges. However, as part of his plea deal, Cohen agreed not to challenge any sentence between 46 and 63 months. The deal does not involve a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors.

“I’ve seen it many times,” Trump told Fox News. “I’ve had many friends involved in this stuff. It’s called flipping and it almost ought to be illegal.”

Manafort is facing a maximum sentence of 80 years in prison.

Each Friday, volunteer medic Asmaa Qudih goes through a tense ritual: She prays, kisses her mother's hand and packs a bag with medical supplies as she heads off to work at the weekly mass protests along Gaza's border fence with Israel.

Treating the wounded has become dangerous for Gaza's emergency workers. In the past five months, three medics were killed by Israeli army fire, while dozens more, including Qudih, were hurt by live fire or tear gas canisters.

Qudih, 35, says the weekly routine is terrifying, but that national pride, religious devotion and professional ambition drive her and other medics to risk their lives.

""As long as you go to work in the field, you expect at any time to get injured or killed,"" she said on a recent Friday as she prepared to head to the frontier.

Before leaving home, she inspected her red backpack, filled with bandages, sticky tape and the saline spray that soothes the effects of tear gas on the eyes and skin. She hugged her young nieces and nephews, and then solemnly kissed her mother farewell.

""She goes against my will,"" said her mother, Fatma, as she showered Qudih with blessings. ""But this is her decision.""

In the latest violence, witnesses said volunteer paramedic Shorouq Msameh was shot in the back Friday while standing about 300 meters (yards) from a fence during a protest east of Rafah as demonstrators tried to launch a burning tire toward Israeli territory. Msameh, who was wearing a white coat marking her as a medic, was listed in critical condition at a hospital in nearby Khan Younis.

The plight of Gaza's medics lies at the heart of a debate over Israel's use of force in the protests. European and U.N. officials, along with international rights groups, accuse Israel of using excessive force, citing the large numbers of civilian casualties, including medical workers. The U.N. and World Health Organization have both said Israel is obligated to allow medics to work safely.

Israel says it does not intentionally target medics and even tries to protect them but accuses militants of mixing in with the crowds. Last month, Israel said a Palestinian nurse from the group Doctors Without Borders tried to carry out a late-night cross-border shooting attack on Israeli troops. Israel apparently killed the man, but has not revealed details.

Qudih never planned to work at the protests, which are aimed in part at trying to break a blockade of Gaza imposed by Israel and Egypt to weaken the ruling Islamic militant group Hamas. The marches, led by Hamas but also driven by the desperation of Gaza residents over blockade-linked hardships, typically take place on Fridays along a perimeter fence.

On March 30, the day of the first march, Qudih walked about half an hour from her home in the southern town of Abassan to the nearest protest site to watch.

She saw thousands of Palestinians marching close to the frontier, burning tires and hurling rocks and firebombs in the direction of Israeli soldiers, including snipers behind earthen mounds on the other side of the fence. Soldiers responded with live fire and tear gas.

Fifteen people, mostly young men, were killed that day, and hundreds more were badly wounded. Protesters and medics struggled to evacuate the wounded, in many cases carrying them ""improperly and hastily"" to ambulances or private cars, she recalled.

Noticing the shortage of paramedics, Qudih volunteered as an emergency responder.

""Seeing the injured in front of me gave me the courage to provide them the needed service,"" she said.

The job has proved to be dangerous. In five months of marches, 125 Palestinians have been killed and about 4,500 others have been wounded by gunfire, according to Gaza health officials and rights groups. Palestinian officials say the vast majority were unarmed.

Among the dead have been three paramedics, including Razan Najjar, a 21-year-old woman who also worked as a volunteer with Qudih in the Khuzaa protest camp. All wore white or fluorescent uniforms identifying themselves as medics.

Witnesses said Najjar had just helped treat a protester when she was shot in the chest. Qudih, who did not see it, said word spread quickly among her colleagues.

""We collected ourselves and hurried to the hospital, all the medics,"" she said. ""There was big pain and shock.""

At least 100 medical workers have been injured by gunshots, shrapnel and direct hits from tear gas canisters, according to al-Mezan, a leading Gaza-based rights group. Rescuers typically walk slowly, their hands raised, when approaching the border to treat the wounded.

""They noticeably target the medical crews recently,"" Qudih alleged.

Qudih herself was hit with a tear gas canister dropped from a drone on May 14, the most violent day of the marches, in which about 60 Palestinians were killed. The canister knocked her unconscious and she was briefly hospitalized to have her head stitched up.

After Najjar, a friend and neighbor, was killed, Qudih decided to work at a field hospital, far from the front lines, for three weeks. And if she felt in danger, ""we would step back a little or hide ourselves behind a sand hill,"" she said.

She once scolded her young nephews when she saw them at a protest. ""Later, I felt embarrassed because the place was full of people and I looked as if caring for our children only.""

Her brother Loai initially objected to her going but eventually gave up. ""This is who she is,"" he said.

On a recent Friday, it didn't take long for Qudih to see action. Dozens of protesters ventured toward the border fence and set tires ablaze as Israeli forces responded with volleys of tear gas and occasional live fire.

Qudih, wearing a medical coat over her full-body Islamic gown, moved quickly to treat the wounded. She darted to the front lines, sprinkling saline on people lying on the ground until paramedics carried them away. When the acrid smoke cleared, she removed her medical mask and wiped her face with tissues.

Israel accuses Hamas of using the protests as cover to carry out attacks and says it is defending its border from infiltration attempts. One Israeli soldier has been killed by a Gaza sniper.

But Israel has come under heavy criticism because of the large number of unarmed protesters who have been shot. It came under similar criticism during a 2014 war with Hamas in which 11 paramedics were killed and 24 ambulances destroyed, according to al-Mezan.

In a statement, the Israel army denied targeting medical workers but said they operate very close to the fence ""and are often mixed between those carrying out attacks and those acting violently.""

It said commanders ""repeatedly and emphatically"" ordered their troops to avoid harming medical workers. It said troops generally stop their activities when medical personnel near the border, even though this can heighten risks to soldiers by allowing Hamas militants to approach.

""Nevertheless, despite these efforts, unintended harm to medical personnel may have been unavoidable in such volatile, challenging and chaotic situations,"" it said, adding that the deaths of medical personnel are being investigated.

Professional medics from the Health Ministry, Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society provide most of the care. But trainees and unpaid volunteers like Qudih have played supporting roles because of the many injured, al-Mezan said.

Being unemployed, Qudih said she hopes health officials will offer her a job. Unemployment in Gaza is close to 50 percent. But she said her main motivation is her ""national and religious duty"" — and to remember her friend, Razan Najjar.

""We continue our volunteer work here in great part as an honor to Razan,"" she said.",world
"Police officers in Paraguay doing inventory of the armory were surprised to find that thieves had taken 42 powerful rifles and replaced them with wooden and plastic replicas.

The inventory of the armory in the city of Capiata, about 15 miles south of the capital Asuncion, was ordered after FN FAL battle rifles used by police started appearing in the black market, BBC News reported. The rifles can fetch up to $10,000.

ABC Digital reported the rifles had been placed in the armory storage as the police force was replacing them for newer models. They were in good working condition.

The police officer in charge of the armory has been replaced, but no arrests have been made, BBC News reported.

Authorities believe the rifles may have been smuggled into Argentina or Brazil, who have been complaining that many illegal weapons seized had been smuggled in from Paraguay. Others could have been sold to gangs or local criminals, Infobae reported.",world
"California Democrats have declared war on one of the most popular family-owned hamburger chains on the West Coast.

Gabe Schneider, a Washington, D.C.-based journalist, discovered that In-N-Out Burger has been engaged in unseemly – if not downright scandalous – behavior.

“In-N-Out added a new item to their secret menu,” Schneider mischievously tweeted.

He then went on to explain that In-N-Out has donated $25,000 (gird yourselves, good readers) to the (no, really – gird yourselves) California Republican Party on Tuesday.

Oh, the humanity. Smelling salts, anyone?

In-N-Out is a beloved hamburger chain based in California and has a cult following. The chain’s double-double burgers, fresh-cut fries and a legendary secret menu have consistently landed it among the most favorite burger chains in the country.

In-N-Out is owned by a deeply religious family, known for discreetly placing Bible verses on hamburger wrappers and soft drink cups.

It's fair to say that In-N-Out is to beef what Chick-fil-A is to poultry.

So when the In-N-Out donation to the California Republican Party was exposed, Democrats and the mainstream media lost their lunch.

“Left-leaning Fast Food Fans Lose Appetite After In-N-Out Burger Donates to California Republicans,” Fortune.com announced.

“Your Favorite Burger Chain Just Donated a Bunch of Money to the Republican Party,” LAMag.com wrote.

“In-N-Out Burger Angers Customers by Donating to Republican Party,” US Weekly declared.

Eric Bauman, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, called for an immediate boycott.

“Et tu In-N-Out,” the state party chairman wrote on Twitter. “Tens of thousands of dollars donated to the California Republican Party…it’s time to #BoycottInNOut – let Trump and his cronies support these creeps…perhaps animal style.”

“Animal style,” by the way, refers to a popular In-N-Out specialty hamburger and not something inappropriate.

So what – now it's morally offensive for business owners to back pro-business Republicans in a state that is run by decidedly anti-business lawmakers?

Fortune.com reports that In-N-Out also donated money to a political action committee that supports Democratic candidates who are “considered cordial to businesses.”

I don't seem to recall any Republicans calling for a burger boycott over that.

In-N-Out has not commented on the controversy, nor should it. The owners of the company have a right to donate as they see fit.

The Democrats’ attacks on In-N-Out are eerily reminiscent of the Great Poultry War of 2012 – when liberals declared war on Chick-fil-A.

Feathers got ruffled when the company’s owner made comments affirming the biblical definition of marriage. Soon, the restaurant chain was facing a full scale assault from Democrats, the mainstream media and Hollywood.

An armistice of sorts was declared thanks to the fine peacekeeping work of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Hundreds of thousands of supporters rallied by vowing to eat more chicken.

But in the ensuing years there have been some minor skirmishes in places like Chicago, Boston and New York City – where Democratic lawmakers tried to stop Chick-fil-A from opening up restaurants. Their nefarious scheme backfired.

All that is to say that Democrats should tread carefully. They do not want a beef with California voters over their double-double with special sauce.

I stood with Chick-fil-A during the Great Poultry War and I am proud to stand alongside In-N-Out Burger.

The most effective way to fight back is to eat more beef, California (with apologies to the Chick-fil-A cows, of course).",politics
"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer suggested Tuesday that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had misled him during their hour-and-a-half one-on-one meeting at the Capitol, and claimed that Kavanaugh had failed to offer assurances that abortion rights would not be overturned if he is confirmed.

Schumer's broadsides were a preview of lines of attack Democratic senators are expected to use during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing in September.

""The judge either wouldn't answer, or couldn't remember key moments of his tenure. He acknowledged being part of the White House's response to the Enron case, but couldn't provide any details about what he did. ... His lack of recollection on almost everything didn’t ring true,"" Schumer, D-N.Y., said, referring to Kavanaugh's five years as a lawyer in the Bush administration. ""This is a bright man.""

Asked later by a reporter if he was accusing Kavanaugh of lying, Schumer said flatly, ""I'll leave it at what I said.""

The top Senate Democrat went on to criticize Kavanaugh's answers to his questions on abortion rights, a key issue for moderate Republican senators who could be pivotal in securing or denying Kavanaugh's confirmation.

""I understand that the judge told other members today that he considered Roe v. Wade settled law,"" Schumer said. ""He did not say that to me.""

The landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling struck down anti-abortion laws across the country by finding that an implicit constitutional right to privacy protected a women's rights to an abortion to varying degrees depending on trimester.

Schumer continued: ""I asked Judge Kavanaugh the appropriate question: I asked him if he agreed that Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood were correctly decided. He would not say yes. That should send shivers down the spine of any American who believes in reproductive freedom. ... He would not give me any reassurance that he believed Roe or Casey were correctly decided or should be left alone."" The Casey decision further clarified the right to an abortion.

""Judge Kavanaugh has a special obligation to make his views on this topic clear,"" Schumer said, dismissing what he said were Kavanaugh's comments during their meeting that all justices would say Roe was settled law. ""No other president has nominated someone to the Supreme Court after saying, 'I will only nominate someone who overturns Roe v. Wade.'""

Trump, who said during the 2016 presidential campaign that Roe would be overturned ""automatically"" if he could nominate several justices, has since said that his advisers told him not to ask Supreme Court nominees whether they would overturn Roe.

Earlier Tuesday, Kavanaugh told Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Maine Republican, that Roe v. Wade was settled law. Schumer had played down that comment, saying more needed to be known about his views on abortion.

Schumer told reporters, ""Of course we know Roe is settled law. We need to know if Judge Kavanaugh believes it was correctly decided.""



Schumer also took issue with Kavanaugh's previous writings on presidential power, saying, ""It’s very frightening the president wouldn’t have to comply with a subpoena."" Trump's legal team has argued repeatedly that a hypothetical subpoena for documents or testimony from Special Counsel Robert Mueller would be legally unjustifiable.

WATCH: GIULIANI SAYS PRESIDENTIAL SUBPOENA WOULD LEAD TO HUGE LEGAL BATTLE

Also on Tuesday, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said she remained noncommittal after meeting with Kavanaugh. McCaskill is one of 10 Democratic senators up for re-election this year in states that President Trump won in 2016. Trump won Missouri by nearly 19 percentage points and McCaskill is under intense pressure from outside groups seeking to sway her vote.

McCaskill said she talked to Kavanaugh Tuesday about his views on ensuring Missouri residents retained access to health care. She says they also talked about his view on ""removing dark money from politics, and guaranteeing powerful corporate interests don't prevail over individual Americans.""

Kavanaugh is meeting with lawmakers ahead of confirmation hearings, which are set to begin after Labor Day.

MEDIA'S BIGGEST KAVANAUGH MISSES: ATTEMPTED HIT PIECES ON NOMINEE DRAW MOCKERY

Meanwhile, Democrats searching through his files for lines of attacks are digging into his years with the Bush White House, where Kavanaugh worked as a lawyer. Kavanaugh served under Bush from 2001 to 2006. Democrats have said certain documents could reveal his views on high-profile issues including abortion rights and the torture of terror suspects.

""His lack of recollection on almost everything didn’t ring true. This is a bright man."" - Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer

The nominee's years working for independent counsel Ken Starr also are under the microscope. Media reports have focused recently on a 20-year-old memo in which Kavanaugh reportedly opposed giving then-President Bill Clinton a “break” in the Monica Lewinsky investigation.

Democrats have expressed frustration with how they were receiving documents they requested from Kavanaugh's lengthy tenure in Washington. Specifically, they have complained that most of the released documents have come from Bush's lawyer, Bill Burck, who is vetting them, rather than the traditional process conducted by the National Archives. They said Burck could well be withholding potentially embarrassing items.

Schumer and other top Democrats last week threatened to sue the National Archives if more documents are not handed over pursuant to their Freedom of Information Act request.

Republicans have allowed the release of well over 100,000 pages of Kavanaugh's papers, including papers from his time as a White House counsel to Bush, his later work as an appellate judge and his earlier time as aide to Starr, who investigated Clinton.

More are on track to be released. Democrats want the release of all Kavanaugh documents, including from his three years as White House staff secretary, which Republicans have refused to request from the National Archives. The Archives says those alone could total several million pages.

Schumer on Tuesday also commented briefly on the whirlwind news of the day, including the guilty plea of ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to campaign finance law violations and the guilty verdicts on eight counts in the bank and tax fraud trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

""I understand the president is going to a rally,"" Schumer said, referring to Trump's planned West Virginia rally in the evening. ""He had better not talk about pardons for Cohen or Manafort tonight -- or any time in the future.""

Schumer did not take additional questions from reporters on the Cohen or Manafort situations, saying he did not yet have the opportunity to review all the details.

"Close to 90 elephants have been found dead near a wildlife sanctuary in Botswana, according to conservationists, as the gentle giants are increasingly being threatened by poachers.

Non-profit group Elephants Without Borders, which is conducting a national elephant census, has found the “fresh and recent” carcasses of 87 poached elephants near the Okavango Delta wildlife sanctuary, director Mike Chase told the BBC. He said he was “shocked” at the findings in Botswana, which has long been viewed as a refuge for elephants.

OPINION: ELEPHANT TROPHIES? SERIOUSLY? THIS IS WHAT WASHINGTON IS SPENDING ITS TIME ON?

“I’m shocked, I’m completely astounded,” Chase said. “The scale of elephant poaching is by far the largest I’ve seen or read anywhere in Africa to date.”

Chase added that, compared to his 2015 census, “we are recording double the number of fresh poached elephants than anywhere else in Africa.”

The government of Botswana, home to an estimated 130,000 elephants, told The Associated Press that the non-profit’s information was inaccurate, and that some of the elephant carcasses found “were not poached but rather died from natural causes and retaliatory killings as a result of human and wildlife conflicts.”

The country, with a population of more than 2 million, suffers from some human-wildlife conflict but has more space than many other countries for animals to roam. Kenya, for example, has a population 25 times larger and is almost as big as Botswana in geographical size.

Security in Botswana has often been known to quickly open fire on poaching suspects, including Namibians and Zimbabweans who were killed after illegally crossing the border.

Chase told the news station that the group was warning “of an impending problem and we thought we were prepared for it.”

ELEPHANTS RARELY GET CANCER BECAUSE THEIR BODIES HAVE A RARE 'ZOMBIE GENE'

After poachers wiped out large numbers of elephants in neighboring Zambia and Angola, they’re “now turning their guns to Botswana,” Chase said. “We have the world’s largest elephant population and it’s open season for poachers,” he told The AP, adding that poachers have targeted old bull elephants that presumably have the heaviest tusks.

Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi, who took office in April, has reportedly taken steps to reduce the use of military weapons against poachers, which some conservationists speculate could be emboldening ivory traffickers.

"Attorney Michael Cohen recorded a conversation with President Trump before the election in which they discussed possible payments to a former Playboy model who claimed she slept with Trump, a source familiar with the investigation confirmed to Fox News.

The source told Fox News that no payment was ever made.

The New York Times first reported that the FBI seized the recording during a raid earlier this year on Cohen’s office as part of an investigation into the former Trump lawyer's payments to women to shut down stories about his client leading up to the 2016 election -- a practice known as “catch-and-kill.”

Fox News has confirmed the details of the tape.

The conversation is said to involve a possible payment to Karen McDougal, who claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006, and took place two months before the election.

The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2016 that McDougal was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc. -- the parent company to the National Enquirer -- for the rights to the story, but it never ran. McDougal has sued AMI, alleging Cohen was secretly involved in those discussions. The lawsuit was settled in April.



Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told The Times that while there was a discussion, the payment was never made and the tape showed that Trump had done nothing wrong.



“Nothing in that conversation suggests that he had any knowledge of it in advance,” Giuliani told The Times. He also said that Trump told Cohen that any payment should be by check, not cash, so it could be documented properly.

“In the big scheme of things, it’s powerful exculpatory evidence,” he said.

Part of the investigation into Cohen involves the $130,000 “hush money” payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election in exchange for her silence about an alleged one-time sexual encounter with Trump. Trump has denied any affair with either Daniels or McDougal.

Speculation has been widespread about what the investigation into Cohen could potentially provide for FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and allegations of collusion with the Trump campaign.

COHEN DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM TRUMP, SAYS FAMILY HAS 'FIRST LOYALTY'

Earlier this month, Cohen distanced himself from the president, saying his family had his ""first loyalty.""

“My wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will,” Cohen told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. “I put family and country first.”

""I will not be a punching bag as part of anyone's defense strategy,"" Cohen later said. ""I am not a villain of this story, and I will not allow others to try to depict me that way.""

"The Democratic Party on Friday filed a multimillion-dollar federal lawsuit against Trump campaign officials, the Russian government and WikiLeaks alleging a widespread conspiracy to tilt the 2016 election in Donald Trump's favor.

Calling it an “all-out assault on our democracy,” the Democratic National Committee filed the civil suit in federal district court in Manhattan. The suit amounts to another legal broadside related to the 2016 race, on top of the special counsel's ongoing Russia probe and the FBI raid on Trump's personal attorney last week.

""The conspiracy constituted an act of previously unimaginable treachery: the campaign of the presidential nominee of a major party in league with a hostile foreign power to bolster its own chance to win the Presidency,"" the suit states.

President Trump fired back hours later via Twitter, calling the suit ""good news.""

Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats,"" he tweeted. ""This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.""

'During the 2016 presidential campaign, Russia launched an all-out assault on our democracy, and it found a willing and active partner in Donald Trump's campaign.' - DNC Chairman Tom Perez

The new suit claims that Trump campaign officials worked in tandem with the Russian government and its military spy agency to bring down Hillary Clinton by hacking into the computer networks of the DNC and spreading stolen material.

“During the 2016 presidential campaign, Russia launched an all-out assault on our democracy, and it found a willing and active partner in Donald Trump’s campaign,” said DNC Chairman Tom Perez in a statement, calling the alleged collusion “an act of unprecedented treachery.”

The suit names several Trump campaign aides who met with Russian nationals during the campaign, including son-in-law Jared Kushner, campaign chair Paul Manafort and campaign deputy Rick Gates.

“In the Trump campaign, Russia found a willing and active partner,” the suit claims. “In 2016, individuals tied to the Kremlin notified the Trump campaign that Russia intended to interfere with our democracy. Through multiple meetings, emails, and other communications, these Russian agents made clear that their government supported Trump and was prepared to use stolen emails and other information to damage his opponent and the Democratic Party.”

Gates and Manafort have both been charged in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The suit also claims Wikileaks founder Julian Assange “shared the defendants’ common goal of damaging the Democratic Party in advance of the election.” The suit states Russia, using WikiLeaks, would disseminate information stolen from the DNC “at times when it would best suit the Trump campaign.”

Brad Parscale, campaign manager of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., slammed the suit as “frivolous” and predicted it would eventually be dismissed.

“This is a sham lawsuit about a bogus Russian collusion claim filed by a desperate, dysfunctional, and nearly insolvent Democratic Party,” Parscale said in a written statement. “With the Democrats’ conspiracy theories against the President’s campaign evaporating as quickly as the failing DNC’s fundraising, they’ve sunk to a new low to raise money, especially among small donors who have abandoned them.”

Trump has strongly – and repeatedly – denied colluding with the Russians.

Most recently, he cited the newly released memos from former FBI boss James Comey to assert his innocence and decry the Russia probe itself.

""James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?"" he tweeted.

While the FBI recently raided Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen’s home, office and hotel room to seize a collection of documents, a source said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein assured that Trump was not a target of that probe.

Trump’s legal team, meanwhile, is expanding with the addition of former federal prosecutor and New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is vowing to seek a swift resolution to the special counsel probe.

As for the latest court action, suing a foreign country could be difficult for Democrats because typically, other nations have immunity from most U.S. lawsuits. However, the suit argues that Russia shouldn’t be entitled to sovereign immunity because the “DNC claims arise out of Russia’s trespass on to the DNC’s private servers … in order to steal trade secrets and commit economic espionage.”

The Democratic Party used a similar tactic during the Watergate scandal in 1972. The DNC sued former President Richard Nixon’s reelection committee for $1 million in damages for the bungled burglary at the Democratic headquarters in the Watergate building.

Former DNC chair Lawrence O’Brien reached a $750,000 settlement from the Nixon campaign on the day Nixon left office.",politics
"U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., apparently has no regrets about his role in the release of the so-called Steele dossier, which is said to contain salacious allegations about then-candidate Donald Trump.

In excerpts of his forthcoming book, “The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other Appreciations,” the 81-year-old senator – who is recuperating at home following recent cancer treatment and surgery – acknowledges that he delivered the information to then-FBI Director James Comey.

“(A)nd I would do it again,” McCain writes, according to excerpts published by the Guardian.

“Anyone who doesn’t like it can go to hell,” McCain adds, saying he did “what duty demanded I do.”

The “disturbing” nature of the allegations against Trump prompted his action, McCain writes.

“I had no idea which if any were true,” the senator writes. “I could not independently verify any of it, and so I did what any American who cares about our nation’s security should have done.”

“I could not independently verify any of it, and so I did what any American who cares about our nation’s security should have done.” - U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., writing in ""The Restless Wave""

In December, Fox News reported that former British spy Christopher Steele instructed Sir Andrew Wood – a former British ambassador to Russia – to approach McCain about the existence of the dossier while Wood and McCain were both attending a security conference in Canada.

McCain later received hard copies of the dossier from Fusion GPS, and relayed a copy to the FBI, Fox News reported.

Also in the excerpts that appear in the Guardian:

McCain claims Republicans are on the “wrong side” of the immigration debate, arguing that it has been driven by “zealots” who fail to understand immigration’s key role in “America exceptionalism.”

The anti-immigration zealots “need to be confronted before their noxious views spread further and damage for generations the reputation of the Republican Party,” McCain writes, according to the Guardian.

McCain also expresses regret for choosing Sarah Palin as his running mate in 2008, instead of his friend, former U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.

"President Trump threatened Google in an early Tuesday morning tweet, saying the Internet giant’s search engine is biased against conservative media and promised that the situation “will be addressed.”

“Google search results for “Trump News” shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal?” Trump wrote in a tweet.

“96% of results on “Trump News” are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!” he added.

Google, however, pushed back and denied ranking results to ""manipulate"" political sentiment.

""When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. ""Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology. Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.""

This is the first time Trump raised the issue of Google search engine’s alleged bias. Just weeks ago Trump attacked other tech giants such as Twitter and Facebook for silencing non-left wing voices, saying “too many voices are being destroyed” and pledged to address the problem as well.

Facebook and Twitter have been under fire for allegedly censoring conservative and Republican accounts on their platforms, while taking a more lenient approach to liberal and left-wing users.

The president previously pointed out to the problem of so-called “shadow banning” on social media platforms, where users while technically not banned but their posts aren’t visible to most users, saying the practice was “discriminatory and illegal.”

TRUMP SAYS ‘TOO MANY VOCIES ARE BEING DESTROYED’ BY SOCIAL MEDIA CENSORSHIP

Earlier this summer, California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes said Google and other tech giants could face hearings over alleged anti-conservative bias.

“I think what the American people need to understand is there is bias against conservatives and Republicans all across this country,” he said during an interview on Fox Business. “And now as you see things, it’s always been there with newspapers and television, but now as you see it getting into the internet it's one of the challenges we have with millennials.”

His remarks came after Google came under fire for inadvertently listed “Nazism” as one of the ideologies of the California Republican party. Google immediately fixed the issue after widespread criticism and blamed the search result on “vandalism” on one of its sources.

"One of the most highly talked about cases of the year is taking place inside Judge T.S. Ellis’ courtroom – and he's making sure Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team knows it.

Mueller’s team has leveled multiple charges of tax and bank fraud against Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign manager, particularly pertaining to his political work in Ukraine.

But while Manafort is the one on trial, the prosecution has often been on the receiving end of Ellis’ rebukes. The judge has lashed out at them for a variety of alleged missteps, from how they address him to how they’ve sought to portray the defendant.

Ellis has also cautioned the team about the high bar set for conviction; prosecutors have to prove Manafort knowingly violated bank and tax laws related to his political work overseas.

Here’s a look at some of the more colorful comments Ellis has directed toward Mueller’s team and key witnesses.

Crying prosecutor?

Ellis seemed to suggest a prosecutor was so discouraged he was crying in his courtroom.

“I understand how frustrated you are. In fact, there’s tears in your eyes right now,” Ellis said Monday, according to a Bloomberg-obtained transcript.

When the prosecutor, Greg Andres, denied Ellis’ claim, the judge said, “Well, they’re watery.”

EVERYTHING TO KNOW ABOUT MUELLER’S RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

Before the exchange, Ellis had rebuked Andres for not looking at him while he was talking.

“Look at me! Don’t look down,” Ellis said.

When Andres said he was looking at a document, Ellis said “that’s B.S.”

And on Wednesday, Ellis chastised Andres again for how he speaks to him. At one point, Andres responded with a simple “yea.”

“Be careful about that, this is not an informal proceeding,” Ellis warned.

‘You don’t really care about Mr. Manafort’

In May, Ellis accused Mueller’s team of caring more about a Trump impeachment than prosecuting Manafort for alleged crimes. He also suggested the team was seeking “unfettered power” in its investigation.

“You don’t really care about Mr. Manafort,” Ellis said during the preliminary hearing. “You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever.”

Ellis also questioned the scope of the investigation, saying, “We don’t want anyone with unfettered power.”

HERE’S WHO HAS BEEN CHARGED IN MUELLER’S RUSSIA PROBE SO FAR

“You don’t really care about Mr. Manafort. You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever.” - Judge T.S. Ellis

Mueller’s team said its authorities are laid out in documents, including the August 2017 scope memo, and some powers are secret because they involve ongoing investigations and national security matters.

But Ellis summed up the argument of the special counsel’s office: “We said this is what the investigation was about. But we’re not going to be bound by it.”

Undermining star witness testimony

Even Rick Gates, Manafort’s former business associate and star witness for the prosecution, hasn’t been able to escape Ellis’ retorts.

During the trial, Gates testified that Manafort “was good at knowing where the money was and how to spend it.”

Ellis interjected, saying, “he wasn’t that great at it” if Gates was able to steal money from Manafort without him noticing.

Gates has testified he embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from Manafort when he was working for him. He said the extra cash was used for “bonus money” and “family money” to pay off an American Express credit card – without Manafort’s knowledge.

RICK GATES RETURNS TO STAND AS ANGRY JUDGE LASHES OUT AT PROSECUTORS

Mueller dropped numerous bank and tax fraud charges against Gates after he struck a plea deal and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.

Prosecutors earlier had suggested they might not call Gates to the stand, but Ellis told them they “can’t prove conspiracy without him.”

‘We don’t convict people because they have money’

Ellis has repeatedly rebuffed Mueller’s team as they sought to present evidence for the jury regarding Manafort’s wealth and “lavish lifestyle” – particularly photos of his closet, showcasing his expensive clothes.

“To parade all this again seems to be unnecessary, irrelevant and may be unfairly prejudicial,” Ellis said.

“Mr. Manafort is not on trial for having a lavish lifestyle, but for not reporting income on his taxes,” Ellis also told prosecutors.

A LOOK AT TS ELLIS, THE JUDGE IN THE MANAFORT, MUELLER CASE

He said the photos would seem “unnecessary, irrelevant” and potentially “prejudicial.”

“Enough is enough. We don’t convict people because they have a lot of money and throw it around,” he said.

Watch your language

Ellis put a lid on the use of the word “oligarch” by prosecutors to describe the wealthy Ukrainians Manafort associated with in his business dealings. He said the word has “pejorative” meaning that isn’t relevant for this particular case.

Ellis said the word could also make it seem as though Manafort has associated with bad people – and make him seem guilty by association.

“It’s not the American way,” he said.

‘They made a mistake when they confirmed me’

Ellis told lawyers on both sides that judges should have patience – only he doesn't.

“Judges should be patient. They made a mistake when they confirmed me. I am not patient,” Ellis said.

He made the remark as he cautioned the attorneys against spending too much time arguing over evidence a witness would be asked about.

"Michael Cohen could face new professional and legal challenges for leaking a secretly recorded conversation with his former client Donald Trump -- a risky move that could cause problems with the state bar, future clients and even investigators.

Cohen, who served as a Trump Organization attorney for more than a decade and has described himself as President Trump’s “fixer,” has sought to distance himself from his client and close friend in recent weeks—though the leak drew the starkest line in the sand between the two.

This week, Cohen’s attorney, Clinton confidant Lanny Davis, released to CNN the tape which had a recording of a discussion between Trump and Cohen about potentially buying the rights to Playboy model Karen McDougal’s story claiming an affair with Trump.

Cohen reportedly has felt hung out to dry by the president, and this was part of his attempt to punch back.

But the move could cause problems for Cohen beyond the president's angry tweets, as experts raise questions of ethical violations.

“He is increasing the amount of baggage associated with his credibility by the day,” white-collar criminal defense attorney for Ifrah Law and former DOJ official Jim Trusty told Fox News.

The president and his legal team were put on defense by the release of the tape, as they scrambled to claim the garbled conversation did not -- as some suggested -- show Trump discussing a cash payoff. But Trump's team also fired back by hammering Cohen for recording the conversation without Trump’s consent. The president, on Wednesday, tweeted: “What kind of lawyer would tape a client? So sad!”

GIULIANI BLASTS COHEN AND DAVIS FOR LEAKING TRUMP TAPE: 'SO MUCH FOR ETHICS!'

Trusty told Fox News it is indeed “unheard of” for an attorney to record a client without the client’s permission -- and questioned whether Cohen would be able to get future clients after this.

“It raises gigantic issues as to the ethics of it, and as a practical matter, whether any client is going to walk in that door after knowing Cohen surreptitiously recorded his biggest client,” Trusty said, noting that Cohen “betrayed” Trump.

Trusty speculated that Cohen’s decision to record Trump could “somehow be an insurance policy” to “protect himself should he find himself in harm’s way.”

“Whether it actually serves that purpose is a totally different question,” Trusty said.

Richard Painter, who was White House ethics counsel for former President George W. Bush, also told Fox News “there are two areas where Cohen has exposure to disciplinary action by the bar.”

Painter cited New York Bar Association Rule 1.2 D, which states that “a lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage or assist a client in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent.”

“The conduct in question is likely to be illegal because of federal election law,” Painter said, noting that a hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in the weeks leading up to the election and a proposed payment to buy the rights to McDougal’s story could be illegal, if not filed properly under campaign finance law.

Trump's legal team says no such payment was ever made for McDougal's story. Further, Cohen reportedly told a CNN anchor that the Daniels payment was for Trump and not the campaign, according to another leaked tape.

But Painter said Cohen was “leading his client [Trump] into a potential crime” by not telling him he would be responsible for disclosing the payment.

“Reputable lawyers aren’t going to get involved in a situation when they’re making payoffs to porn stars and playboys,” Painter said. “A lawyer should say ‘you can’t do this.’”

Painter added: “Instead, what Cohen does is he assists it, facilitates it, and encourages it. But then tapes it without Trump’s consent. I don’t know why a lawyer would do that unless to have something over the client.”

Painter also said Cohen could be in violation of bar Rule 1.6, which cites the “fundamental duty of a lawyer not to reveal information gained during and relating to the representation of a client without the client’s informed consent.”

The rule also “prohibits the lawyer from using confidential information” to the advantage of the lawyer or to the disadvantage of the client.

Painter said Cohen’s leak of the conversation is “very problematic” unless he was working to prevent a crime.

“On both counts, he’s got some serious problems. And he’s got other problems too,” Painter said. “There is a reason his office was raided.”

Earlier this year, federal investigators raided Cohen’s personal properties as part of a criminal investigation and grand jury probe into his personal business dealings.

Painter also noted that if Cohen pleads guilty to any felony in that case, he would be automatically disbarred.

Trump lawyer Rudy Giualiani suggested to the Washington Examiner that Cohen could face professional discipline over the tapes.

“I don’t think we have to do anything about that,” Giuliani said. “I think the bar association will.”

The New York court system's grievance committee, which oversees attorney conduct, declined to comment to Fox News for this story.

Cohen’s attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment, but adamantly defended Cohen earlier this week on CNN.

""This is about honesty versus false disparagement of Michael Cohen,"" he told CNN, claiming the Trump legal team fears his client because he ""has the truth about Donald Trump.""

The Washington Post also noted the release of the audio could rankle investigators, and cause difficulty in striking any potential deal.",politics
"Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on his nomination to the Supreme Court was set for its second day Wednesday, after the unhinged left was on full display on the opening day Tuesday.

Partisan rancor reigned as outbursts, interruptions, protests, and juvenile political stunts broke out when opponents of the nomination attempted to highjack the day’s proceedings.

Each Trump-hating Democrat on the committee took his or her turn flaunting the left’s radical anti-freedom agenda, as the American people got a glimpse of what life would look like if Democrats were entrusted with control of government.

By contrast, Kavanaugh delivered an opening statement that emphasized he would judge cases fairly and without political influence.

“My judicial philosophy is straightforward,” Kavanaugh said. “A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. A judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.”

“The Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution,” Kavanaugh added.

Halloween might not be until next month, but rest assured if Tuesday was any indicator, every scare tactic in the book will be employed this week by the frightening liberals.

Unsurprisingly, committee Democrats began their rigged obstruction charade by asking for delays and requesting more documents to review. As everyone knows, these tactics are illegitimate stunts, because the Democrats have already tipped their hands.

The Democrats on the committee are all going to vote against Kavanaugh’s confirmation, and in large part have already publicly stated as much. If there was a chance at changing minds and getting to “yes,” that might be a reason to look at more records from Kavanaugh’s esteemed career – but that’s a pipe dream.

The crazed left-wing base and the entrenched D.C. special interests driving this insanity won’t permit such open-mindedness. Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, did a great job showing fairness but not giving in to the left’s overt acts of obstruction.

Reasonable American voters are keeping score. They will not forget this disgraceful sideshow any time soon, but career Democratic Party politicians and the purveyors of their far left ideology are too far gone to care what anyone thinks.

The truth is that President Trump made another outstanding pick for the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh is a supremely qualified jurist who will faithfully interpret the law and defend the Constitution.

Kavanaugh’s years of government service are open to the public and available for inspection by anyone who wishes to learn about his stellar record. Democrats have tried and failed to smear this fine man, but that won’t stop Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California from further politicizing these hearings as an audition for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination contest.

The Democratic machine’s playbook is as well-known as it is stale. Everyone knows what’s going to play out and it’s sad that the American people are going to have to stomach it yet again.

Committee Democrats are going to take turns attacking Kavanaugh for his principled decisions – and in the process highlight their failed agenda for the American people. So if there is an upside to this pathetic display by the liberals, their dangerous agenda will bubble up to the surface for all to take in.

This week Kavanaugh will be ridiculed for supporting the right to robust political speech that is enshrined in the First Amendment. Then his integrity will be questioned for standing tall for the right to keep and bear arms that is protected by the Second Amendment to the Constitution.

Following that, an assault on Kavanaugh will commence in order to grandstand the left’s unflinching addiction to abortion on demand. Soon after, committee Democrats will yell and scream about unchecked executive power and the rule of law, while advocating for President Obama’s unconstitutional DACA program for immigrants brought to America as children and lawless sanctuary cities.

But rest assured, the centerpiece of the Democratic agenda will not be forgotten. Judge Kavanaugh will be peppered with hypotheticals and relentlessly questioned about his views on presidential power and impeachment.

The Democrats will gladly take these hearings into the mud pit and the biased mainstream media will undoubtedly praise them for it.

But I know that Kavanaugh will answer each question honestly and with the wisdom, fortitude, and integrity of someone well-suited to be on the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh deserves robust bipartisan support but the liberal machine is powerful and Senate Democrats are too weak to stand up to it.",politics
"Americans are rightly upset over President Trump’s obsequiousness toward Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. The former KGB agent heads a gangster government, and Mr. Trump should have stood up to him.

On the other hand, Democrats’ moralizing Helsinki hysteria is phony. They’re upset with Mr. Putin’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election because Hillary Clinton lost. When it comes to Russian expansionism in the Western Hemisphere and the Kremlin’s abysmal human-rights record, the American left mostly looks the other way.

Democratic ballyhooing over Mr. Putin’s habit of jailing and sometimes killing his political and media opponents is especially rich. Russia’s longstanding ally Cuba has an even worse civil-liberties record. Yet when President Obama unconditionally reshaped U.S. policy to please Cuban dictator Raúl Castro, his party cheered. Mr. Obama even trotted off to a baseball game in Havana with the Cuban mob boss. Democrats cheered some more.

Advocates of the Obama Cuba policy argue that Havana poses no threat to U.S. interests. But if regional security, stability and economic growth matter, that is demonstrably false. Sixty years after Castro came to power, Cuba, with strong backing from the Kremlin, still underwrites tyranny in Central and South America.

"Three people have been charged in the death of a 68-year-old Missouri woman who “scraped together all she had,"" and retired in the Central American nation of Belize, authorities said Monday.

Two men, both 18, and a 16-year-old minor face murder charges after the body of Sherris Stringham was found Friday near a river in Pomona, about 50 miles from the village of Hopkins where she lived, according to the Associated Press.

The suspects are also from Hopkins.

Stringham, a native of Blue Springs, Mo., was last heard from Aug. 25, and had missed several appointments with friends and her house was found “in disarray” with her wallet empty and car missing, the AP reported.

She was reported missing Aug. 27 and her vehicle was found abandoned several days later hundreds of miles away in the northern Orange Walk District.

No motive was confirmed, but robbery was suspected, the AP reported.

Stringham’s family hired a private investigator to search for her and investigate her case, The Kansas City Star reported. A GoFundMe page was set up to cover their costs.

The page said Stringham had recently retired to Hopkins after two decades of driving a school bus and working at a local grocery store and had “scraped together all she had and bravely struck out and retired to Hopkins.”

"Republicans in deep-blue Massachusetts selected pro-Trump State Rep. Geoff Diehl to take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren in November, setting the stage for a contentious referendum on the first-term senator's national profile as she openly mulls a run for the presidency in 2020.

Diehl triumphed over attorney John Kingston, and Beth Lindstrom, an aide to former Gov. Mitt Romney, with early results showing him with a convincing double-digit lead over his rivals.

Of the three candidates, Diehl had the closest ties to President Donald Trump. Diehl co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign. He was quick to note that despite its liberal reputation, Massachusetts gave Trump one of his most lopsided early primary wins.

Warren, who has served in the Senate since 2013, ran unopposed in Tuesday's Democratic primary. She released ten years worth of tax returns recently, laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run in 2020.

Warren hasn't yet declared her intention to run, saying she's wanted to focus on her reelection first. But she has clearly floated the possibility of pursuing the White House, saying in August she's not afraid to be ""the underdog.""

President Trump repeatedly has unloaded on his prospective rival, saying she lied about having Native American roots to help her legal career and vowing to toss a heritage test at her during a presidential debate.

Fox News has ranked the November race as likely Democrat.

Meanwhile, Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker on Tuesday soundly defeated ultraconservative challenger Scott Lively on his way to seeking a second four-year term in office, overcoming charges that he is too moderate as Republicans seek to maintain their hold on New England's governorships.

He's set to face 47-year-old Ohio native Jay Gonzalez, the Democratic nominee for governor, in November. A former official in the administration of Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick, Gonzales has hammered Baker on the deficiencies in the state's mass transit system and called for stronger protections for immigrants.

'REAL INDIAN' RUNNING AS INDEPENDENT AGAINST WARREN SUES AFTER STATE TELLS HIM TO STOP CALLING HER 'FAKE INDIAN'

But despite Massachusetts' longstanding reputation as a deeply liberal state, Baker commands sky-high approval ratings there and ranks among the nation's most popular governors. He largely ignored Lively, a staunch supporter of President Trump.

Baker credited in part his willingness to work cooperatively with Democratic leaders at the Statehouse. He is a progressive Republican, and supports universal healthcare and greater state investments in transportation and education.

Republicans currently hold the governorships of four out of six states in highly liberal New England, including Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and are looking to grow that number in November.

Also on Tuesday, in a major upset, Boston city councilor Ayanna Pressley defeated 10-term incumbent Rep. Michael Capuano. Pressley, expected to be the first black woman elected to represent Massachusetts in Congress because she's set to run unopposed in November, had the backing of Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

And Rep. Richard Neal defeated Democratic primary challenger Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, an attorney who had hoped to make history herself by becoming the first Muslim elected to Congress from Massachusetts. She backed a proposal to make Medicare available to all Americans regardless of age.

Neal will run unopposed in November.

"As Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing on his nomination to the Supreme Court began Tuesday in the Senate Judiciary Committee, senators were ready to probe his views on issues ranging from abortion to the scope of federal regulation. He will also be asked about issues that have attracted far less attention, but will nonetheless have a profound impact on our legal system.

One of these issues is the influential role of the American Law Institute, a 95-year-old body of 3,000 judges, academics and practicing lawyers. While unknown to the general public, the ALI plays a key role in distilling what the law is on key topics.

The institute’s publication “Restatements of the Law” lays down the principles or ""black letter law"" that judges use as guidance in decisions. The Supreme Court cites the ALI every few weeks, on average, in its decisions.

But in recent years many critics have accused the ALI of creating new law rather than restating it. Among those expressing concern have been two Supreme Court justices.

Just before his death in 2016, Justice Antonin Scalia warned about the ALI’s drift. In the Supreme Court’s Kansas v. Nebraska decision he wrote: “Modern Restatements … are of questionable value, and must be used with caution…. Over time, the Restatements’ authors have abandoned the mission of describing the law, and have chosen instead to set forth their aspirations for what the law ought to be.”

Scalia – joined by Justice Clarence Thomas – warned that the ALI’s effort to restate restitution law was highly flawed. Scalia wrote that such novel views of the law should have “no more weight regarding what the law ought to be than the recommendations of any respected lawyer or scholar.” The justice wrote that no longer can one assume that “a Restatement provision describes rather than revises current law.”

That skepticism about the ALI’s work product has spread to the states. Earlier this year, six governors – from Texas, Maine, South Carolina, Nebraska, Utah and Iowa – sent the ALI a letter warning that the proposed draft “Restatement” article on the law of liability insurance was a usurpation of the lawmaking authority of their state legislatures.

The governors argued that the “Restatement” article could also retard economic development by “creating uncertainty and instability in the liability insurance market.” The governors urged ALI members to revise or rescind the draft “Restatement” article.

One state has gone even further. In July, Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, signed a bill that says ALI’s “Restatement of the Law on liability insurance” “does not constitute the public policy of Ohio.”

Ohio courts were directed to ignore the ALI’s “Restatement” article. No state had ever passed legislation against an ALI “Restatement” in its entirety before.

There are also warning signals that the ALI is imprudently trying to redefine social policy by adopting novel legal rules.

At its annual convention two years ago, ALI leaders proposed adopting a model penal code that would make “affirmative consent” the ALI’s official policy in sexual relations. The move was stymied when key ALI members noted that such a definition would shift the burden of proof to the accused – something at odds with our basic judicial system.

As Ashe Schow wrote in The Washington Examiner in 2016: “The accused would have to prove they had received ‘communicated willingness.’ This would mean that any time someone engages in sexual activity, they not only have to make sure they obtain this specific form of consent, but also proof of this consent.”

Jonathan Macey, a professor at Yale Law School, has long argued that the ALI is structured in such a way as to give a minority of legal activists excessive say in its final work product and to exclude broader views.

Macey argues that without taking seriously input from elected officials, regulators, the business community and consumers, the ALI will drift towards bureaucratic turf-grabbing.

Throughout his dozen years a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Brett Kavanaugh has been a staunch opponent of the excessive power wielded by unelected federal regulatory agencies.

Kavanaugh should be asked during his confirmation hearing whether he shares the view of the late Justice Scalia that the ALI has been overstepping its mandate to clarify the law and is trying to reinvent it instead.",politics

The Latest on the accusation of sex abuse cover-up against Pope Francis (all times local):

4:25 p.m.

The author of the bombshell accusation of sex abuse cover-up against Pope Francis has broken his silence and insisted he didn't act out of revenge or anger but out of love for the Catholic Church.

Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano told Italian journalist Aldo Maria Valli — a Vatican expert with state-run RAI television — that he was ""serene and at peace"" after publishing his declaration on Sunday, albeit saddened by subsequent attempts to undermine his credibility.

In a blog post Wednesday, Valli transcribed what he said was an interview with Vigano, who had consulted with him in the weeks leading up to publication. Another conservative Italian journalist, Marco Tosatti, actually helped Vigano rewrite and edit the 11-page document, and arranged for its publication.

In the interview, Vigano revisits old Vatican controversies that marked his Vatican career.

"The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a weekend attack on Western tourists in the Central Asian nation of Tajikistan that left four people dead, including two U.S. cyclists.

After the crash, the driver and the passengers got out of the vehicle and attacked the tourists with knives, leaving four dead and three injured.

Among the dead were two people from the United States, one from Switzerland and one from the Netherlands. Three others suffered minor injuries. The victims were not immediately identified. Tajikistan’s Interior Ministry said three of the victims died at the scene and one died while being transported to the hospital.

The statement from the jihadi group did not say how many militants took part in the attack. There was no immediate reaction to the ISIS claim from Dushanbe on Tuesday.

Rio de Janeiro's public security secretary said Friday that a rise in killings during police operations was a sign that authorities were more aggressively confronting crime, and not of a worsening situation.

In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Gen. Richard Nunes pushed back against critics who argue that a military intervention is leading to more violence in the city that two years ago hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Nunes said that any analysis had to take into account the level of crime and problems in the police forces when the military was put in charge of security.

""The situation was really bad,"" said Nunes, a Rio native and career Army member who was tapped to lead the state's public security secretariat as part of the intervention.

Brazilian President Michel Temer decreed the intervention in February after muggings and beatings were captured on camera during Rio's world famous Carnival celebrations. From the onset, civil rights groups have criticized the move, fearing it would lead to more violence, particularly in marginalized neighborhoods. Six months in, there are some indications of increasing violence.

Between February and July of this year, there were 736 deaths during police operations compared to 547 during the same period last year, according to state figures.

Nunes lamented the deaths and predicted the numbers would start coming down. However, he said the situation wasn't comparable because a year ago police forces were suffering from underfunding and a lack of motivation, which added to a situation where many criminals groups were operating with few checks.

Retraining, the hiring of some new recruits and cracking down on corruption within police ranks was having a positive impact, he said.

Nunes cited a significant drop in robberies of cargo on long-bed trucks, a persistent problem in the state, as a sign of improvement. He noted that fewer robberies meant less associated crime.

""We now have a much stronger police presence in the streets,"" said Nunes.

Nunes said one of the biggest challenges had been working to find solutions amid large budget deficits. Brazil, with Latin America's largest economy, has struggled to fully emerge from its worst recession in decades. The state of Rio de Janeiro has been particularly hard hit in recent years due to a drop in world oil prices, mismanagement and corruption by previous governors.

Beyond reducing criminality, Nunes said authorities were focused on being ready for October's general election. He said a ""crisis cabinet"" was being formed and that police were being trained to deal with many issues related to voting.

Despite ""realistic optimism"" that the intervention will have positive long-term results, Nunes said it wouldn't make sense for it to continue beyond December, when Temer's term will end. Instead, he said the military would share with the incoming administration what had worked.

Nunes expressed confidence that police would solve the murder of Marielle Franco, a black city councilwoman who along with her driver was gunned down in March. The killing shocked Brazil and led to demonstrations in the United States and several other countries.

Just short of six months since the slaying, however, no one has been charged in her death and the investigation has been plagued by several leaks to local media.

Nunes characterized the crime as political, and said it was clearly committed by highly trained assassins who knew how to cover their tracks. Still, authorities were making good progress, particularly considering they had so little to work with in the beginning.

""I can't give a timeline"" for it being solved, he said.",world
"Two leaders of a fundamentalist group who between them have 29 wives and 160 children were sentenced to house arrest on Tuesday after being convicted of polygamy.

Both face 12 months of probation. Blackmore was also ordered to perform 150 hours of community service work, while Oler must do 75 hours.

""He's made it clear that no sentence will deter him from practicing his faith,"" the judge said of Blackmore. ""The concept of remorse is foreign to him in this context.""

The two men have been leaders in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which believes in plural marriage. They have both been part of the small community of Bountiful, a mountainous region in southeastern British Columbia.

Dozens of Blackmore’s supporters were in court and were upset when the sentence was read.

Blackmore's lawyer had asked the judge to consider all possible sentences in the case, including an absolute discharge. The maximum sentence for polygamy under the region's criminal code is five years in prison.

CLARIFICATION: A previous version of this report referred to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a “Mormon sect.” The group has split from the Mormon church, also known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

"One man is dead and another is injured after they were attacked by a cougar Saturday while mountain biking in Washington State, police said.

King County Sheriff’s spokesman Sgt. Ryan Abbott said the pair, whose identities haven't been released, were attacked while they were going for a mountain bike ride in North Bend, east of Seattle.

It is not clear if the victims were biking together or separately.

The 31-year-old survivor was taken to Harborview medical Center where he remains in serious condition, the hospital said in a statement. He was alert and was heard talking.

The second victim was found dead and, according to Abbott, had not been removed from the scene.

The cougar had been standing over the body of the victim when authorities arrived, KIRO reported.

The Washington Department of Fish and Game was tracking the animal down, which reportedly ran into the woods following the attack.

Police later confirmed that the cougar was found and “euthanized.”

"Two years into the Trump administration, aggrieved activists are not only accosting Cabinet members or driving them out of restaurants -- they're increasingly taking out their frustration on inanimate objects.

A burst of anti-Trump vandalism against possessions and property associated with administration officials is the latest flare-up in a “resistance” that has taken many forms.

Last year, protesters marked the anniversary of President Trump's election by screaming at the sky. Lately, the tactics have become more confrontational, touching off a national debate over civility in politics.

But smashing and spray-painting are yet another outlet. Here are some of the items that have been the focus of anti-Trump activists’ rage.

Trump’s Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame



Trump’s star on the Walk of Fame has been subjected to repeat acts of vandalism, with one protester going so far as to smash it with a pick ax last month.

Brawls have since broken out at the spot after crowds of Trump supporters and protesters gathered near the contentious marker.

But this isn’t the first time the star has been under assault. Back in 2016, before Trump was elected, the star was defaced by a vandal who scratched off his name and a TV icon. The vandal told TMZ he was doing it so that the removed parts could be auctioned for the legal defense of Trump accusers.

Earlier that year, the star was defaced in February of 2016 when someone spray-painted it with a swastika.



Betsy DeVos’ Yacht



A $40 million boat owned by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was untied from its Ohio dock last week, causing it to drift into a dock and incur up to $10,000 in damages. The vessel, named the Seaquest, ended up with large scratches before the crew was able to get control of it.

DeVos is unlikely to be too troubled by the damage -- the Seaquest is one of 10 vessels owned by the DeVos family.



Ben Carson’s House



Ben Carson, the Housing and Urban Development secretary, said in a Facebook post last August that his home in Virginia, along with his neighbor’s house, was vandalized by anti-Trump types who “wrote hateful rhetoric about President Trump.”



“We were out of town, but other kind, embarrassed neighbors cleaned up most of the mess before we returned,” Carson said.



Trump Golf Courses



Of all the officials in the Trump administration, President Trump will always be the main villain in the eyes of his opponents. This, in turn, makes his properties a prime target.



The Trump International Golf Course near his Florida estate was hit by splotches of red paint in April, obscuring some of the letters on the sign at the entrance of the club in West Palm Beach.

In October, a Hawaii man reportedly was charged with criminal mischief for defacing four golf courses owned by the Trump Organization, by allegedly carving messages into the greens.

Trump International Hotel

In October 2016, Trump's hotel in downtown Washington D.C. was vandalized with the phrases ""black lives matter"" and ""no justice, no peace.""

In May 2017, the same hotel briefly had messages in light projected onto the hotel, including one that said ""Pay Trump Bribes Here."" Another read ""emoluments welcome,"" in reference to the controversy surrounding Trump's alleged financial conflicts.

Trump Paraphernalia

Make America Great Again? Well, don't declare it too loudly, as there have been multiple reports of Trump supporters being accosted for wearing a MAGA cap, or other signs of Trump support.

Just this week, a woman in Massachusetts was taken into custody after allegedly deliberately ramming into a car sporting a Trump bumper sticker.

“She said, ‘You voted for Trump?’” the man she hit recalled her saying. “I said yes. She called me a racist and several other names.” The man then claimed that the woman repositioned her vehicle and hit his car with hers, the Cape Cod Times said, citing the police report. After this, the woman reportedly left the scene.

"Michael Cohen's guilty plea, in a matter of hours, has kicked up speculation about Democratic impeachment efforts against President Trump, as lawmakers declare the president is now implicated in a criminal conspiracy.

Former Trump lawyer Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, saying Trump directed hush money to two women who claimed affairs with him.

While the president and his allies deny Trump is in any legal trouble, the controversy raised concerns on the right that Democrats will use the issue to pursue impeachment should they reclaim the House majority.

“The framers of the Constitution provided impeachment as the way to remove an unfit President,” longtime impeachment supporter Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, tweeted on Wednesday. “The ultimate question is, does Congress have the will?”

Top Democratic leaders aren't all following suit. But Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who as ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee would likely play a pivotal role in any impeachment effort, said in a statement that, ""The President of the United States is now directly implicated in a criminal conspiracy.”

He added, ""[T]he Judiciary Committee has real work to do.

""The Congress stands at a crossroads. Democrats are poised to take action to respond to this culture of corruption that has taken hold under Mr. Trump and Republican Congressional Majorities. It is not too late for my Republican colleagues to put our country ahead of their politics and join us in our work.""

Asked about the impeachment talk, Nadler told The New York Times he needs to see more evidence from the special counsel probe, but added, “We may get there.”

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., top Democrat on the oversight committee, also called for a congressional hearing with Cohen.

Other top Democrats have remained quiet on the possibility of pursuing Trump impeachment.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California on Wednesday said that impeaching Trump is ""not a priority"" for her party and that she prefers for Democrats, if they win the House in November, to conduct oversight and ensure Special Counsel Robert Mueller can finish his work.

""[I]mpeachment has to spring from something else,” she told reporters. ""If and when the information emerges about that, we'll see. It's not a priority on the agenda going forward unless something else comes forward.""

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on Wednesday that it is too early to talk about impeachment, but added that the country is on “the verge of constitutional crisis.”

“I think the first conversation is about the seriousness of what happened yesterday,” Durbin said. “We are on the threshold of a constitutional crisis.”

Durbin added: “To have the president’s personal counsel suggest that he was directed by the president to commit an act which led to a plea of guilty ... is a serious allegation.”

Meanwhile, billionaire former hedge fund manager and founder of the group Need to Impeach, Tom Steyer, launched a media blitz following Tuesday’s news. Steyer’s group quickly put out a digital ad about impeaching Trump and is working on a similar ad for television.

“The evidence continues to mount up,” Steyer said in a video. “The question is, when will Congress pay attention?”

Most Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill deflected from answering questions about the possibility of impeachment.

“That is in hands of prosecutor that is working its way through courts,” Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said when questioned if Trump committed a crime by allegedly ordering the hush money to be paid. “They will handle that and prosecutor’s office will handle that if someone is accused of something they have the right to defend themselves.”

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he wouldn’t judge whether Cohen’s implication of Trump in the hush money scandal was more serious than the allegations leveled against former President Bill Clinton that led to his impeachment hearings, but that he doesn’t see impeachment as a serious matter currently.

“Not at this point,” Hatch said. “But we have to take these matters very seriously.”

In regards to the impeachment proceedings brought against Clinton, one longtime Republican senator’s words came back to haunt him on Tuesday.

MSNBC commentator Lawrence O’Donnell posted a video of now-Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., speaking on the floor as one of the prosecutors in the House of Representatives’ case for removing Clinton from office.

“You don’t even have to be convicted of a crime to lose your job in this constitutional republic if this body determines your conduct as a public official is clearly out of bounds in your role,” the then-congressman says in the nearly 20-year-old clip.

“Because impeachment is not about punishment,” he said. “Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.”

The clip quickly spread across social media with Trump critics asking if he still believes in that standard.

In the hours after the news broke about Cohen and ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's conviction, Trump and White House staffers went on the offensive, with Trump slamming Cohen during a speech in West Virginia and tweeting on Wednesday that Cohen ""plead[ed] guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!""

Trump appeared to be referencing that Obama's 2008 campaign was fined $375,000 by the Federal Election Commission for reporting violations that stemmed from missing notices for donations received during the final days of the campaign.

Nearly a dozen people close to the president, including current and former White House aides, told Politico that Tuesday was one of the darkest days of Trump’s presidency and that many are worried the revelations will bolster support for Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.

“There was political momentum building to wrap up the Mueller probe soon,” a former administration official told Politico. “At the very least, in the short term, these two developments will pretty significantly bolster the office of the special counsel and people’s perceptions of it.”

Despite the talk of impeachment, some experts say there is not enough evidence to impeach Trump.

“We’re far away from [an] impeachable offense or a criminal offense on the part of the president,” Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz said.

"With the world’s attention fixed on the horribly violent persecution of Burma's Rohingya Muslims, Christians are also suffering from a less visible but also brutal mistreatment and ethnic cleansing campaign at the hands of the Burmese Army, according to aid agencies, human rights groups and U.S. officials.

The campaign against the Christians, which according to estimates has displaced at least 100,000 people, has also left thousands stranded in the Burmese jungle terrain, either from fleeing heavy bombing, or living in fear of what will come when the current monsoon season ends.

“Christianity is under direct attack by the Burma Army. Christians have repeatedly been singled out for rape, torture, and death over the course of this war, and that trend is continuing,” Ephraim Mattos, East Asia Operations Manager for The Nazarene Fund (TNF), a humanitarian group that works to support the plight of Christians worldwide, told Fox News. “In Burma, if you don’t fall into the category of being Buddhist and ethnic Burmese, then you are considered second-class, and not worthy of the full rights of a citizen.”

Christians in Burma, also known as Myanmar, make up an estimated 8.2 percent of the Buddhist-dominant population - or around four million people. Many of those Christians live in the often undeveloped, neglected periphery states.

Christian groups backed the British against Japanese occupiers during World War II, and were once promised a homeland of their own. But they have instead encountered nearly seven decades of protracted war with the iron-fist Burmese military – suffering significant persecution ranging from rape, murder and forced conversions to labor conscription. They are also being forced to use their own bodies to enter landmine-peppered areas in “clearance” for Burmese troops, according to reports.

The Christians can only wait for what is likely to be an expanding campaign of ethnic and religious purging. The Burmese military operations are carried out like clockwork along the border provinces – moving from the western Rakhine state against the Rohingya up to the Christians and ethnic minority groups in the neighboring fringe state of Chin, around to the northern state of Kachin, down to the southeastern region of Shan, and then further south to the Karen – also called Kayin.

“Today, religious and ethnic persecution continues to take place, both against the Rohingya, but also against Christian religious minorities,” affirmed Olivia Enos, policy analyst for the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation. “Christian Karen, Kachin and in Shan state have largely fallen off of the international community’s radar – but their plight is similarly severe. Kachin, for example, are being virtually collectivized – churches burned, land seized, women raped, and children killed before their very eyes. Not unlike what Rohingya experienced.”

In Kachin state, some 60 churches are reported to have been bulldozed by the Burmese Army in the last five months alone, replaced by Buddhist temples. The Kachin people, who have also endured a decades-long struggle for equal rights and self-determination, have faced an alarming uptick in violence since the start of this year.

Almost 7,000 villages of the Christian stronghold have been upended and just last week, a Burmese army-backed militia allegedly battered two youth pastors with rifle butts after they requested they stop decimating homes.

Then there are the ethnic Karens, whose leadership is mostly Christian, as are large swaths of the group's population.

Mattos said the recent increase in anti-Christian activity prompted the need for TNF to go beyond their fundamental rescue and relief efforts, and prepare the Karen people for “inevitable attacks that are coming.”

“We are creating an early warning communication network in the villages closest to the Burma Army outposts. This allows entire villages to evacuate before the Burma Army arrives, and to coordinate with other entire villages under attack to ensure fleeing civilians are not running in the wrong direction and into a trap,” Mattos explained. “The communications network also allows relief personnel the ability to respond in a timely manner to provide the villages with food, shelter, and safety.”

In early May, the Burmese Army marched in – under the auspices of re-building a strategic road that runs through the heart of Karen land – and heavy fighting subsequently broke out between the military and Karen fighters.

“Even though the Burma Army eventually pulled back their troops in preparation for the June rains, they told the Karen leaders that they will come back,” Mattos said. “It is not a matter of ‘if’ the Burma Army will attack the Karen, but rather ‘when.’ And many predict it will be this fall, when the rainy season ends.”

BURMA'S KAREN REFUGEES FACE DWINDLING AID, STRUGGLE WITH DEPRESSION AND SUICIDES

ARCHAEOLOGISTS FEAR BIBLICAL ARTIFACTS, MONUMENTS WON'T SURVIVE YEMEN WAR

Christians are also tormented in more subtle ways. Saw Kwe Htoo Win, Vice Chairman of the Karen National Union (KNU), noted that even though they are constitutionally now allowed to teach their language and faith in the classroom, the central government brings in educators who are Buddhist, and speak only Burmese, meaning they have to scramble funds to try and keep their religion and ethnic tongue and tradition alive through church classes.

Moreover, District Chairman of the Hpa-an region of Karen state, Padho Aung Maw Aye, told Fox News he knows of cases where Christians in the community had applied to the central government for identification cards, only for the cards to be returned with “Buddhist” listed. After issuing complaints, the recipients were then dismissed and told “you can change it later.”

Nonetheless, Ta Doe Moo, Secretary-General of the KNU, said Christianity is steadily growing in Burma, despite what appears to be an apparent prohibition on private Christian services.

“Around the Yangon city area, we are receiving information that the government is not allowing Christians to hold services in their homes. They can go to church, but leaders have been issued orders not to have religious gatherings at home,” he said.

But bringing to life new churches, Moo said, is a problem because the government denied their requests to build or rebuild. He also said the discussion of faith has become more illuminated inside Burma, too, in recent years.

“It used to be when I was young that whether you were Muslim, Christian or Buddhist, it was never talked about and it didn’t matter,” Moo continued. “Now, that is very different.”

A U.S. State Department religious freedom report, released in late May, said the Burmese government is “doubling down” its campaign against ethnic minorities, and waging a new campaign of brutality against the Christian minority that has left more than 100,000 civilians displaced and trapped amid the hostilities. Late last year, the U.S again designated Burma a “Country of Particular Concern” (CPC) for violating religious freedom.

“The United States calls on all parties in Burma’s internal conflicts, including the military, to end violence and respect and protect the human rights of Burma’s diverse population,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson told Fox News. “We urge the Government of Burma to protect the religious freedom of all people in Burma.”

The U.S Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), an independent federal government commission, issued a more blunt assessment.

“Discrimination and violence against Christians and other religious and ethnic minorities in Burma has been ongoing in the country’s decades-long civil war between the military and several ethnic groups,” said the Vice Chair and Commissioner Gayle Manchin. “After witnessing the large-scale extermination of Rohingya Muslims, other religious and ethnic communities are right to be concerned that Burma’s military may do the same to them, especially since it operates with zero accountability and near total impunity.”

The Myanmar Embassy in Washington and the UN delegation in New York did not respond to multiple requests for an interview and comment on this story. But the government has officially and routinely insisted ceasefire agreements with ethnic minorities are holding, and has denied charges of religious or ethnic persecution.

Burmese officials have claimed they merely responded to Rohingya insurgent attacks on security forces last August, despite claims from State Department investigators that the clampdown was planned months in advance.

In contrast, Christians inside Burma worry that – with little attention from the international community in the dark shadow of the Rohingya tragedy – military rule will operate against them with impunity.

“Very few people are interested in our issue, we are struggling for the support of the people and it is becoming harder and harder to be a minority,” Moo added. “Without support, we cannot sustain in Burma. To the government and military, it is one language, one literacy, one religion.”",world
"A series of cyberattacks sponsored by Chinese government hackers earlier this year infiltrated the computers of a U.S. Navy contractor, allowing a large amount of highly-sensitive data on undersea warfare to reportedly be stolen.

The breaches, which took place in January and February, included leaked plans to develop a supersonic anti-ship missile for use on U.S. Navy submarines, U.S. officials told the Washington Post.

A contractor who works for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Newport, R.I. -- a research and development center for submarines and underwater weaponry -- was the target of the hackers, the Post reported.

While the unnamed officials did not identify the contractor, they told the newspaper that a total of 614 gigabytes of material was taken.

Included in that data was information about a secret project known as Sea Dragon, in addition to signals and sensor data and the Navy submarine development unit’s electronic warfare library. The Washington Post said it agreed to withhold some details of what was stolen at the request of the U.S. Navy over fears it could compromise national security.

A Navy spokesman told Fox News in a statement the service branch will not comment on specific incidents, but cyber threats are ""serious matters"" officials are working to ""continuously"" bolster awareness of.

""There are measures in place that require companies to notify the government when a cyber incident has occurred that has actual or potential adverse effects on their networks that contain controlled unclassified information,"" Cmdr. Bill Speaks said. ""It would be inappropriate to discuss further details at this time.""

Last year, South Korean firms involved in the deployment of the U.S. Army's Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile defense system, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.

""We treat the broader issue of cyber intrusion against our contractors very seriously,"" Speaks told Fox News. ""If such an intrusion were to occur, the appropriate parties would be looking at the specific incident, taking measures to protect current info, and mitigating the impacts that might result from any information that might have been compromised.”

"Boston city councilor Ayanna Pressley unseated 10-term U.S. Rep. Michael Capuano in a Democratic primary Tuesday in the latest shakeup of the House Democratic caucus by a far-left challenger.

Capuano conceded defeat to Pressley in the race to represent Massachusetts' 7th District approximately 30 minutes before The Associated Press formally called the race. With 69 percent of precincts reporting late Tuesday, Pressley had the lead by 10,682 votes.

Pressley, who is running unopposed in November, is set to become the first African-American woman elected to Congress from the Commonwealth.

Capuano is the fourth House member to lose a primary this year, along with Reps. Robert Pittenger, R-N.C.; Mark Sanford, R-S.C., and fellow 10-term Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y.

The prospect of a Pressley upset had drawn some comparisons to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's defeat of Crowley in June. The New York democratic socialist had endorsed Pressley, as did Our Revolution, the offshoot of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign.

However, unlike Crowley, Capuano had fiercely contested the Massachusetts race by racking up endorsements, attending debates and highlighting his consistently liberal voting record in one of the most Democratic districts in a traditionally Democratic state.

And unlike Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old political neophyte, the 44-year-old Pressley has a track record in Massachusetts' halls of power. She served as former Secretary of State John Kerry's political director when he was a U.S. senator and became the first black woman elected to the Boston City Council in 2009.

Greeting voters at a Boston polling station earlier Tuesday, Pressley spoke of ""the ground shifting beneath our feet and the wind at our backs.""

""This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy,"" she told reporters. ""This is a disruptive candidacy, a grassroots coalition. It is broad and diverse and deep. People of every walk of life.""

Pressley has backed Medicare-for-all and called for defunding Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

She likely was aided by the demographics of the 7th district, which cuts a north-south swathe through the city of Boston and includes portions of neighboring Chelsea, Everett, Randolph, Milton and Somerville -- where Capuano served as mayor for nine years in the 1990s.

PRO-TRUMP REPUBLICAN WINS PRIMARY TO TAKE ON SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN

State lawmakers designated the district as the first majority-minority district in Massachusetts. Just a third of the population is white, with blacks, Hispanics and Asians constituting most of the other two-thirds.

However, Pressley had bristled at the notion that race was a defining issue in her campaign.

""I have been really furious about the constant charges being lobbed against me about identity politics that, by the way, are only lobbed against women and candidates of color,"" she said in one debate. ""I happen to be black and a woman and unapologetically proud to be both, but that is not the totality of my identity.""

The contest also formed sharp divides among Boston's Democratic political and media elite. The city's mayor, Marty Walsh, campaigned with Capuano in the final days of the race. U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy, a grandson of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, also endorsed the incumbent, calling him ""a guy who won't shy away from steep odds or tough truths.""

OPINION: IS THIS WOMAN THE GOP'S OCASIO-CORTEZ?

Pressley was backed by state Attorney General Maura Healey, who repeatedly has challenged the Trump administration's policies on on immigration, gun control and other issues. She also was endorsed by The Boston Globe, which called her ""the future of the Democratic Party.""

The last time an incumbent Democratic House member in Massachusetts lost a primary was in 2014, when Seth Moulton defeated former Rep. John Tierney, who brought significant personal baggage to the campaign.

"The liberal news media have a new favorite word to use when discussing President Trump: impeachment.

For example, MSNBC and CNN reporters, anchors and guests said “impeach,” “impeachment” or some other form of the word on the cable news channels an incredible 222 times between 6 a.m. and 11:59 p.m. Wednesday. And of course, they talked about possible impeachment other days as well, and newspapers and websites were also filled with impeachment speculation.

Most Democrats in Congress and their leaders are shying away from talking about impeachment before the November midterm elections – but that’s not stopping the anti-Trump media.

In the discussions about kicking the duly elected president of the United States out of office, speakers gave their fond recollections of the effort to impeach President Nixon, which resulted in his resignation on Aug. 9, 1974.

Journalists and the people they interviewed fondly recalled the Nixon drama, talked about the how you can’t spell “election” without an “I,” and warned the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh will face fierce opposition from Democrats.

Journalists were so desperate for the narrative that they completely ignored correcting a false statement they had promoted for nearly a half-hour across the three broadcast networks. ABC, CBS and NBC first reported that “Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting” with Russians. Then when former Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, corrected the record the media ignored it for an entire day.

Facts apparently don’t matter. MSNBC did a number on accuracy and ran an incorrect graphic of “how impeachment works” two days in a row. Perhaps it was just wishful thinking as the left-wing network hoped that 60 senators could convict the president instead of the required 67.

Slate flashed back to the impeachment drama it enjoyed (hint: not the one involving President Clinton.) “Most of the articles of impeachment against Nixon could easily apply to Trump,” it reported.

Journalists couldn’t control themselves. NBC’s “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie was enthralled talking to “Meet The Press” host Chuck Todd about possible impeachment.

“So is this gonna, in some way, be like the only issue in the midterms going forward?” Guthrie asked.

“I think it’s possible,” Todd said.

Oddly, CNN’s Ana Cabrera and sometime-conservative host S.E. Cupp accused the White House of the “politics of fear” over that same possibility of impeachment. Cupp stressed that saying what her network is saying is “stoking these fears” that the Democrats will impeach. She claimed it’s a voter “turnout” strategy.

Apparently, she never watches her own network. But who can blame her?

There’s one fly in the ointment. Democrats are afraid that rational Americans don’t want to impeach a president for something he might have done that they don’t care about and happened before he ever took office. The party fears such impeachment talk might help the GOP.

The issue Democrats want to flee is the top agenda item of liberal billionaire Tom Steyer. And at least part of his wish came true – the part he’s paying $120 million to get – turning the election into a referendum on impeaching the president.

Steyer, whose record of picking winning candidates in elections is atrocious, wants to impeach President Trump and replace him. Possibly with himself. He’s already built a list of 5.5 million impeachment fans and the former hedge fund executive is “seriously looking into running for president,” according to CNBC.

So the news media aren’t just buying into a bogus exercise in impeachment, they are genuinely doing the work of a likely Democratic candidate.

It showed aerial footage from a Texas Department of Public Safety helicopter. SWAT officers from the Austin Police Department are seen following Mark Anthony Conditt, as he drove a car along Interstate 35 on March 21. The vehicle pursuit ended as two vans close in and stop the 23-year-old's vehicle. Officers were seen rushing over to the Conditt's car before an explosion occurs.

“Got an explosion! Got an explosion inside the vehicle,” an officer was heard saying.

Ten days later, a second ""porch bombing"" occurred, killing 17-year-old Draylen Mason and injuring the teen's mother. A third bomb went off on March 12, injuring Esperanza Herrera, 75. After this incident, police said all three bombings were connected.

"Pope Francis told reporters Sunday that he ""won't say a word"" about claims by a former Vatican ambassador to the U.S. that the pontiff had rehabilitated the former archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick, despite being made aware of sexual misconduct claims against him.

In an 11-page memo made public Saturday evening, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò called on Francis to resign over his handling of the McCarrick matter. The most eye-opening claim by Viganò was that Pope Benedict XVI had sanctioned McCarrick in 2009 or 2010 -- in essence prohibiting him from public ministry and ordering him to carry out a life of prayer and penance -- only for Francis to re-instate him, ""cover"" for him and advance him to the role of a ""trusted counselor.""

Returning to Rome from a two-day visit to Ireland, Francis said that he had read Viganò's memo and thought it ""speaks for itself.""

Francis accepted McCarrick's resignation as cardinal last month, after a U.S. church investigation determined that an accusation he had sexually abused a minor was credible.

FORMER VATICAN DIPLOMAT CALLS FOR POPE FRANCIS TO RESIGN, SAYS HE IGNORED SEX ABUSE ALLEGATIONS

Since then, another man has come forward to say McCarrick began molesting him starting when he was 11, and several former seminarians have said McCarrick abused and harassed them when they were in seminary. The accusations have created a crisis of confidence in the U.S. and Vatican hierarchy, because it was apparently an open secret that McCarrick regularly invited seminarians to his New Jersey beach house, and into his bed.

Coupled with the devastating allegations of sex abuse and cover-up in a recent Pennsylvania grand jury report — which found that 300 priests had abused more than 1,000 children over 70 years in six dioceses — the scandal has led to calls for heads to roll and for a full Vatican investigation into who knew what and when about McCarrick.

Viganò, the papal ambassador -- or nuncio -- to Washington between 2011 and 2016, identified the Vatican cardinals and U.S. archbishops who were informed about the McCarrick affair by name, an unthinkable expose for a Vatican diplomat to make. He said documents backing up his version of events are in Vatican archives.

He said Francis asked him about McCarrick when they met on June 23, 2013, at the Vatican's Santa Marta hotel where the pope lives, three months after Francis was elected pope.

Viganò wrote that he told Francis: ""Holy Father, I don't know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation of Bishops, there is a dossier this thick about him. He corrupted generations of seminarians and priests, and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.""

Soon thereafter, Viganò wrote, he was surprised to find that McCarrick had started traveling on missions on behalf of the church, including to China. McCarrick was also one of the Vatican's intermediaries in the U.S.-Cuba talks in 2014.

Viganò's claim that McCarrick had been ordered by Benedict to stay out of public ministry and retire to a lifetime of prayer is somewhat disputed, given that McCarrick enjoyed a fairly public retirement. Viganò provides no evidence that such sanctions were imposed by Benedict, saying only that he was told they were.

Viganò, however, also has had his own problems with allegations of cover-up, and he and Francis had a major dust-up during Francis' 2015 visit to the U.S., which Viganò organized.

In that incident, a leading U.S. opponent of gay marriage, Kim Davis, was among those invited to meet with the pope at Viganò's Washington residence. Francis was so enraged that Davis' supporters had leaked word of the meeting that the Vatican subsequently insisted he only held one private audience while there: with one of his former students, a gay man and his partner.

The cover-up accusation, which Viganò denied, concerned allegations that he tried to quash an investigation into the former archbishop of St. Paul-Minneapolis, Minn., John Nienstedt, who was accused of misconduct with adult seminarians.

In 2016, the National Catholic Reporter said Viganò allegedly ordered the investigation wrapped up and a piece of evidence destroyed. The report cited a 2014 memo from a diocesan official that was unsealed following the conclusion of a criminal investigation into the archdiocese. No charges were filed.

In a statement provided to the Associated Press Sunday about the Nienstedt case, Viganò said a Vatican investigation of the allegation found no wrongdoing on his part.

He said the allegation that he destroyed evidence was false and that his efforts to have the archdiocese correct the record have been met with silence.

Nienstedt was forced to resign in 2015 over complaints about his handling of sex abuse cases.

Viganò's name also made headlines during the 2012 ""Vatileaks"" scandal, when some of his letters were published. In them, he begged not to be transferred to the Vatican embassy in Washington from the administration of the Vatican City State.

He claimed he was being punished for having exposed corruption in the Vatican. The letters showed a clash with Benedict's No. 2, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who is also a target of his McCarrick missive.

The document's authenticity was confirmed to The Associated Press by an Italian journalist, Marco Tosatti, who said he was with Viganò when the archbishop wrote it Wednesday.

""He was very emotional and upset at the end the effort,"" Tosatti told AP, adding that Viganò left Tosatti's home afterward without saying where he was going.

"Hours before Sen. John McCain died on Saturday, a Republican seeking Arizona’s other U.S. Senate seat suggested that his family’s earlier announcement that he was ending cancer treatment had been timed to hurt her campaign.

Former State Sen. Kelli Ward, who lost a primary to McCain running from the right in 2016 and is now trying to win the GOP nomination for retiring Sen. Jeff Flake’s seat, made the suggestion in response to a Facebook post by a campaign aide.

According to screenshots of the conversation posted on Twitter by Arizona political reporters, the aide, Jonathan Williams, wondered if it was “just a coincidence” that the announcement of McCain ending medical treatment came the day Ward was launching a statewide bus tour, her big push before Tuesday’s primary.

Ward replied: “I think they wanted to have a particular narrative that is negative to me.”

After her response was Tweeted out, Ward deleted the post and replaced it with one claiming the media was concocting a story.

Aaron Borders, an Arizona lobbyist and ex-vice chair of the Maricopa County GOP, shared the comment on his Facebook page told The Washington Post that Ward, “shouldn’t be saying any of this. Leave it alone. [McCain’s] not even an opponent. That’s about as narcissistic as it gets,”

“I’ve said again and again to pray for Senator McCain & his family,” Ward wrote. “These decisions are terrible to have to make. I feel compassion for him and his family as they go through this.”

McCain, a war hero who survived five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, served three decades in Congress and went on to become the Republican Party’s nominee for president in 2008, died Saturday. He was 81 years old.

State Sen. Phil Williams, a Republican from Rainbow City, Ala., tweeted his invitation Thursday night.

""Hey #InNOutBurger c'mon to Alabama! We love burgers, and we love #Republicans! #alpolitics,"" Williams tweeted.

In-N-Out reportedly donated $25,000 to the California Republican Party earlier this week, and the revelation has caused many who identify as Democrats — or just not Republican — to demand a boycott of the chain.

""Tens of thousands of dollars donated to the California Republican Party ... it's time to #BoycottInNOut - let Trump and his cronies support these creeps... perhaps animal style!"" Eric Bauman, chairman of the California Democratic Party, tweeted Thursday.

This is not the first time In-N-Out has donated to the GOP. In 2016 and 2017, the company donated $30,000 to the Republican Party for general expenses, Los Angeles magazine reported.

"The United States shot down an Arab-backed resolution on Friday that condemned Israel’s use of force in Gaza while calling for the protection of Palestinian civilians, instead authoring a proposal that omitted its ally’s involvement in the region.

The initial vote was on a resolution, drafted by Kuwait, which called for the secretary-general to propose ways to ensure “international protection” for Palestinians civilians and demanded that Israel’s military cease any “use of excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force.”

The U.N. Security Council vetoed the proposal – something the U.S. committed to doing ahead of Friday’s vote.

“It is resolutions like this one that undermine the U.N.’s credibility in dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said, speaking of the proposal's omission of Hamas.

She called it ""grossly one-sided"" in not mentioning Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza.

""The resolution places all blame on Israel"" and ""is wildly inaccurate,"" Haley said.

The U.S. authored its own proposal condemning Hamas over the recent escalation of violence and demanded a stop to “all violent activity and proactive acts” in Gaza. It made no mention of Israel’s military action, or of protection of Palestinian citizens.

The council vetoed the resolution – with the U.S. being the only yes vote.

In two months of mass protests at the Gaza border, over 115 Palestinians have been killed and thousands wounded by Israeli military fire. Israel says its troops were defending its border and accused Hamas of trying to attack under the cover of the protest.

"A top Tennessee Democratic Party’s communications official made disparaging comments about President Donald Trump and lashed out against a suggestion to reach out to his voters, describing them as “idiots.”

Mark Brown, a top communications official for the Tennessee Democratic Party currently working as the leading spokesperson to help Democrat Phil Bredesen win the Senate race against Republican Marsha Blackburn, has made a number over-the-top comments on social media, including calling the president “f---stik” and “Putin’s b----,” the Washington Free Beacon revealed.

“Exactly, f--- ‘reaching out’ to Trump voters. The idiots aren't listening,” Brown wrote in one of the tweets from 2017. In other tweets he also called Trump a “f---ing moron” and “insane f---.”

The revelations Brown’s troubling remarks on social media came as Bredesen complained about Vice President Mike Pence's “name-calling” after he endorsed his Republican opponent and called him a liberal.

“We need @VoteMarsha in the Senate. If Marsha Blackburn’s opponent wins, Tennessee will have a liberal in the Senate who supports single-payer health care and wants to repeal our tax cuts, which he called ‘crumbs.’ He’s too liberal for Tennessee,” wrote Pence on Twitter earlier this month.

Brown’s online comments about ignoring Trump voters may hurt the party’s Senate candidate in the state, who promised to go beyond party lines and work with everyone, as Trump won Tennessee by 26 points.

Scott Golden, the chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, told the Free Beacon that the “hateful comments” from the Democratic Party’s official were “reprehensible” and called him a “professional Twitter troll” who just said what his party thinks about Trump.

"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz confirmed Tuesday that he is investigating whether FBI official Peter Strzok’s anti-Trump bias factored into the launch of the bureau’s Russia probe.

During a joint hearing before the House Oversight and Judiciary committees, Horowitz testified that his office was reviewing Strzok’s anti-Trump text messages as part of a separate probe related to the Russia investigation.

“It clearly shows a biased state of mind,” Horowitz said, referring to text messages written as the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton's private email use was wrapping up and the Russia probe was getting underway.

The most infamous text, revealed in last week's IG report on the Clinton email case, showed Strzok responding ""We'll stop it"" when his colleague and lover Lisa Page sought assurances that Trump would not become president.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., questioned Horowitz on whether that apparent bias influenced the initiation of the investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 campaign and potential collusion with Trump's team.

“That’s a matter we’ve got under review and are looking at right now,” Horowitz said.

It was revealed earlier this year that Horowitz’s office was investigating allegations of government surveillance abuse tied to the start of the Russia probe. But Horowitz’s testimony, meant to answer questions about the conclusion of the Clinton case review, revealed some of the specifics involved in the ongoing Russia case review, including the Strzok texts.

Goodlatte pressed Horowitz over the politically charged text messages -- which the report described as “hostile” -- and noted how several were sent near the start of the Russia probe.

“Correct,” Horowitz said. “In fact, there were these other text messages in roughly the same time period.”

The exchange came minutes after House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., also outlined the curious timing of a string of texts between Strzok and Page, just as the Russia probe, which Strzok was involved in, was beginning.

Gowdy laid out a timeline—beginning July 5, 2016 when Comey recommended no criminal charges against Clinton, to July 28, 2016, when the FBI initiated a counterintelligence investigation into the Russia issue.

“Three weeks after Clinton is exonerated by Comey, Strzok is leading the investigation into Russia and coordination with the Trump campaign,” Gowdy said Tuesday.

“And damn this feels momentous. Because this matters. The other one did, too, but that was to ensure we didn’t F something up. This matters because this MATTERS,” Strzok texted just days after the Russia probe began in July 2016.

“It almost sounds like they were going through the motions with the Clinton investigation—but boy they sure were excited about the Russia one,” Gowdy said.

Gowdy noted that on Aug. 6, 2016, Page texted Strzok, who was leading the FBI’s Russia investigation, telling him that he was “meant to protect the country from that menace.”

But a new text revealed in Horowitz’s report last week, from Aug. 8, 2016, revealing Strzok vowing to “stop” Trump from becoming president.

According to the report, Page texted Strzok in August 2016 and said: “[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!”

“No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it,” Strzok responded.

Gowdy said that text message was evidence that Strzok had “already prejudged the outcome,” noting that Strzok “already determined Trump should not be president of the United States” just days into the investigation.

By August 15, 2016, Strzok and Page texted about an “insurance policy” should Trump become president.

“I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office - that there’s no way he gets elected - but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk,” Strzok texted on Aug. 15, 2016. “It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40.”

Horowitz testified, in response to Gowdy’s timeline and the texts between Strzok and Page, that the bias found here was “extremely serious.”

“I can’t imagine FBI agents even suggesting that they would use their powers to investigate any candidate for office,” Horowitz said. “I thought this was completely antithetical to the core values of the department and extremely serious.”

The office of the inspector general, though, found no evidence that the bias found impacted prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton email probe.",politics
"The first asylum seeker boat has reached Australia in more than four years, a government minister said Monday, as new concerns were raised about the psychological state of children who arrived earlier and were banished by the government.

Australia has virtually stopped such boat arrivals by using the navy to turn them back and sending asylum seekers who arrive by ship to immigration camps on the poor Pacific island nations of Papua New Guinea and Nauru.

But a group of people recently arrived in northeast Australia on a fishing boat from Vietnam, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said.

""We will work with the agencies to make sure we can repatriate these people back to their country of origin, once we understand the facts of the matter,"" Dutton told reporters.

Vietnamese asylum seekers have been accepted by Australia as legitimate refugees in the past. But Vietnamese have also been intercepted at sea by Australian authorities, had their refugee claims rejected at sea and been sent back to their homeland.

Dutton blamed a failure of surveillance for the boat reaching Cape Kimberley in the World Heritage-listed Daintree Rainforest north of Cairns in Queensland state.

Queensland Police Minister Mark Ryan said 15 asylum seekers had been detained and authorities were searching for others from the Vietnamese boat, which was reported on Sunday.

A previous government announced on July 19, 2013, that any asylum seeker who arrived by boat would not be allowed to settle in Australia. Single men were sent to Papua New Guinea and others were sent to Nauru. The boats, mostly from Indonesian ports, were at the time arriving at a rate of more than one a day carrying asylum seekers from the Middle East, Africa and Asia.

The United States has agreed to accept up to 1,250 of the refugees.

Asylum seeker children on Nauru are now deliberately harming themselves and researching ways to die, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported on Monday.

Leaked documents compiled by immigration department workers and obtained by the ABC reveal a spate of self-harm incidents on the island.

One report from June said a 14-year-old refugee poured gasoline over herself and had a lighter.

Another report from June showed a 10-year-old refugee attempted self-harm by ingesting some sharp metal objects similar to fencing wire.

Former child psychologist Vernon Reynolds, who was employed on the island by the Australian government's health care contractor from August 2016 to April 2018 said she was concerned that some refugee children would die.

""I'm reasonably surprised that no one has,"" she told the ABC.

Reynolds said the children were exhibiting signs of severe trauma.

""They stop eating much, they stop drinking much, they stop looking after the day-to-day self-care,"" she said.

The Department of Home Affairs said Australia gives significant support to Nauru to provide health and welfare services, with various providers contracted to offer age-appropriate care.

The last asylum seekers to reach Australia by boat were 157 Sri Lankans. They were aboard an Indian-flagged ship from the southeast port of Pondicherry when they were intercepted by an Australian customs vessel in late June 2014 and were brought to Australia.",world
"President Trump issued a thiny veiled warning to James Comey on Wednesday as he suggested a forthcoming inspector general report will cause new problems for the fired FBI director.

The president blasted Comey as he departed the White House for an immigration meeting in New York. The two are battling from afar over the controversy the president has dubbed “SPYGATE” -- revelations that a government informant had multiple discussions with members of the Trump campaign in 2016, at the dawn of the Russia investigation.

But after Comey criticized Trump's attacks on the bureau, the president suggested Comey might want to worry more about the looming IG report on the bureau's handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe.

""I think James Comey's got a lot of problems. If you look at what he did, the lies, the tremendous lies, I think Comey's got a lot of problems,"" Trump said on the White House lawn to a group of reporters. ""At some point, they have an IG report. Then let's see what Comey has to say. I assume he's covered in the IG report.""

He added: ""If you look at the lies, all the fiction, I think he's got a lot of problems.""

It's unclear whether Trump has seen that report, but a draft has been circulated internally. Its release is sure to heighten scrutiny on the bureau's actions in 2016. Already, reports have emerged that the IG will fault the FBI for sitting on a batch of Clinton emails discovered late in the campaign.

Meanwhile, Trump and Comey are clashing over the revelations of an informant potentially snooping on his 2016 campaign.

Intelligence and law enforcements interests have defended their role, while Trump and his allies say it amounts to spying on a presidential candidate.

Trump, in a Wednesday morning tweetstorm, called it a “major SPY scandal,” suggesting things have “turned around” on the “Criminal Deep State.”

""Everybody wants this solved. A lot of bad things happened. We now call it spygate,"" Trump said at the White House. ""This issue supersedes a party--this issue supersedes Republicans and Democrats. We want transparency.""

On Wednesday morning, though, Comey weighed in to defend the FBI and its practices.

“Facts matter. The FBI’s use of Confidential Human Sources (the actual term) is tightly regulated and essential to protecting the country,” Comey tweeted. “Attacks on the FBI and lying about its work will do lasting damage to our country. How will Republicans explain this to their grandchildren?”

According to bureau documents, the FBI’s Confidential Human Source Program is considered warranted when it is “prudent and necessary to provide protection to the identity” of the source, “the information itself,” and the source’s “relationship with the FBI.”

The bureau defines a confidential human source as “any individual who is believed to be providing useful and credible information to the FBI for any authorized information collection activity, and from whom the FBI expects or intends to obtain additional, useful, and credible information,” and whose identity should remain confidential.

The president Wednesday also told reporters that he did ""a great service to this country by firing James Comey.""

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also defended the intelligence community’s use of the program on Tuesday, claiming that the FBI informant had to do with “the Russians, not spying on the campaign.”

Clapper, appearing on ABC’s “The View,” addressed the controversy after being asked whether the FBI spied on the Trump campaign.

“No, they were not,” Clapper said. “They were spying, a term I don’t particularly like, on what the Russians were doing, trying to understand, were the Russians infiltrating?”

Clapper downplayed the informant, noting that Trump “should be” happy about the informant’s role.

But on Wednesday, Trump fired back at Clapper.

“’Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign’ No, James Clapper, I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!” Trump tweeted.

Amid the controversy, the Justice Department instructed its inspector general to investigate any alleged “impropriety or political motivation” in the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election, following demands from Trump.

Earlier this week, the president met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray in the Oval Office, discussing the expansion of Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation to include “irregularities” with the FBI or DOJ’s “tactics concerning the Trump campaign.”

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also said that during the meeting, the three agreed that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly would “immediately set up a meeting with the FBI, DOJ, and DNI together with congressional leaders to review highly classified and other information they have requested.”

That meeting is slated for Thursday, and will be with House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, Wray, and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.

Meanwhile, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House counterpart Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Wednesday sent a letter to Rosenstein and Wray urging them to “reconsider” or at least conduct the meeting in a “bipartisan” fashion.

“For the President of the United States to pressure the Justice Department to reveal details and documents pertaining to an active investigation of the President’s campaign, for the purpose of denigrating it, is a gross and unprecedented abuse of power,” Schumer tweeted.",politics
"In her quest to become New York’s next governor, Cynthia Nixon has advocated for a single-payer health care system in the state – something studies have shown would be a costly endeavor.

The proposed New York Health Act (NYHA), which would establish universal health care for everyone in the state, including undocumented immigrants, would require the state’s tax revenue to increase by about 156 percent by 2022, according to a study by the RAND Corp. But it also found state spending on total health care under NYHA would be slightly lower – about 3 percent – by 2031 than under the current system.

Nixon recently told the New York Daily News editorial board she did not yet have a plan to pay for single-payer.

“Pass it and then figure out how to fund it,” Nixon said.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who Nixon is challenging in the Democratic primary next week, has said it should be up to the federal government to pass a universal health care system. During a debate between the two candidates last month, Cuomo said the NYHA was good “in theory,” but would cost more than New York’s annual budget to implement it “in the long-term,” according to the Albany Times Union.

'SEX AND THE CITY' STAR CYNTHIA NIXON COULD BE NEW YORK'S NEXT GOVERNOR: A LOOK AT HER POLITICAL ACTIVISM

Nixon, on the other hand, has said a single-payer system will save the state and New Yorkers money overall.

There is widespread disagreement over how much it would cost to implement a single-payer health care system. Supporters say it would cut excessive administrative costs compared to those incurred by private insurers. But critics, including most Republicans, warn the savings would be less dramatic than expected – and the system would cost too much.

Joe White, president of the Council for Affordable Health Coverage, has estimated that with single-payer ""costs and taxes will rise, or patient access will be severely diminished – turning America’s medical system into a third-world product.”

The Medicare-for-all bill proposed earlier this year by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was estimated to cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years by a Mercatus Center at George Mason University study.

ANDREW CUOMO, CYNTHIA NIXON ACCUSE EACH OTHER OF LYING, CORRUPTION IN HEATED PRIMARY DEBATE

The term “single-payer health care” denotes only one entity bears the financial responsibility of health care – the government. Under this system, the government would be solely responsible for covering health care costs.

“The basic idea of single-payer is to cover everybody with a single government program, and that program would basically cover all the doctors and hospitals,” Dr. Adam Gaffney, an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, told Fox News.

As the Times Union reported, the NYHA has continuously been introduced by Democrats in the state Assembly every year since 1992 but has been unsuccessful in the Senate.",politics
"The same judge who praised the Trump administration for its “collaborative” effort to reunite families separated at the border is now saying he's having second thoughts about whether the government is acting in “good faith.”

U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw criticized the administration late Friday evening, calling into question the safety of a new plan filed by the Department of Justice to reunite more than 2,500 children over the age of 5 by the July 26 deadline.

After Friday’s hearing, the DOJ filed a reunification plan that would meet the July 26 deadline via ""truncated"" procedures to verify parentage and perform background checks, which exclude DNA testing and other steps to reunify families of children under 5.

The administration said the abbreviated vetting puts children at significant safety risk but is needed to meet the deadline.

Chris Meekins, the deputy assistant health and human services secretary for preparedness and response, said that while he is committed to meeting the deadline, he does not believe ""placing of children into such situations is consistent with the mission of HHS or my core values.""

Sabraw fired back, second-guessing remarks he'd made hours earlier.

""It is clear from Mr. Meekins' declaration that HHS either does not understand the court's orders or is acting in defiance of them. … At a minimum, it appears he is attempting to provide cover to defendants for their own conduct in the practice of family separation, and the lack of foresight and infrastructure necessary to remedy the harms caused by that practice.”

He said that the official’s statement “calls into question” his earlier comment that the government was acting in “good faith.” Sabraw said that safe reunification could and will occur by July 26.

"Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing got off to a rocky start as multiple Democrats interjected and called for a delay – citing complaints that they haven't seen all his records and only just received some of them.

Kavanaugh, 53, has served for the past 12 years on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. He was involved with the independent counsel’s report in laying out the legal framework supporting then-President Bill Clinton’s impeachment and served in key positions in the White House when George W. Bush was president.

He faces questions about his opinions on presidential authority, particularly as Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation continues.

The contentious hearing has repeatedly been interrupted and fallen behind schedule as Democrats have called to pause the hearing due to document requests.

Sen. Kamala Harris, considered a potential 2020 Democratic presidential contender, raised objections to the recent release of some 42,000 documents just before the hearing kicked off; others called for a delay until the White House reverses course on its withholding of more than 100,000 pages of Kavanaugh's record related to his time in the Bush administration.

Read on for a look at what lawmakers have had access to – and what Democrats want.

What documents does the committee have?

In all, about 267,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents from his Bush years have been made public with more than 147,000 pages given just to the committee.

Former President George W. Bush’s attorneys told the Senate Judiciary Committee Bush requested they “err as much as appropriate on the side of transparency and disclosure” in releasing documents to the committee. It said it withheld more than 46,000 documents – from both the public and the committee – because they were State Department records Kavanaugh possessed for consultation, did not fall within the time frame requested by the committee or were marked “protected by constitutional privilege” by the White House or Justice Department.

CORNYN SAYS DEMOCRATS INTERRUPTING KAVANAUGH SUPREME COURT HEARING WOULD BE ‘IN CONTEMPT OF COURT’

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said the panel had been given access to more than 480,000 pages of emails and other documents from his service as an executive branch lawyer, more than 10,000 pages of judicial writings and 17,000 pages of speeches, articles, teaching materials and other items Kavanaugh attached to his 120-page questionnaire response.

Grassley, a Republican, also said the committee was able to review some 307 opinions he authored as well as hundreds more he joined.

“This is a half million pages of paper – more than the last five confirmed Supreme Court nominees combined,” Grassley, who has defended the document production as the most open in history, said.

Additionally, some 42,000 documents were made available to the committee relating to Kavanaugh’s work with past administrations just before the hearing’s start on Sept. 4.

KAVANAUGH SUPREME COURT HEARING KICKS OFF WITH NUMEROUS ARRESTS AS PROTESTERS SHOUT DOWN LAWMAKERS

Democrats vociferously argued for a delay in the hearing in order to have more time to review the documents. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, in particular, said it was impossible to go through them all in time for a fair hearing.

What do Democrats want?

The White House blocked about 100,000 documents pertaining to Kavanaugh’s records from the Bush White House on the basis of presidential privilege – a point of contention for Democrats.

“We don’t know what is being hidden,” Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said during the hearing.

Schumer blasted President Trump ahead of the hearing for the withholding of certain documents.

KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HEARING LIKELY TO FOCUS ON ABORTION, GUN RIGHTS AND MORE

“President Trump’s decision to step in at the last moment and hide [100,000] pages of Judge Kavanaugh’s records from the American public is not only unprecedented in the history of [Supreme Court nominees], it has all the makings of a cover up,” Schumer said in a tweet.

Democrats have also blasted Republicans for not requesting certain records, such as those pertaining to Kavanaugh’s time as a staff secretary.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., claimed Senate Democrats were not able to see records pertaining to “35 months of public service” as they “cannot even be considered.”

But Grassley, who has repeatedly rebuffed demands to postpone the hearing, said those documents “are the least useful in understanding his legal views and [are] the most sensitive to the executive branch.”

“What is being hidden and why?” Leahy asked Tuesday.

"Tuesday’s opening day of Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee devolved into chicanery and chaos, as a litany of hecklers repeatedly interrupted speakers.

The atmosphere became so heated that Ashley Kavanaugh, the judge’s wife, was forced to escort her visibly upset daughters – 13-year-old Margaret and 10-year-old Liza –from the hearing room.

Is this what we’ve become?

When the children of a Supreme Court nominee are forced to witness members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and public attendees berate and belittle their father – and dishonestly call his character into question – it’s obvious that civility and respect are in short supply.

From Supreme Court hearings to bakeries and burger joints, can we not respect the dignity of people with whom we may have significant disagreements?

Kavanaugh is clearly a good man who is deeply committed to his family, his church and his career. He should of course be subject to questioning from senators at his confirmation hearing. But he should not be eviscerated on national television.

Regrettably, what we saw unfold at the first day of Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing scheduled to continue through Friday is a microcosm of a broader strategy used by some people to harass, intimidate and shame people who hold opposing views.

It’s one thing to oppose the nomination of a Supreme Court nominee. But it’s another thing to say that a vote for Kavanaugh is tantamount to being “complicit in evil” – which is precisely what Senator Cory Booker, D-N.J., said in the days leading up to the hearing.

It’s one thing to disagree with In-N-Out Burger donating to Republican candidates. But it’s another thing to call for a boycott of the restaurant chain – which is what California Democratic Party official Eric Bauman did last week. (Never mind that In-N-Out also donated to Democratic candidates.)

Sadly, decorum and civility in political life have become increasingly rare. And both politicians and pundits have resorted to cheap theatrics and the tactics of schoolyard bullies.

I find it ironic that many of the same people who praised the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for his good manners and overall decency have no problem with the nasty tone surrounding Tuesday’s hearing. In fact, many are contributing to it.

Fair-minded opposition is a hallmark of this country, but there is nothing fair about besmirching a person’s character simply because you disagree with him or her.

When is all of this going to stop?

Is this really how we want to live and treat one another? Surely it is not.

From Supreme Court hearings to bakeries and burger joints, can we not respect the dignity of people with whom we may have significant disagreements?

My friend Dr. Tim Keller, the former senior pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, once said the reason the melting pot of New York City has worked so well is that people there haven’t gone out of their way to stick their fingers in the eyes of people of other traditions.

As a father, my heart aches for Judge Kavanaugh’s daughters. But I’m also proud that Ashley Kavanaugh had the good sense to remove the couple’s daughters and limit their exposure to such vulgarity.

Um Sam An, a member of the now-dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, was sentenced in October 2016 to 2 1/2 years in prison for making comments on the politically sensitive topic and implying that Prime Minister Hun Sen's government failed to counter land encroachment by Vietnam, Cambodia's traditional enemy.

In a letter on Saturday, King Norodom Sihamoni said Um Sam An had been granted amnesty from his jail term. The amnesty was granted at the request of Hun Sen.

In handing out the sentence in 2016, a judge said the accusations made by Um Sam An in 2015 Facebook posts aimed to cause chaos in society. The lawmaker was arrested in April 2016 in the Cambodian city of Siem Reap after having returned from a trip to the United States.

Um Sam An is the latest political prisoner to be released from jail in the last week.

On Tuesday, two Cambodian journalists who had worked for U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia and who have been charged with espionage were released on bail. A day earlier, four women jailed for participating in Cambodia's land rights movement were freed under a royal pardon requested by Hun Sen.

Hun Sen cracked down on critics and opponents last year in what was seen as an effort to ensure his party would win elections held this year. His party did win last month's polls, though the vote was widely seen as lacking credibility.

Hun Sen, who has been in office since 1985 and has held a tight grip on power since ousting a co-prime minister in a bloody 1997 coup, has a record of cracking down harshly when facing a serious challenge, then effecting reconciliation when he no longer feels threatened. The pattern keeps human rights groups and Western governments off balance and moderates their criticism.",world
"Overall enrollment in the country’s food stamp program has dropped to its lowest level in more than eight years as the economy continues to improve and the Trump administration attempts to tackle fraud in the program.

According to the latest statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), enrollment in the program dropped in March to 40,083,954. The last time food stamp participation dipped this low was in February 2010, when 39,588,993 people were enrolled in the program.

""As the economy continues to improve, participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is declining,"" a USDA official who asked for anonymity told Fox News. ""SNAP was established as a temporary supplemental nutrition benefit guiding people to self-sufficiency and self-reliance, not a permanent way of life.""

The USDA official noted that much like jobless numbers, the number of enrollees in SNAP tends to fluctuate month by month. But the official added that the agency expects about 8.8 million to leave the program in the next 10 years.

SNAP, which was formerly known as the Food Stamps Program, is a federal program that provides grocery assistance for people out of work or with low incomes living in the U.S. To qualify for the program, individuals must make 130 percent or less of the federal poverty level based on the household size.

The program is meant to help people buy nutritional items like breads, vegetables, dairy products and meats, while barring them from purchasing alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and household supplies and paper products among other items.

While overall food stamp enrollment has been on a steady decline since 2013, some observers credit President Trump’s emphasis on getting more Americans back to work and his administration’s crackdown on fraud in the SNAP program as the reason why the decline has sped up.

“It’s a long time coming,” Robert Doar, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told Fox News. “These numbers are dropping because people are going back to work.”

Since Trump took office, more than 2.2 million have discontinued their participation in the SNAP program in large part due to his administration’s moves to reform SNAP.

Trump in February proposed a 30 percent, or $214 billion, cut to SNAP as part of the White House's federal budget proposal.

In April, Trump signed an executive order aiming to harden up work requirements for welfare and public assistance programs. The order, which aims to reduce poverty “by promoting opportunity and economic mobility,” calls for agencies to strengthen work requirements and to look for new ones.

“They have to stop playing to the cheap seats.” - Rep. Jim McGovern

“The Federal Government should do everything within its authority to empower individuals by providing opportunities for work, including by investing in Federal programs that are effective at moving people into the workforce and out of poverty,” the executive order stated. “It must examine Federal policies and programs to ensure that they are consistent with principles that are central to the American spirit — work, free enterprise and safeguarding human and economic resources.”

Following Trump’s order, the House Agriculture Committee voted to tighten the already existing work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), while expanding funding for state training programs. The legislation passed Wednesday by the committee would require all “work capable adults” between the age of 18 and 59 to work or participate in work training for 20 hours per week. The tweak means a greater number of people would have to work or enroll in work training.

The USDA in March also announced that it had hired an “integrity officer” who would monitor any instances of fraud in the SNAP program and, in February, Trump announced the rollout of the so-called “Harvest Box” program – an initiative to give food stamp recipients a box of “shelf-stable” foods along with the SNAP allotment.

“The Harvest Box is a silly idea and probably not going anywhere,” Doar said. “But the integrity office is a good step to take…It helps make sure that the program is not only about getting the benefits, but also making sure people are getting back to work.”

The moves by the Trump administration to clamp down on who can receive food stamps has drawn a strong rebuke from numerous Democrats and advocacy groups that work with low-income people and families. Many argue that Trump is manipulating the view of who receives food stamps and that SNAP already had work requirements built into the program

Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern told the New York Times in February that Trump was painting a “distorted picture” of those who receive food stamps by saying that they are scamming SNAP and avoiding work.

“They have to stop playing to the cheap seats,” he said. “The majority of people in the program are children and seniors and people working in jobs that pay too little to feed their families.”",politics
"As part of Nikki Haley's push to advance the Trump administration's “America First” agenda at the United Nations, the hard-charging ambassador is fighting for U.S. businesses to get a bigger slice of the more than $18 billion in contracts the world body hands out each year.



The U.S. already is the biggest recipient of these procurement contracts, but officials say that number is growing since Haley took office. In 2017, the U.S. won $1.74 billion in contracts -- approximately 9 percent of the $18.6 billion available. The next highest was India, which picked up 4.8 percent of all contracts.



That marks almost a 10 percent uptick in contracts awarded to U.S. businesses from 2016.



But Haley and the U.S. Mission aren’t done, and are looking at ways to get more lucrative contracts awarded. It’s part of a broader effort by Haley and the Trump administration to make sure the United Nations' biggest contributor gets a better deal there.



“We are very proud of our American companies, from the quality of their products to the efficiencies of their services. We will continue to use all of the resources we have available to help our companies win U.N. contracts,” Haley told Fox News.

Her office is not necessarily strongarming the U.N. into awarding contracts to American companies -- it is a competitive process -- but is urging those companies to seek U.N. business while facilitating meetings between them and U.N. officials.

Cherith Norman Chalet, the U.S. representative for U.N. Management and Reform, told Fox News that the U.S. Mission is increasing the number of seminars across the country that feature business representatives and officials from U.N. agencies, including UNICEF and the World Food Program.

“It's to try to help companies understand the process, what the opportunities are at the U.N. and what the needs the U.N. are looking for, so really trying to matchmake in the best possible way,” she said.



Whereas in recent years there would be a few general seminars a year, all in New York, this year the U.S. Mission -- working with the Commerce Department -- is holding a number of state-specific seminars across America.

So far, these have been held in Wisconsin, Rhode Island and Mississippi. On Thursday, a seminar in Detroit, Mich., featured more than 150 companies along with representatives from the Secretariat, U.N. Development Program, the World Food Program and UNICEF.



In October, there will be a private-sector day, which will also include discussions and information about the policy side of the U.N. and the impact on businesses.



Another more general seminar is being planned in New York this fall on the subject of aviation, in hopes of leveling the playing field on a contract area that traditionally has been dominated by Russia.



The goal, Chalet said, is ""to increase visibility of the U.S. Mission led by Ambassador Haley, showing that we’re going to go further in ensuring that U.S. companies have equal opportunity at the U.N. and that we will continue to be the number one in procuring those contracts.”

HALEY PRESSURES ARAB STATES TO STEP UP ON PALESTINIAN AID: 'WE ARE NOT FOOLS'

“We’ve done well and we’re doing better and we have more to go,” she said.



While the numbers on 2018 contracts are not yet available, officials say they are hopeful for continued growth and the seminars have seen a significant increase in attendance.



In addition to the 9 percent increase in procurement contracts, the U.S. says the number of U.S. companies registered as vendors on the U.N. Global Marketplace -- where companies register to bid on U.N. contracts and to be alerted about available contracts -- spiked from 10,545 in 2016 to 16,004 in 2017



“From what we can tell based on the seminars, as well as interaction with U.N., what these have done this year is really match the needs and increased awareness of companies so they can be even better prepared to put in the bids, and be more successful in being selected,” Chalet said.



The Better World Campaign, which pushes for better relations between the U.S. and the U.N., hailed the developments and noted that while the top states that benefited from contracts were New York, New Jersey, Maryland and California, the benefits were being felt across the country.



“Forty-two states plus Washington D.C. are home to American companies that were awarded UN contracts in 2017,” President Peter Yao said in a statement.



“This new data confirms that the U.N. is not only in America’s foreign policy and national security interests, American corporations also benefit more than any other country in the world from procurement contracts with the U.N,” he said.

The push represents part of the broader effort by the U.N.-skeptical administration to get a better value at the organization, even as it moves to punish some arms of the world body.

While Haley has been a primary driver of action at the Security Council on areas such as North Korea and South Sudan, the U.S. has also pulled back where it doesn’t see that value.

The administration has withdrawn from the Human Rights Council, calling it a ""cesspool of political bias,"" and has gutted funding to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA). The U.S. has also demanded cuts to the U.N. budget.

"President Trump renewed pressure Friday on Jeff Sessions to investigate the actions of his adversaries – what he called “corruption” on the “other side” – after the attorney general warned the president that his department would not be “improperly influenced” by politics.

In an extraordinary new clash between the president and the nation’s top law enforcement official, whom Trump appointed and who was one of the president’s earliest and most enthusiastic 2016 supporters, Sessions had issued the warning a day earlier after Trump alleged in a “Fox & Friends” interview that his AG never “took control” of the DOJ.

“I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in,” Sessions fired back.

In a set of Friday morning tweets, Trump cited that statement as a jumping off point for what he wants Sessions to pursue next:

“Jeff, this is GREAT, what everyone wants, so look into all of the corruption on the 'other side' including deleted Emails, Comey lies & leaks, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr … FISA abuse, Christopher Steele & his phony and corrupt Dossier, the Clinton Foundation, illegal surveillance of Trump Campaign, Russian collusion by Dems - and so much more. Open up the papers & documents without redaction? Come on Jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting!”

The list referred to a batch of controversies Trump and his allies have long cited as a partisan counterweight to allegations of Russia collusion and obstruction of justice, at the heart of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe. Trump was citing a slew of fired and former FBI officials – ex-director James Comey, anti-Trump agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, ex-deputy Andrew McCabe – and sitting DOJ official Bruce Ohr whose wife worked for the company behind the salacious anti-Trump dossier. The tweets also referred to the surveillance efforts against his campaign associates and Hillary Clinton’s email and foundation controversies.

Democrats have long accused Republicans of trying to distract from the Mueller probe by focusing on such matters, but Trump and his allies argue there’s never been a full accounting for how political actions may have factored into the start of the Russia probe.

Meanwhile, the Trump-Sessions feud has instantly renewed speculation over how long Sessions can hold on in his current position.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Thursday that despite Sessions’ accomplishments, he believes it “very likely” Trump will appoint a new attorney general, perhaps after the midterms.

Trump upped the pressure on Sessions even more Friday when he cited the jail sentence given Thursday to leaker Reality Winner.

“Ex-NSA contractor to spend 63 months in jail over ‘classified’ information. Gee, this is ‘small potatoes’ compared to what Hillary Clinton did! So unfair Jeff, Double Standard,” he tweeted.

The tweets followed Sessions statement Thursday in which he staunchly defended his actions in office:

“I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President’s agenda—one that protects the safety and security rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty.”

He went on to say, “While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.”

The president for months has railed against Sessions over his recusal from the Russia probe. Sessions recused himself in 2017, due to his involvement with the Trump campaign, per Justice Department regulations.

Rod Rosenstein, his deputy, was then named to oversee the investigation. He appointed Mueller as special counsel.

"There is tight security in Zimbabwe's capital Wednesday as the Constitutional Court is set to hear the main opposition party's challenge to the results of last month's historic presidential election.

Police have barricaded the roads around the court in central Harare as tensions have risen ahead of the crucial court case which will decide if the election of President Emmerson Mnangagwa is valid.

The opposition claims the vote had ""gross mathematical errors"" and it seeks a fresh election or a declaration that its candidate Nelson Chamisa is the winner of the July 30 vote.

The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission declared Mnangagwa narrowly won with 50.8 percent of the vote, avoiding a runoff. Chamisa received 44.3 percent, said the commission.

The election was the first after the fall of longtime leader Robert Mugabe. Many hoped the peaceful vote would launch a new era for Zimbabwe but two days later six people were killed when the military swept into the capital to disperse opposition protesters.

Western election observers and diplomats condemned the ""excessive"" use of force.

Chamisa's challenge claims the electoral commission bumped up Mnangagwa's figures through double counts and the creation of ""ghost"" polling stations. It also alleges that some polling stations recorded more voters than those registered to vote.

Mnangagwa and the electoral commission argue the application should be dismissed on a technicality, because it was filed too late and that papers were not properly served on respondents.

In his affidavit, Mnangagwa argues the court should not hear Chamisa'a application because he ""scandalized"" the court by claiming during political rallies that the judiciary was biased toward the ruling party, ZANU-PF. Mnangagwa accuses Chamisa of making ""illusionary promises"" to voters during campaign.

The case will be televised live by the state broadcaster, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, but the courts have ruled that the proceedings cannot be livestreamed on social media. Journalists and other people accredited by the court will follow proceedings from a giant television screen on the court premises, but they are not permitted to carry mobile phones or laptops, preventing them from filing during the case.

This is not the first time the opposition has challenged election results in court. Following the 2013 presidential election, then main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai filed a challenge before the court. He later withdrew the challenge claiming he would not get a fair hearing. The court declined his withdrawal and proceeded to rule on the case on favor of Mugabe.

According to Veritas, a legal think tank based in Harare, the court can declare a winner or invalidate the election and call for a fresh election or make any other order it considers ""just and appropriate.""

"An Iranian civil aviation company is suspected of smuggling arms into Lebanon, destined for the militant group Hezbollah and Iranian weapons factories -- and western intelligence sources said Monday they've uncovered the unexpected routes that Iran apparently took to try avoiding detection.

The sources identified two rare and unusual Qeshm Fars Air flights from Tehran to the international airport in Beirut during the past two months.

The first flight, on July 9, involved a Boeing 747 that departed from an air force base in Tehran, stopped for a short layover at the international airport in Damascus, Syria, and then continued with a rather “uncharacteristic flight path” to the Beirut international airport, where it landed shortly after 4 p.m. local time.

According to flight data obtained by Fox News, the route passed over northern Lebanon, not following any commonly used flight path. A regional intelligence source who asked to remain anonymous said: “The Iranians are trying to come up with new ways and routes to smuggle weapons from Iran to its allies in the Middle East, testing and defying the West’s abilities to track them down.”

Western intelligence sources said the airplane carried components for manufacturing precise weapons in Iranian factories inside Lebanon. The U.S. and Israel, as well as other western intelligence agencies, have supplied evidence that Iran has operated weapons factories in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.

Last week, citing Iranian, Iraqi and Western sources, the Reuters news agency reported that Iran had transferred short-range ballistic missiles to its Shiite allies inside Iraq in recent months. Tehran and Baghdad formally denied that report.

The second flight was conducted on August 2. Flight number QFZ9960 landed in Beirut at 5:59 pm, after departing Tehran's international airport two and a half hours earlier. This time, the plane did not stop in Damascus, but it followed a slightly irregular route north of Syria.

Qeshm Fars Air is considered one of the various pseudo-civilian airlines used for arms-smuggling by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the elite Al-Quds force led by Qassem Soleimani. Back in October 2017, President Trump imposed sanctions on the IRGC and the Al-Quds force.

The airline had ceased operations in 2013, citing poor management, but restarted under new management in March 2017. It is said to have two Boeing 747s in its fleet. Among the members of the company’s board are three IRGC representatives: Ali Naghi Gol Parsta, Hamid Reza Pahlvani and Gholamreza Qhasemi.

The United States is Lebanon’s primary security partner, according to the State Department. Since 2006, the U.S has provided Lebanon over $1.7 billion in security assistance, in part to counter Hezbollah’s influences.

"Michael Flynn lied. Not once, but twice.

He lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russia. For that, he was fired by President Trump as national security adviser.

Flynn also lied to the FBI about the same subject. For that, he was charged and pleaded guilty in federal court Friday to a single count of making false statements.

As part of his plea, Flynn agreed to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. This inexorably invites two questions: Will Flynn implicate anyone else in the Trump administration, including the president? And if so, for what crime?

There is nothing in Flynn’s plea agreement or “Statement of the Offense” that implicates President Trump in these conversations with Russia during the transition.

Some insight is offered in the “Statement of the Offense” that Flynn signed on Friday during his guilty plea. In the statement, Flynn identifies two separate conversations he had with Sergey Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States.

According to the statement, one conversation involved Russia’s reaction to a United Nations resolution on Israeli settlements. The other, a week later, dealt with Russia’s response to President Obama’s executive order on Russian sanctions. Each time, one or more “senior officials” on the Trump transition team conferred with Flynn on what information to convey.

The only conceivable crime these communications with Russia could constitute falls under the Logan Act. But that antiquated law has no application for several reasons.

First, the Logan Act was enacted in 1799. It makes it a felony for a private citizen to interfere in international disputes between the U.S. and foreign governments. But no one has ever been prosecuted under the act, principally because most lawyers, legal scholars and judges agree that it is likely unconstitutional.

Since no one has ever been convicted of violating the Logan Act, no court has ever ruled on its constitutionality directly.

However, courts have commented on the Logan Act from time to time. In 1964, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Waldron v. British Petroleum Co., 231 F. Supp. 72) stated that the act was likely unconstitutional because it is vague, overly broad and ambiguous.

Numerous scholarly publications have argued that the Logan Act also violates the right to free speech under the First Amendment. So its legal efficacy is doubtful.

Second, Flynn was not acting as a private citizen, as the law defines it. He was serving in a wholly different capacity – as a government representative of a president about to assume office.

Flynn was preparing the incoming administration for the foreign policy challenges that lay ahead and establishing the kind of vital contact that assists a new president in formulating effective relationships and policies. In other words, Flynn was doing his job. He did it in the same manner that other transition officials have in previous administrations.

Several months ago I spoke with Professor W. David Clinton, chairman of the Political Science Department at Baylor University, who co-authored the seminal book “Presidential Transitions and American Foreign Policy.”

Clinton stated that it is quite normal and routine for incoming transition teams to have lengthy and detailed conversations with foreign government officials about forthcoming changes in policies. Indeed, Clinton said it would be abnormal if this did not happen.

“It is common for representatives of other governments to get in touch with the incoming presidential administration to begin informal relationships and address relevant issues,” Clinton said. “It is not unusual. Transitions are fairly long. The incoming administration needs to inform itself of foreign policy. Getting to know people and foreign governments is widely done and beneficial to the U.S.”

Finally, it appears that Flynn and the transition team did not “interfere” with a diplomatic dispute, under the meaning of the Logan Act. To the contrary, Flynn sought ways to de-escalate tensions over U.S. sanctions by asking the Russian government to limit its response “in a reciprocal manner.”

By doing this, Flynn was acting for the benefit of the U.S. government and in a manner not inconsistent with the Obama administration’s wishes and policy. He can hardly be criticized for it, much less prosecuted.

On the other matter, Flynn admits he urged Russia to either delay or veto a United Nations resolution that condemned Israel’s settlements as a “flagrant violation” of international law. This surely came as no surprise to the Russians or the Obama administration, since it conformed with the same public statement President-elect Trump issued that very day

Flynn contacted the Russians about the pending vote. Trump tweeted: “The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed.”

Thus, there was nothing secret, nefarious or illegal about Flynn’s communications with Moscow. And in the end, it didn’t matter. Russia ignored Flynn’s request and voted in favor of the resolution, which passed with 14 votes.

Officially, the U.S. took no position on the resolution. By abstaining, it neither supported the resolution nor opposed it. And since the measure imposed no sanctions, it was nothing more than an idle diplomatic statement.

Even if Trump reached out to the Russians in an effort to find common ways to fight the scourge of ISIS in Syria, as ABC is reporting, such actions are entirely commensurate with longstanding U.S. goals in the war on terrorism and in no way impede the policy of the man he was chosen to succeed.

Are these, therefore, violations of the Logan Act? Absolutely not.

An incoming president has every right to voice his position on matters of foreign policy. There is no evidence that Flynn’s actions interfered with anything that wasn’t already in the interests of the United States or otherwise altered the course of a diplomatic dispute. This is probably why Flynn was not charged under the Logan Act.

The U.S. has never criminalized the conduct of foreign policy by incoming presidents. Others have sought to change overseas policy before taking office, sometimes quite openly. Significantly, there is nothing in Flynn’s plea agreement or “Statement of the Offense” that implicates President Trump in these conversations with Russia during the transition.

Nor is there any accusation or evidence that Trump or others conspired with Moscow to influence the presidential election during the campaign. This is supposed to be what Special Counsel Mueller is investigating. Yet, he has uncovered only ancillary wrongdoing that is entirely unrelated to so-called “collusion.”

Flynn’s guilty plea to a single count of making false statements is the least serious of any the offenses he could have faced. It is likely he will be given probation.

Still, it is inexplicable why a distinguished retired general like Michael Flynn would lie to the FBI about something that is not, by itself, a crime. Sometimes, smart people make stupid choices.

But it would be a mistake to conclude that Flynn’s commitment to cooperate with the special counsel means that President Trump is in legal jeopardy. The president is certainly not under the Logan Act.",politics
"A graduate of Berkeley High School in California, who reportedly told authorities he wanted to help ISIS kill 10,000 people in the San Francisco Bay Area, pleaded guilty to federal charges Wednesday, while his attorney claimed he was a victim of the “system.”

Amer Sinan Alhaggagi, 23, of Oakland, pleaded guilty in federal court to trying to provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization, possession of device-making equipment and identity theft, the U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI announced.

Authorities arrested Alhaggagi in November 2016 after he bought clothes online with a phony credit card, but he was held so federal authorities could continue to investigate him, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

Alhaggagi allegedly opened several Twitter and Facebook accounts in 2016 for ISIS supporters. He then allegedly told an undercover FBI agent that he wanted to kill 10,000 people in the Bay Area with bombs and rat-poison-laced cocaine, the Chronicle reported, citing court documents.

He met with the undercover agent, pointed out locations for terrorist attacks and brought three backpacks to be used in a future attack to a storage locker, the paper reported. But Alhaggagi broke off talks with the agent after their last meeting.

“The government sent out an undercover agent to get Amer to actually do something, take a step toward a terrorist offense. He just wouldn’t do it.” - Mary McNamara, defense attorney

His attorney, Mary McNamara, told the East Bay Times that Alhaggagi’s actions were “stupid mistakes” and he “had no intention to do anything.” She called the government’s action a “failed sting operation.”

“The government sent out an undercover agent to get Amer to actually do something, take a step toward a terrorist offense,” she said. “He just wouldn’t do it.”

He faces a maximum of 47 years in prison. But McNamara told the Chronicle her client was “being slammed by the system” and hoped to get the sentence down to just six to seven years.

“This is really a case about what the appropriate sentence should be, and here is a young guy who is immature, said some stupid things online, and the FBI sent out their best people to try to get a sting operation going,” she said.

Alhaggagi was being held without bail in Glenn E. Dyer jail in Oakland. His sentencing was scheduled for November.",politics
"President Donald Trump was directly involved in meetings where officials decided to move forward with a controversial plan to build a new FBI headquarters in the nation's capital, according to a government report issued Monday.



The report from the General Services Administration inspector general cites two White House meetings in January and June of this year in which Trump participated.



In the first of those meetings, participants agreed to move forward on a proposal to demolish the existing J. Edgar Hoover building in downtown Washington and build a new headquarters in the same spot.



While there is widespread agreement that the Hoover Building -- a crumbling, sprawling piece of Brutalist architecture built in 1974 -- does not meet the FBI's needs, the plan to keep the FBI in Washington scraps a long held plan to move the FBI to the Maryland or Virginia suburbs.



Rep. Gerry Connolly, a northern Virginia Democrat who supports moving the FBI to the suburbs, called for additional congressional hearings to uncover the extent of Trump's involvement. He said the project is rife with conflicts of interest for Trump, whose Trump International Hotel is essentially across the street from the FBI headquarters.



""When we began this investigation, the prospect that President Trump was personally involved in the government-led redevelopment of a property in close proximity to the Trump Hotel was dismissed as a conspiracy theory,"" Connolly said.



The extent of Trump's involvement in the decision is unclear. The report indicates that while GSA employees confirmed the White House meetings with Trump, they received instructions not to divulge any statements Trump made at those meetings.



The first meeting in which Trump's participation was documented, according to the IG report, came in January 2018. That was before the GSA proposed a plan to raze the Hoover building and build a new headquarters in its place, but after the GSA announced in 2017 that it was scrapping its plans for a move to the suburbs.



The IG report also concludes that officials are greatly underestimating the cost of keeping the headquarters in Washington. In particular, the report concludes that GSA is not taking into account the money that could be realized by selling the land under the Hoover building to private developers.



The GSA issued a statement in response to the IG report saying its estimates ""are accurate, transparent, and more representative of the full costs of the project than the analysis put forth in the IG review.""



There is also some question about whether GSA Administrator Emily Murphy was forthcoming about Trump's role when she testified about the relocation decision to Congress.



When Murphy was asked whether the White House or Trump specifically was involved in the decision to abandon the suburbs and rebuild in Washington, Murphy said it was the FBI that decided it wanted to stay in Washington. She did not disclose the White House meetings and told the inspector general she was trying to answer the question as she understood it.



The IG's report concludes that Murphy's testimony to a House committee ""was incomplete and may have left the misleading impression that she had no discussions with the President or senior White House officials in the decision-making process about the project.""



The GSA, in its response to the report, states, ""The IG review acknowledges an indisputable fact: the Administrator's congressional testimony was truthful.""",politics
"Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday the return of the remains of 55 Americans presumed dead from the Korean War was a sign of ""tangible progress in our efforts to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula.""

Pence spoke at a ceremony at Hawaii's Hickam Air Force Base to mark the arrival of the remains on U.S. soil and the beginning of long process to identify them.

""Today, they are known but to God,"" said Pence, whose father fought in Korea. ""But soon we will know their names and we will tell their stories of courage.""

The return of the remains was part of an agreement reached during a June summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

""I know President Trump is grateful that Chairman Kim kept his word,"" Pence said. ""But today is just a beginning, and our work will not be complete until all our fallen heroes are accounted for.""

North Korea handed over the remains last week. A U.S. military plane made a rare trip into North Korea to retrieve 55 cases containing the remains. Hundreds of U.S. and South Korean troops gathered for a repatriation ceremony at the Osan base in South Korea before the cases were put on military planes bound for Hawaii.

After Pence spoke Wednesday, the cases were removed from C-17 transport planes and placed on stanchions in a hangar as a military band played hymns. Each container was accompanied by one Marine, one sailor, one soldier and one airman.

Pence watched the procession with his hand over his heart. Adm. Phil Davidson, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, saluted.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week that the return of the 55 cases was a positive step but not a guarantee that the bones are American. At the repatriation ceremony in South Korea, the cases were draped in United Nations flags in a possible sign of that uncertainty. On Wednesday, however, the cases were draped in U.S. flags.

At one point in his remarks, the vice president pointedly said ""we trust"" the remains belong to ""American heroes who fell in the Korean War.""

""Some have called the Korean War the 'forgotten war,'"" Pence said. ""But today, we prove these heroes were never forgotten. Today, our boys are coming home.""

There are 7,699 U.S. service members listed as unaccounted for from the 1950-53 Korean War, of which about 5,300 are believed to have died on North Korean soil. The remainder are those who died in South Korea but have not been recovered; those who died in air crashes at sea or on ships at sea, and some believed to have been taken to China.

An armistice that ended the Korean War has yet to be replaced with a peace treaty, leaving the peninsula in a technical state of war. North Korea has argued steadfastly that its nuclear weapons are meant to neutralize alleged U.S. plans to attack it.

Efforts to recover remains in North Korea have been fraught with political and other obstacles since the war's end. Between 1990 and 1994, North Korea unilaterally handed over 208 caskets to the U.S., which turned out to contain remains of far more than 208 individuals, although forensics specialists thus far have established 181 identities.

A series of U.S.-North Korean recovery efforts, termed ""joint field activities,"" between 1996 and 2005 yielded 229 caskets of remains, of which 153 have been identified, according to the Pentagon.

"Former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona detailed on Sunday the remarkable life of the late Sen. John McCain, recalling the lawmaker’s decades of service to the United States while downplaying talk that he could fill McCain’s seat.



“He was the conscience of the Senate,” Kyl said during an interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Kyl, who served alongside McCain, R-Ariz., in the Senate from 1995 until 2013, was named to the shortlist of potential candidates to be appointed to McCain’s seat by Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. Along with Kyl, The Arizona Republic has listed McCain’s widow, Cindy, Ducey’s chief of staff, Kirk Adams, and the former U.S. ambassador to Finland, Barbara Barrett, as potential appointees to replace the late lawmaker.

Kyl noted that whoever is appointed to fill McCain’s seat will have big shoes to fill, especially when it comes to national security and international relations.

“[McCain’s] legacy is his commitment to national security,” Kyl said. “It was there that he made the most difference.”

“They key thing,” Kyl added about McCain’s replacement, “is to represent the state of Arizona, but also continue to represent all the people of the United States on an international level.”

McCain died Saturday after battling brain cancer for more than a year. He was 81.

The scion of a decorated military family, McCain embraced his role as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, pushing for aggressive U.S. military intervention overseas and eager to contribute to ""defeating the forces of radical Islam that want to destroy America.""

The son and grandson of Navy admirals, McCain is a former Navy pilot. He was elected to Congress in 1982 and to the Senate four years later, replacing the retiring Barry Goldwater.

Despite his famous stubborn streak and occasional ornery nature, McCain is widely admired on both sides of the aisle, and tributes poured in Friday after the family announced McCain's decision to stop treatment for brain cancer.

""We are so fortunate to call him our friend and colleague,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Twitter. McCain, his wife Cindy ""and the entire McCain family are in our prayers at this incredibly difficult hour,"" McConnell said.

Ducey called McCain ""an American hero"" who always put his country before himself.

A ""spirt of service and civility"" guided McCain's life, standing as a model for Americans regardless of political affiliation, Ducey said.

Asked how he wanted to be remembered shortly before his death, McCain said simply: ""That I made a major contribution to the defense of the nation.""

One dramatic vote he cast in the twilight of his career in 2017 will not soon be forgotten, either: As the decisive ""no"" on Senate GOP legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, McCain became the unlikely savior of Obama's trademark legislative achievement.

Taking a long look back in his valedictory memoir, ""The Restless Wave,"" McCain wrote of the world he inhabited: ""I hate to leave it. But I don't have a complaint. Not one. It's been quite a ride. I've known great passions, seen amazing wonders, fought in a war, and helped make a peace. ... I made a small place for myself in the story of America and the history of my times.""

U.S. Army Gen. Austin Scott Miller assumed command of the 41-nation NATO mission in Afghanistan in a handover ceremony on Sunday.

Miller took over from Gen. John Nicholson, who held the post for more than two years, at a ceremony at NATO headquarters in Kabul attended by senior Afghan officials and foreign ambassadors.

The handover comes as Afghan forces are struggling to contain a resurgent Taliban and an increasingly powerful Islamic State affiliate. The Taliban control several districts across Afghanistan, and both groups have launched a relentless wave of attacks in recent months.

""The world recognizes Afghanistan cannot be a safe haven for terrorism, the world recognizes that we cannot fail. I know this has been a long fight, and it has been generations for us, for the Afghan people,"" said Miller, who most recently led the Joint Special Operations Command.

Nicholson called on the Taliban to accept the government's offer of a cease-fire and renewed peace negotiations, saying ""you don't need to keep killing your fellow Afghans.""

The nearly 17-year-old NATO mission began with the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks. The U.S. and NATO formally ended their combat mission in 2014 but still routinely come to the aid of Afghan forces.

Afghanistan's national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, acknowledged the setbacks, saying ""we have a bloody nose, but we are not defeated.""

Also Sunday, at least four people were wounded after their vehicle was detonated by a sticky bomb in the capital Kabul, according to Nasrat Rahimi, deputy spokesman for the Interior Ministry.

Rahimi said the blast took place near the capital's diplomatic area. ""All four wounded people were transferred to hospital and they are not in a life-threatening condition,"" he said.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in Kabul, but both Taliban insurgents and Islamic states militants are active and have claimed earlier attacks in Kabul.",world
"Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia, a Republican who spent most of the past 12 years building up political chits under two different GOP governors, expected to become governor himself this year.

But last week President Trump endorsed Cagle’s opponent, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, in Tuesday’s runoff for the Republican gubernatorial nomination – and Kemp won in a landslide.

With 99.9 percent of precincts reporting, Kemp became the state's Republican gubernatorial nominee with 69.5 percent of the vote – while Cagle captured only 30.5 percent.

Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in Georgia over the weekend for Kemp. And now – despite the prognostications of some pundits – Kemp is the odds-on favorite to win election as Georgia’s next governor in November. He will face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who hopes to become the first female African-American governor in the nation.

Trump tweeted on Kemp’s behalf, including one saying: “Brian Kemp, who is running for Governor of Georgia and has my full endorsement, is campaigning tonight with VP @mike_pence. Brian is very strong on Crime and Borders. LOVES our Military. Vets and the 2nd Amendment. He will be a GREAT Governor!”

That and similar presidential tweets no doubt were persuasive.

Trump’s endorsement alone may not be enough to carry any candidate to victory. In the races where it has appeared to make a difference, it has come as late as Election Day.

But with the president enjoying overwhelming favorability among Republican voters -- 88 percent job approval, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released this week -- it’s clear that, in the primary at least, it is better to have him on your side than against you.

Though he started the race with the highest name recognition of any candidate on the GOP side in a multi-candidate field and the backing of outgoing Republican Gov. Nathan Deal and the National Rifle Association, Cagle couldn’t pull off a win.

Normally, those endorsements – merging the support of the powerful and entrenched interests dominating the scene in the state Capitol in Atlanta with the Second Amendment enthusiasm common to rural Georgians – should have been enough for Cagle to romp to victory.

Instead it was Kemp -- who based his campaign on Trump-like themes like the need to crack down on “criminal illegals” -- who prevailed.

Another factor was a leaked audiotape in which, as Fox News’ Gregg Re reported, Cagle could be heard saying he “helped pass a ‘bad public-policy bill’ for political gain.” The tape focused attention on Cagle’s ties to the political establishment in Atlanta that, like the establishment Trump faces in Washington, is out of favor with many Republican voters.

The gubernatorial runoff race was not without its ups and downs, but things likely turned more on voters’ perceptions of the two candidates and which one would fight harder on behalf of their interests.

The campaign was also not without moments of levity, such as when disgraced GOP state Rep. Jason Spencer – who had already been defeated in his bid for renomination – appeared literally with his pants down on entertainer Sasha Baron Cohen’s new television program.

Spencer had endorsed Kemp. The Cagle campaign attempted without success to make an issue out of Spencer’s use of a racial slur against black people on Cohen’s TV show and his other shocking behavior, but the voters wouldn’t bite.

There were also two Democratic runoffs for congressional seats in the state. Lucy McBath defeated Kevin Abel in the 6th District, and Carolyn Bourdeaux defeated David Kim in the 7th District.

While Kemp walked away with the GOP gubernatorial nomination, President Trump came out a winner as well, showing that he has the political clout to move the electorate to his favored candidate. That must have been welcome news for the president.",politics
"This Fourth of July, many Americans are spun up, protesting against President Trump with a long list of grievances – most recently his plans to appoint a conservative justice to the Supreme Court, as well as his immigration policies, his foreign policy, his trade policy, his tweeting … his everything.

Calls for the president’s impeachment grow louder from the self-styled Resistance – increasingly strident folks on the left, some proudly calling themselves socialists – who act as if they are fighting a tyrannical enemy nation occupying the White House. They may have seen one too many films about occupied Europe in World War II.

Trump administration officials are harassed at restaurants, movie theaters and their homes. And don’t forget that just a year ago, a gunman attacked Republican members of Congress at a baseball practice and severely wounded Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., almost taking his life.

Underlying much of this angst and anger is a mistaken belief that the federal government is all that matters. But in reality, this isn’t true.

Let me review what we all should have learned in school. Power is not all concentrated in the hands of our elected president, Congress and the federal courts. Importantly, we have state and local governments that share power as well, all led by people the voters elect.

The Founding Fathers designed our system this way in the Constitution for a very important reason: liberty is elusive in a large land with a diverse population if government power is centralized and monopolized in Washington.

The United States of America made its Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4, 1776. More than a mere document, the declaration launched the American project, giving our nation this mission statement:

“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.”

The implementation of “unalienable Rights” for all Americans (black people, women and Native Americans were regrettably excluded for many years) required a horrific Civil War and several amendments to the Constitution to be realized. But our form of government is, at its core, designed to foster “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”

Some political matters require a national standard. For instance, after the Supreme Court’s infamous Dred Scott decision in 1857, essentially upholding the practice of slavery and denying citizenship to black people, Abraham Lincoln observed: “A house divided against itself, cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free.”

Similarly, after the Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision in 2015 regarding same-sex marriage, there is no going back – contracts must be honored across state lines.

This still leaves an enormous amount of room for Americans to seek their preferred form of government at the state level.

People have rights, states have powers. Among the powers allotted to states are the ability to tax, spend, regulate and set laws for punishing crimes.

If the voters of California and New York want high taxes and big government, they may elect to do so. But if people in Texas and Florida prefer no income tax and smaller government, then that should be fine as well.

More importantly, people in California and New York ought to let their fellow Americans in other states live as they wish. The left-leaning, big-government states shouldn’t seek to wield the power of the national government – including its vast regulatory bureaucracy and the courts – to force other parts of the nation to live like California and New York.

It is the mistaken notion of virtually limitless federal government power that has caused today’s so-called Resistance to become unhinged. Similarly, the exercise of this crushing federal power provoked the fed-up reaction that boosted voter turnout for Donald Trump in the 2016 election in states that hadn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate in decades.

It comes back to rights. The founders believed in rights that didn’t require the labor or taxes of others to be fulfilled. We have a right to free speech, to practice of our religion, and to bear arms. We don’t have the right to expect that taxpayer funds will be used to provide us a computer and Internet access, a place to worship, or a rifle.

Similarly, we don’t have a right to free food, free housing, a free college education, free health care, free cars, and more freebies supplied by the government thanks to the labor and hard-earned cash of others.

Getting all these things for free may at first sound like heaven on Earth – a Bernie Sanders utopia. But if this socialist dream ever became reality, it would turn out to be a nightmare. It would send everyone’s taxes soaring through the roof and create a tremendous disincentive to work – meaning taxes would have to be raised even higher on those people who still held jobs. There would be shortages of just about everything.

Think I’m exaggerating? Just look at the economic basket cases of Cuba and North Korea today, or the old Soviet Union, China and Eastern European nations in the years before limited free-market reforms took effect. In all these cases, powerful and unchecked central governments set rigid national policies that crippled economies and wiped out personal freedoms.

The genius of the American system is to not leave all governmental power with the federal government. Instead, we allow states to function as laboratories of democracy.

The 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence made it clear that they saw the King of England’s far-away rule resulting in “a long train of abuses” with the “direct object (being) the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.”

Today’s federal government frequently appears to have similar designs, with unelected bureaucrats in Washington setting policy for the whole nation, depriving voters in the states of self-determination through their elected state representatives.

On this Independence Day, let us resolve to turn our attention to our families, our communities, and our states, declaring independence from a distant and often unresponsive federal government.

Our national motto, “E pluribus unum” – out of the many, one – speaks to a paradox in this light. By allowing the many states room to formulate their own solutions using the democratic process, we can more readily unify into one America.

We celebrate this all on Independence Day.",politics
"Prosecutors on Friday charged the father and stepmother of a 3-year-old boy whose body was found at a ramshackle compound in northern New Mexico with child abuse charges that can carry a penalty of life in prison.

Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his partner Jany Leveille are accused of failing to provide medication to a son of Wahhaj's who had a severe medical condition that was well known to the family, according to charges of child abuse resulting in death and conspiracy to commit child abuse filed by the district attorney's office in Taos.

Wahhaj is the father of Abdul-ghani Wahhaj, whose remains were discovered inside an underground tunnel at a compound near the Colorado state line.

The defendants were among five adults and 11 children found living in squalor during an Aug. 3 raid on the compound. The boy's remains were found three days later.

A lawyer for Siraj Ibn Wahhaj did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Kelly Golightley, an attorney for Leveille, said she had not seen the charges or accompanying warrant and that her client maintains her innocence.

Leveille also is being held on accusations by federal immigration authorities that she overstayed her non-immigrant visitor visa after arriving 20 years ago in the United States from her native Haiti. She was returned Thursday to Taos from a federal holding facility in Texas.

The boy initially was reported missing last year from Jonesboro, Georgia, by his mother, Hakima Ramzi, after Wahhaj said he was taking the child to a park and didn't return.

In an affidavit accompanying the new charges, prosecutors outlined allegations that Wahhaj and his son left Georgia without taking medications the boy needed to treat severe health problems, including seizures that stemmed from a lack of oxygen and blood flow at birth.

The affidavit alleges that Leveille and Wahhaj witnessed the boy's seizures and knew he had a diagnosed seizure disorder but apparently provided no medication and took no action to seek proper medical care.

Prosecutors quote an extensive account of the child's death as written in a journal entry that they attribute to Leveille, indicating that Abdul-ghani died in late December 2017 as the exhausted boy's heartbeat faded in and out during a religious ritual accompanied by a reading of the Quran and aimed at casting out demonic spirits.

The ritual and the boy's death were described at earlier court hearings by an FBI agent who drew on information from interviews with teenagers who lived at the compound. The descriptions conform with aspects of an alternative, meditative Islamic healing ritual called ruqya.

The New Mexico Office of Medical Inspector has not yet determined how Abdul-ghani died. Spokeswoman Alex Sanchez said Friday that the agency is performing analyses.

All five defendants arrested at the compound have been charged with child neglect and are being held in jail.

Also Friday, prosecutors filed a lengthy appeal of a district judge's order that could allow at least three of the defendants to be released on house arrest with ankle monitors.

Prosecutors have alleged that older children were trained to handle firearms to possibly order attacks on government institutions.

Judge Sarah Backus said the previous evidence provided by prosecutors was troubling but did not indicate any clear threat to public safety from the defendants, who have no criminal records.

That decision led to death threats against the judge and outraged calls from politicians — including New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and candidates vying to succeed her — to reconsider recent reforms to the state's bail procedures.",world
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s grandparents and great grandparents came to America from Italy because they thought America was a great country – a place to build better futures. My ancestors came to America from Africa against their will, in chains and enslaved, treated as less than human.

So it’s ironic that Cuomo could say last week: “We’re not going to make America great again. It was never that great.” Yet I say America is the greatest nation on Earth and has been since its founding.

America is not perfect, certainly – but it has many fewer flaws today than it had in the past. And we are on the path to becoming ever greater for a lot of reasons, including the leadership of President Trump.

Cuomo said Wednesday: “We have not reached greatness, we will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged, we will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51 percent of our population, is gone and every woman’s full potential is realized and unleashed and every woman is making her full contribution.”

Well, as someone who has a lot more experience than Andrew Cuomo being a woman, I say that women obviously still face discrimination. But again, the opportunities open to us today far exceed opportunities for my mother, grandmother and earlier generations.

Two days after his original comments – in face of much criticism, even from Democrats and the media – Cuomo realized he’d stuck his foot in his mouth and backpedaled, saying: “Of course America is great and of course America has always been great.” Right. Too bad the Democratic governor didn’t say this in the first place.

Cuomo then launched into – what else? – an attack on President Trump, who Democrats seem to believe is the root of all evil. As if President Trump created slavery, racism, discrimination against women, and all the other problems that existed in this great country long before he was born.

I realize Gov. Cuomo’s ancestors came here poor, with little education and money, not speaking English, facing discrimination. No disrespect intended to those good and hardworking people, but my ancestors had it a lot harder – not just during the days of slavery, but in the years of blatant racism that followed and into our current times.

So why am I more positive than the governor of New York about our great country and our future?

Because while I believe America has never been perfect, I know it has always been a great nation – striving for the ideals of liberty and equality even when it failed to live up to those ideals. And we’re getting better all the time in matching our actions with the words of the Declaration of Independence and other statements of our highest aspirations.

America is perfectly imperfect. Our nation’s Founding Fathers were flawed. Today, you and I are flawed. Tomorrow, our children and our grandchildren and great grandchildren will be flawed. Mistakes will be made. Miscalculations will occur. Hindsight will always be 20-20.

I recently finished reading the book “An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves and the Creation of America,” by Henry Wiencek. To say this book was challenging to read would be an understatement. It tapped into my every emotion.

At times as I read this book I cried. At other times I was inspired. Most times I was infuriated. Seldom did I laugh. It was an unvarnished look at slavery and our first president, George Washington – a great but deeply flawed man.

President Washington is probably the most honored man in American history. He was a brilliant general in the Revolutionary War and a great president. He was a patriot revered by our nation. He was a moral man, except … when it came to the sin of slavery.

There’s a fair amount of documentation that shows Washington had misgivings about owning other human beings as if they were livestock. Yet he lacked the moral conviction and courage to fight to abolish slavery when it was directly within his power to do so.

Washington only acknowledged the evil of slavery in death, when in his last will and testament he freed some of his slaves and said the rest should be freed upon his wife’s death.

Many would point to Washington’s role as a slave owner as proof that – as Andrew Cuomo said – America “was never that great.” The critics could also point to many other sorry episodes in our history – the mistreatment of Native Americans, denying women the right to vote until 1920 and many rights long after that, and on and on.

In the creation of America, our Founding Fathers spoke and wrote about a perfection that they themselves never fully achieved. Yet the beauty of the Declaration of Independence and the genius within the Constitution was that they raised the bar on what America should be.

Our founders could have easily set the bar low and patted each other on the back and given each other “attaboys.” But they didn’t.

So much of our culture today is fixated on constantly lowering the bar of expectations so that everyone feels better about themselves. To the contrary, our founders raised the bar for the entire country, themselves and future generations. They dreamed of a better society and we are the beneficiaries of their efforts.

And today each generation gets the wonderful opportunity to move the needle a little bit farther towards more freedom, equality, unity and yes, even more greatness. None of us will be around 200 years from now, but I have no doubt that America will be an even greater country then.

Our time to impact our world will come and go. Then our children will pick up the mantle to have their crack at self-governance. Yet I fear the examples we are modeling before our children will come back to haunt them. Our manipulative techniques of getting what we want, the downright violent and disagreeable way in which we discuss issues, and our utter disrespect for authority will be hurdles. I fear the next generation will be ill-equipped to overcome these.

There are pockets of fellow Americans scattered throughout our nation who are bitter and mean. Then there is the rest of us. Our founders faced this dichotomy as well. Let us do as they did, raising the bar for all of us.

Let us set the bar just high enough that we always stretch to reach it and never quite make it, but strive ever harder. Let us do more to better understand people who don’t see the world as we do, look like us, pray like us, or live like us. Let us practice humility and assume that others have something to teach us. Let us agree to disagree when we must, and disagree without being disagreeable.

Above all, let us believe that all people – in the words of the Declaration of Independence – are “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”

This is how we move the needle farther beyond our founders, who were sadly incapable of respecting the worth of all fellow human beings. Fellow human beings like slaves, who struggled to prove their worth as they fought in the American Revolution to achieve a freedom that was not even their own.

And this is how we will make our great country even greater.",politics
"A co-owner of a restaurant that refused to serve White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Friday reportedly cited morality and living up to ""certain standards,” as the reason why.

Stephanie Wilkinson recalled the moments leading up to the encounter in an interview with the Washington Post, starting with a phone conversation she had with an employee, who revealed that Sanders was dining at the Red Hen in Lexington, Va.

After her chef reportedly told her that “the staff is a little concerned,” Wilkinson left her home and headed for the restaurant.

“I’m not a huge fan of confrontation,” Wilkinson told the Post. “I have a business, and I want the business to thrive.”

SARAH SANDERS SAYS SHE WAS THROWN OUT OF VIRGINIA RESTAURANT BECAUSE SHE WORKS FOR TRUMP

“This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals,” she continued. She also reportedly described the actions of Trump’s White House as “inhumane and unethical.”

“This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.” - Stephanie Wilkinson, co-owner, Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Va.

After arriving, Wilkinson recalled to the Post that Sanders’ party had some appetizers on the table, but had not yet received their entrees. She said she spoke to her employees, asking them how they wanted her to move forward.

“I can ask her to leave,” she suggested to the staff, according to the Post.

“Yes,” the employees replied.

Wilkinson then told the Post that she approached Sanders, introduced herself, then asked Sanders to “come out to the patio” to talk.

“I was babbling a little, but I got my point across in a polite and direct fashion,” Wilkinson told the Post. “I explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion, and cooperation,” before saying, “I’d like to ask you to leave.”

She reportedly said the press secretary replied simply by saying “That’s fine. I’ll go,” before she and her entire party left the restaurant.

Wilkinson told the Post that the Sanders group had “offered to pay,” but Wilkinson declined, telling them that there was no charge for their order.

Following the exchange, TMZ reported that Sanders was kicked out of the restaurant on “moral grounds” and cited a waiter who said that Sanders was served “for a total of two minutes before my owner kicked her out along with seven of her other family members.”

Sanders confirmed the events on Twitter, saying she was told to leave by the owner because she worked for the president.

“Her actions say far more about her than about me,” she tweeted. “I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so.”

Looking back, Wilkinson told the Post, she ""would have done the same thing again.""

Meanwhile, an unaffiliated restaurant in Washington, also called the Red Hen, was working to convince customers that it was not involved in the Sanders dispute, which took place in Virginia.

"Former FBI Director James Comey waded back into the political fray on Twitter Sunday, warning Democrats not to ""rush to the socialist left"" in upcoming elections.

""Democrats, please, please don’t lose your minds,"" Comey wrote. ""This president and his Republican Party are counting on you to do exactly that. America's great middle wants sensible, balanced, ethical leadership.""

Last week, Comey urged voters to back Democrats in November's midterm elections, tweeting that Republicans had proven ""incapable of fulfilling the Founders’ design that 'Ambition must … counteract ambition.'""

Comey's latest tweet appeared to be a response to the rise of New York City congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old former bartender who defeated House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley in a primary last month.

Since then Ocasio-Cortez has emerged as a star of the so-called ""democratic socialist"" movement, having made several media appearances and campaigned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in support of primary challengers.

The Democratic Socialists of America has endorsed 42 candidates for office at the federal, state and local levels in 20 states --including Florida, Hawaii, Kansas and Michigan.

Allie Cohn, a member of the DSA's national political team, told The Associated Press this weekend that the group's paid membership has reached 45,000 nationwide. In the years before President Trump's election, that number hovered around 6,000.

The most ambitious Democrats in Washington have been reluctant to embrace the label, even as they embrace the policies defining modern-day democratic socialism: Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, free college tuition and the abolition of the federal department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE.

Republicans, meanwhile, are encouraged by the rise of democratic socialism — for a far different reason. They have seized on what they view as a leftward lurch by Democrats they predict will alienate voters this fall and in the 2020 presidential race.

The Republican National Committee eagerly notes that Sanders' plan to provide free government-sponsored health care for all Americans had no co-sponsors in 2013. Today, more than one-third of Senate Democrats and two-thirds of House Democrats have signed onto the proposal, which by one estimate could cost taxpayers as much as $32 trillion.

The co-sponsors include some 2020 presidential prospects, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and California Sen. Kamala Harris.

Those senators aren't calling themselves democratic socialists but also not disassociating themselves from the movement's priorities.

Most support the push to abolish ICE, which enforces immigration laws and led the Trump administration's recent push to separate immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Of the group, only Booker hasn't called for ICE to be abolished, replaced or rebuilt. Yet Booker's office notes that he's among the few senators backing a plan to guarantee government-backed jobs to unemployed adults in high-unemployment communities across America.

""Embracing socialist policies like government-run health care, a guaranteed jobs program and open borders will only make Democrats more out of touch,"" RNC Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel said.

"Republicans gearing up for the upcoming midterms were handed a powerful weapon on Friday as they start to head home to begin the campaign for re-elections -- a booming economy.

The Commerce Department announced Friday that the economy grew by 4.1 percent in the second quarter of 2018, making it the fastest economic expansion in almost four years.

GDP REPORT SHOWS BOOMING 4.1 PERCENT GROWTH, AS TRUMP TOUTS 'AMAZING' NUMBERS



The White House hailed the numbers as an indication that tax cuts, deregulation and tough trade practices have paid off.



“We’ve accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions,” President Trump declared. “Once again, we are the economic envy of the entire world.”



The numbers come at a crucial time for Republicans. Lawmakers in the House, which is seen as most likely to flip in November, broke for recess this week, and are heading home to an electoral outlook that suggests a “blue wave” could be in the offing for Democrats.



Sabato’s Crystal Ball, part of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, is now predicting that the race for the House tilts toward the Democrats and that they are now “a little better than 50-50 to win the House” -- the first time it has made such a prediction. It also made 17 House ratings changes -- all in favor of the Democrats.



Additionally, a Quinnipiac University Poll found that Democrats have opened a 12-point lead on the generic House ballot -- a gap that Republicans had almost closed just a few months ago.



In Washington, President Trump has been dogged by revelations about former attorney Michael Cohen’s payments to women who claimed they had affairs with Trump, as well as a troubled European trip in which he was widely criticized for appearing to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin’s claims that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 election. Trump later walked back some of his comments



The economic numbers give Republicans a chance to refocus attention away from the Russia investigation and back onto claims that they are delivering on bread-and-butter issues. They will be hoping that the old addage from former Clinton strategist James Carville -- “it’s the economy, stupid” -- will still be true in 2018.



Republicans quickly took advantage of the numbers on Friday, hailing them as proof that Republican policies on tax and regulations are working.



“This is yet another indication that our economy is surging, and Americans are better off now,” House Speaker Paul Ryan’s, R-Wis., office said in a press release, a nod to the House GOP slogan: “Better Off Now.”

“The voters will have a choice this November, do you want more jobs and higher wages or would you rather have more government and higher taxes, which is what the Democrats are selling?” Rep. Keith Rothfus, R-Pa., said on “Fox News @ Night.”



It also complicates matters for Democrats, who under the banner of “For the People”, are looking to pivot to a message focused more on economics rather than a strictly anti-Trump platform.



Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, took a stab at a more populist economic pushback on the economy numbers Friday, arguing in a thread on Twitter that it only benefited the rich and big corporations.



“The GOP promised their tax bill would be “rocket fuel” for the economy. Instead, it blew up the deficit by a trillion dollars & sparked a surge in stock buybacks, benefiting the biggest corps, their execs & wealthy shareholders while leaving middle-class families largely behind,” he tweeted, before asking: “So. Where’s your raise?”



But such a platform is fraught with dangers. With a booming economy resulting just months after the Trump tax cuts, a platform of rolling back those tax cuts could be dangerous for Democrats.



Republicans were delighted in May when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., suggested Democrats would roll back the Trump tax cuts if they took control of the House.

PELOSI SAYS DEMS WILL WORK TO ROLL BACK TRUMP TAX CUTS IF THEY RETAKE CONGRESS



""I do think we should revisit the tax legislation in a way that we always have, in a bipartisan, transparent way that the result is unifying for the country,” she said.



National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Matt Gorman jumped on Pelosi's comment, tweeting: ""I promise you that will be in almost every GOP ad this fall.""

"John McCain, who has been battling an aggressive form of brain cancer for more than a year, doesn’t want President Trump to attend his funeral and prefers Vice President Pence to be there, according to a New York Times report.

In addition, former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have been asked to deliver eulogies at McCain's funeral, sources close to both former presidents and McCain told CNN.

The 81-year-old Arizona senator underwent surgery for an intestinal infection recently and was joined at his ranch by his daughter Meghan over the weekend. Last July, McCain was diagnosed with glioblastoma, the same rare and aggressive brain cancer that killed Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy and former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Beau.

“I don’t know how much longer I’ll be here,” McCain said in an audio excerpt of his forthcoming memoir, The Restless Wave, as NPR reports. The senator is also the subject of a nearly two-hour HBO documentary.

Biden spent 90 minutes at the ailing senator’s Arizona ranch last Sunday.

“Here John knows he’s in a very, very, very precarious situation, and yet he’s still concerned about the state of the country,” Biden told the Times. “We talked about how our international reputation is being damaged and we talked about the need for people to stand up and speak out.”

According to the Times, McCain’s closest family members have informed the White House that the current plan for his funeral is for Pence to attend the service to be held in Washington’s National Cathedral, but not Trump — with whom McCain has not had the greatest relationship.

The Arizona senator, who was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, cast a crucial vote against the repeal of ObamaCare in July, singlehandedly scuttling one of the Trump administration's major policy goals, a move that provoked the ire of Trump but earned him a thank you call from Obama.

Back in July of 2015, Trump attacked McCain for the five and a half years spent in a notorious Vietnamese prison where he was tortured, telling voters in Iowa:

“He’s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”

In his book, McCain doesn’t pull any punches about Trump.

“He seems uninterested in the moral character of world leaders and their regimes,” he writes of the president, according to the Times, which obtained a copy of the book. “The appearance of toughness or a reality show facsimile of toughness seems to matter more than any of our values. Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity.”

Among other things, McCain reportedly uses his new book to express regret for not choosing former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, who recently visited McCain at his ranch, as his vice presidential running mate in 2008.

His advisers apparently told him that Lieberman’s pro-choice views could divide GOP voters. McCain ended up picking then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was mocked for a number of unforced errors and gaffes during the campaign.

Former Sen. Robert Dole, who wore McCain’s POW bracelet while his future colleague was in the camp known as “Hanoi Hilton,” told the Times he planned to tell McCain in a coming phone call, “You’re a tough guy and you can overcome this.”

“I’d like to see us recover our sense that we’re more alike than different,” McCain says in audio excerpts from the book reported by NPR.",politics
"The founder of Afghanistan's much-feared Haqqani network, a former U.S. ally turned fierce enemy, has died after years of ill health, a Taliban spokesman said Tuesday. Jalaluddin Haqqani was 72.

Haqqani died Monday inside Afghanistan, Zabihullah Mujahed told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. The elderly founder of the outlawed Afghanistan-based organization, once hailed as a freedom fighter by U.S. President Ronald Reagan, had been paralyzed for the past 10 years.

In announcing his death Tuesday, Mujahed called Haqqani a religious scholar and exemplary warrior.

Because of his infirmity, Haqqani's network has been led by his son Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is also deputy head of the Taliban. Considered the most formidable of the Taliban's fighting forces, the Haqqani network has been linked to some of the more audacious attacks in Afghanistan. The elder Haqqani joined the Taliban when they overran Kabul in September 1996, expelling feuding mujahedeen groups, whose battles left the capital in ruins.

Since then, the network has been among the fiercest foes fighting U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan.

Haqqani was among the Afghan mujahedeen, or holy warriors, the United States backed in the 1980s to fight the former Soviet Union's invading army, sent to Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the pro-Moscow government. Haqqani was praised by the late U.S. Congressman Charlie Wilson as ""goodness personified."" After 10 years, Moscow negotiated an exit from Afghanistan in an agreement that eventually led to the collapse of Kabul's communist government and a takeover by the mujahedeen.

In 2012 the United States declared the Haqqani network a terrorist organization. Haqqani had not been heard from in several years and reports of his death were widespread in 2015.

Declassified U.S. cables called Haqqani a ""moderate socialist"" who did not embrace the Taliban's strict rules that denied girls education. ""Haqqani functions more in the military area, and is not a force in setting Taliban political or social issues,"" the cables read.

Born in 1947 into the powerful Zardran tribe that dominates southeastern Afghanistan's Paktia, Paktika and Khost provinces, Haqqani was a close friend of Osama bin Laden, who often took refuge in his camps outside Khost.

The father of 12 sons, the ailing Haqqani — who had been suffering from Parkinson disease for several years prior to his death — had turned the day-to-day military campaign over to his son Sirajuddin.

The elder Haqqani's association with Pakistan dates back to his early years, when he studied a deeply conservative form of Islam at the Darulaman Haqqania madrassa, or religious school, in northwest Pakistan. In an earlier interview with The Associated Press, the school's top cleric Maulana Sami-ul-Haq, recalled a studious Haqqani.

It was Haqqani's rigid interpretation of Islam that launched him on the road to insurgency in the early 1970s when he returned to Afghanistan to open a madrassa, or religious school, and organized a movement against Afghanistan's monarch, King Zahir Shah, according to unclassified U.S. documents that tracked Haqqani's militant career from the early 1970s to his partnership with the Taliban in 1996.

Forced to leave Afghanistan because of his agitation against the monarchy, which was eventually overthrown, Haqqani set up a madrassa in Miran Shah, in Pakistan's North Waziristan.

During the 1980s, when Washington backed an uprising against the communist government in Kabul and its Russian allies, it was Haqqani's military prowess that brought him attention from both the United States and Pakistan. He received both money and weapons from the U.S.

While the Soviet Union poured men and money into Afghanistan to support the Communist government in Kabul, Pakistan, the United States and several Arab states including Saudi Arabia and Egypt, stockpiled weapons for the mujahedeen in neighboring Pakistan. Suitcases full of cash were delivered to the mujahedeen through Pakistan, according to a former CIA chief, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He told The AP he personally delivered suitcases full of money to Haqqani, whom he described as ""one of the good ones.""

It was during the 1980s that fighters from the Muslim world were recruited to fight the invading communists in Afghanistan. Bin Laden was among the first to sign up. Many of the Arab fighters gravitated toward Haqqani because he was an Arabic speaker and a ferocious warrior.

Many of the Arab fighters, who remain in Afghanistan, including the new head of al-Qaida Ayman al Zawahri, are believed to be protected by the Haqqani network, which it is believed they also help fund.

Haqqani developed close ties with Pakistan's intelligence service known by the acronym ISI as well as Pakistani militant groups, many of whom were being groomed by the ISI to fight neighbor India in the disputed Kashmir region.

After the Russians left and Afghanistan's communist government fell to the U.S.-backed mujahedeen, Haqqani served briefly as justice minister. He soon abandoned the mujahedeen government frustrated by their relentless feuding and returned to Khost where he maintained close contact with militants, including bin Laden, from Arabic speaking countries.

After taking power in September 1996, the Taliban embraced Haqqani for his military skills, according to a declassified 1998 cable from the U.S. Embassy. That cable also said Haqqani ""is close buddies with many Arab and Pakistani Islamists.""

In August 1998, U.S. cruise missiles targeted Haqqani's base in a failed attempt to kill bin Laden. Several Pakistani militants affiliated with the Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen group were killed in that attack.

In November 2001, when the Taliban were routed from Kabul, Haqqani was ordered by Mullah Omar to move the Arab fighters to safety.

Haqqani had proven to be among the most resilient of Afghanistan's insurgents.

"Hundreds of military service members and private contractors who had dozens of class-action lawsuits thrown out by a court of appeals are refusing to give up the fight.

Just last month, a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a federal judge in Maryland, who last year threw out the lawsuits brought against KBR, a former Halliburton Corp. subsidiary. The panel found that the military had unrestricted control over KBR, rendering company decisions on waste management and water services ""de facto military decisions"" not appropriate for judicial review.

It was a crushing blow to those who filed the original class-action lawsuits, who maintain they were made ill by the use of open-air burn pits. On Tuesday, attorneys representing them filed a motion for the court of appeals to conduct an “en banc” review -- in which a case is heard before all judges of a court as opposed to the panel that made last month’s decision.

“The panel acknowledged the district court’s finding that the evidence established that the military determined that hazardous materials were ‘to be segregated and disposed of by a method other than surface burning’ and were ‘not authorized to be placed in burn pits,’” reads a copy of the motion obtained by Fox News. “Yet the panel held that the district court did not clearly err when it wholly discounted both the evidence (sworn declarations) and the allegations in the complaint.""

More than 60 lawsuits allege that KBR's practice of dumping tires, batteries, medical waste and other materials into open burn pits created harmful smoke that caused neurological problems, cancers and other health issues in more than 800 service members.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs maintain in this recent motion that the evidence against KBR, about improper waste disposal methods at military bases during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is hard to ignore.

“The panel’s decision cannot be squared with the evidentiary record, which establishes that KBR burned batteries and other hazardous materials in burn pits on thousands of instances,” reads another passage in the motion. “Given that 181 service members filed declarations both in 2011 and 2016, and another 525 service members filed declarations in 2016, the evidentiary record establishing KBR’s systemic burning of hazardous material is substantial and robust.”

The motion further states that a new review should be considered because the original panel’s decision was problematic.

“The panel’s desultory review of the record is all the more problematic because KBR did not rebut this evidence with contradictory submissions. Instead, KBR’s contract manager (David Palmer) admitted that hazardous materials should not have been burned, and testified that KBR was permitted to burn general waste but not hazardous materials.”

During arguments before the 4th Circuit last month, Susan Burke, a lawyer for the service members, argued that KBR repeatedly violated the terms of its contract with the military to handle waste disposal. She said KBR also disobeyed a military directive against burning hazardous materials.

KBR's attorney, Warren Harris, told the court that the decision to use burn pits was made by the military, which also made decisions on where the pits would be located, what hours they would operate and what would be burned in them.

In a recent statement to Fox News, KBR officials say the appeals court decision made last month was crucial in ending a long battle in court.

“KBR is pleased that the Court of Appeals has confirmed that the trial court made the correct decision and that this legacy case is one step closer to final resolution,” reads a statement from officials at the contracting firm. “As KBR has consistently stated, KBR operated burn pits at a very limited number of bases in Iraq and Afghanistan and KBR personnel operated safely and effectively at the direction and under the control of the U.S. military.”

"Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley announced Thursday an investigation into clergy sex crimes within the Roman Catholic Church.

The state’s top attorney will be given “unfettered” access to the records of the Archdiocese of St. Louis, Archbishop Robert Carlson said shortly after Hawley’s announcement.

“Anything that we have we will turn over,” Carlson said.

Word of the investigation came after multiple survivors of clergy sexual abuse protested outside Hawley’s office Wednesday, demanding a statewide probe. The survivors were encouraged by the findings of the grand jury investigation in Pennsylvania that revealed the widespread abuse of more than 1,000 children by 300 predator priests over the last 70 years, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

Hawley’s announcement also came as the Republican is running for a U.S. Senate seat against incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill, with the latest polls showing the candidates virtually deadlocked.

The extent to which sexual abuse by priests exists in the state is unclear as there have been few convictions. But David Clohessy, 61, a longtime victims’ rights advocate in the state who was abused as a child, claims that more than 170 priests in Missouri have been accused in recent decades.

He blamed prosecutors who haven't been “assertive or creative enough in exposing and pursuing these wrongdoers.”

""It would be possible to conduct a thorough and robust investigation of potential clergy abuse if the various dioceses were willing to cooperate,” - Missouri AG Josh Hawley

Hawley said that while the prosecution authority lies with local authorities, his office will investigate the crimes, publish a report and refer the credible cases to the authorities.

“While my office does not have jurisdiction at the present time to prosecute any criminal acts of this nature, or again to issue subpoenas to investigate it, it would be possible to conduct a thorough and robust investigation of potential clergy abuse if the various dioceses were willing to cooperate,” Hawley said.

He added that the Archdiocese of St. Louis “will open to my office their files and allow us to conduct a thorough, impartial review of potential clergy abuse” and invited the state’s other dioceses to “cooperate similarly with this office’s investigation, so that our report can be truly comprehensive and statewide.”

""The majority of the people said, ‘Tell us what you’ve been doing and make sure it is not done by you but by an independent agency.’"" - Archbishop Robert Carlson

The archdiocese opened up its records for state officials after a number of people called on the archbishop to invite an independent review to clear the church’s name.

“The majority of the people said, ‘Tell us what you’ve been doing and make sure it is not done by you but by an independent agency,’” the archbishop said in a news conference. “And it is my feeling that the attorney general would be the appropriate agency to do this. Obviously it’s going to be at arm’s length. We’re going to have to meet and see what their protocols are going to be, but we’re looking forward to that process beginning.”

But other dioceses in Missouri – with the exception of the Diocese of Jefferson City – have yet to follow the suit and open up their records to the state attorney general's office.

The Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph said before the announcement that although it will cooperate “fully with law enforcement and are eager to do so in order to prevent and eliminate dangers to children and vulnerable adults,” it will use its own independent ombudsman who will report accusations of abuse to law enforcement.

“The Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph will cooperate with any review the attorney general requests,” a diocesan spokesman told the Kansas City Star after Hawley’s announcement.

The Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau, according to the Springfield News-Leader, will also launch its own independent inquiry into the abuse by its clergy. The Springfield diocese said it’s aware of nine inactive priests who have faced previously reported credible allegations of abusing a minor and a pastor was recently placed on administrative leave for “sexual misconduct over the Internet.”

Following the release of the Pennsylvania report, Pope Francis promised Monday that “no effort must be spared” to root out clergy sex abuse and cover-up from the church, and begged forgiveness for the pain suffered by victims.

"The FBI on Friday sent a classified letter to House GOP officials disclosing whether the agency used top-secret confidential informants in the Trump campaign prior to opening an investigation into Russian election meddling, Fox News has learned.

Congressional Republicans had formally demanded an explanation from the FBI after numerous former Trump officials said they suspected the agency had attempted to infiltriate the campaign.

In a letter to House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes, R-Calif., obtained by Fox News, the FBI says its confidential explanation outlined whether the ""FBI utilized confidential human sources prior to the issuance of the Electronic Communication initiating that investigation.""

The agency added that it had forwarded House Republicans' request for summaries and transcripts of any conversations between Trump officials and informants to the director of national intelligence.

But Nunes wasn't satisfied with the FBI's reply, and sent a letter to Rosenstein demanding more answers -- including an explanation of how many informants were used, and at what expense -- by Monday evening, Fox News has learned.

TRUMP DEMANDS PROBE OF CAMPAIGN 'SPY'

""There's lots of questions that are unanswered,"" House Judiciary Commitee Chair Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in an exclusive interview on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

GOP Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., echoed that sentiment on Sunday, telling Fox News, ""There is continual bad faith from the FBI and the Department of Justice.""

Allegations that the FBI attempted to infiltrate the Trump campaign prior to the initiation of the formal Russia probe on July 31, 2016, have roiled Washington, amid numerous findings of anti-Trump bias among top officials at the agency.

In one instance, over drinks one evening at a high-end London hotel in the summer of 2016, an alleged FBI informant reportedly asked former Trump adviser George Papadopoulos if he knew anything about Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election.

""If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal,” President Trump tweeted in May.

The FBI also told Nunes it is still working to produce documents pertaining to Christopher Steele, the author of the salacious and unverified Trump dossier.

“Our efforts have resulted in the committees finally getting access to information that was sought months ago, but some important requests remain to be completed,"" AshLee Strong, a spokesperson for House Speaker Paul Ryan, said in a statement.

""Additional time has been requested for the outstanding items, and based on our understanding of the process we believe that request is reasonable,"" Strong added. ""We expect the department to meet its full obligations to the two committees.""

The House Judiciary Committee and House Intelligence Committee have requested more than a million documents from the FBI and DOJ related to the Clinton investigation and surveillance of members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential campaign.

But in a separate letter to the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee last week, also obtained by Fox News, the FBI acknowledged that it still has not fully complied with the subpoenas.

""The FBI continues to diligently and expeditiously collect, review, and process ... materials related to communications between Peter Strzok and personnel in former FBI Deputy Director McCabe's office,"" the FBI's letter to House Oversight Chair Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., and Goodlatte stated.

""Our efforts have resulted in the committees finally getting access to information that was sought months ago."" - AshLee Strong, spokesperson for House Speaker Paul Ryan

Strzok, the FBI agent facing criticism for writing a slew of anti-Trump text messages while he was leading the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices, was subpoenaed to appear before the House Judiciary Committee this week, Fox News confirmed Friday.

FBI AGENT PETER STRZOK 'ESCORTED' FROM FBI BUILDING BY SECURITY

""We have a lot of questions for Mr. Strzok,"" Goodlatte said on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" calling the FBI agent's anti-Trump text messages ""very disturbing.""

""There are a lot of questions"" as to whether the FBI intentionally hid some of the anti-Trump text messages, which were only unearthed by the DOJ watchdog during an independent probe, Goodlatte added.

The FBI's disclosures came days after Gowdy said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., had warned FBI Director Christopher Wray that “there’s going to be action on the floor of the House this week if FBI and DOJ do not comply with our subpoena request.”",politics
"Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team was one holdout juror away from winning a conviction against Paul Manafort on all 18 counts of bank and tax fraud, juror Paula Duncan told Fox News in an exclusive interview Wednesday.

“It was one person who kept the verdict from being guilty on all 18 counts,” Duncan, 52, said. She added that Mueller’s team of prosecutors often seemed bored, apparently catnapping during parts of the trial.

The identities of the jurors have been closely held, kept under seal by Judge T.S. Ellis III at Tuesday's conclusion of the high-profile trial.

But Duncan gave a behind-the-scenes account to Fox News on Wednesday, after the jury returned a guilty verdict against the former Trump campaign chairman on eight financial crime counts and deadlocked on 10 others.

Duncan described herself as an avid supporter of President Trump, but said she was moved by four full boxes of exhibits provided by Mueller’s team – though she was skeptical about prosecutors' motives in the financial crimes case.

“Certainly Mr. Manafort got caught breaking the law, but he wouldn’t have gotten caught if they weren’t after President Trump,” Duncan said of the special counsel’s case, which she separately described as a “witch hunt to try to find Russian collusion,” borrowing a phrase Trump has used in tweets more than 100 times.

“Something that went through my mind is, this should have been a tax audit,” Duncan said, sympathizing with the foundation of the Manafort defense team’s argument.

She described a tense and emotional four days of deliberations, which ultimately left one juror holding out. Behind closed doors, tempers flared at times, even though jurors never explicitly discussed Manafort’s close ties to Trump.

“It was a very emotionally charged jury room – there were some tears,” Duncan said about deliberations with a group of Virginians she didn’t feel included many “fellow Republicans.”

A political allegiance to the president also raised conflicted feelings in Duncan, but she said it ultimately didn’t change her decision about the former Trump campaign chairman.

“Finding Mr. Manafort guilty was hard for me. I wanted him to be innocent, I really wanted him to be innocent, but he wasn’t,” Duncan said. “That’s the part of a juror, you have to have due diligence and deliberate and look at the evidence and come up with an informed and intelligent decision, which I did.”

Duncan, a Missouri native and mother of two, showed Fox News her two notebooks with her juror number #0302 on the covers.

In the interview, Duncan also described how the special counsel’s prosecutors apparently had a hard time keeping their eyes open.

“A lot of times they looked bored, and other times they catnapped – at least two of them did,” Duncan said. “They seemed very relaxed, feet up on the table bars and they showed a little bit of almost disinterest to me, at times.”

The jury box was situated in a corner of the courtroom that gave them an unobstructed head-on view of the prosecutors and defense, while members of the media and the public viewed both parties from behind.

COULD MANAFORT COOPERATE WITH MUELLER'S TEAM? A LOOK AT HIS OPTIONS AFTER THE GUILTY VERDICT

Judge Ellis told jurors, including Duncan, that their names would remain sealed after the trial’s conclusion, because of dangerous threats he received during the proceedings.

But the verdict gave Duncan a license to share her story without fear.

“Had the verdict gone any other way, I might have been,” Duncan said.

MANAFORT CONVICTED ON BANK AND TAX FRAUD CHARGES

Her account of the deliberations is no longer a secret. And neither is the pro-Trump apparel she kept for a long drive to the federal courthouse in Alexandria every day.

“Every day when I drove, I had my Make America Great Again hat in the backseat,” said Duncan, who said she plans to vote for Trump again in 2020. “Just as a reminder.”

"North Korea is possibly constructing new intercontinental ballistic missiles and moving on with “business as usual” for its missile program, an official told Fox News despite Kim Jong Un's claim to halt its weapon production and President Trump’s reassurance that the Hermit Kingdom is “no longer a nuclear threat.”

“It’s business as usual,” a U.S. official with knowledge of the latest intelligence assessment on North Korea told Fox News on Tuesday. The official specifically noted Kim’s regime is pushing forward with building ICBMs — the missiles that caused the North Korea to be placed under heavy sanctions.

The Washington Post first reported Monday that satellite images appear to indicate North Korea is possibly building two ICBMs at the same facility where the country produced its first long-range missiles, including the Hwasong-15 which make have the capability of hitting the U.S. East Coast.

Officials told the newspaper on condition of anonymity that North Korea’s intention was to deceive the U.S. by misconstruing the number of warheads as well as research facilities they have, while claiming they have fully denuclearized.

The intelligence suggested Kim is continuing to build-up his arsenal instead of honoring the commitment he made with Trump last month, the newspaper reported.

“We see them going to work, just as before,” one U.S. official told the paper.

A U.S. official also told Fox News there’s “no evidence” North Korea has halted work on missile development, despite dismantling parts of an engine test site in recent weeks.

Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a Senate panel North Korea continues to produce fissile material needed to make nuclear warheads. Pompeo refuted claims that the U.S. was being played by North Korea.

“I’m afraid that at this point, the United States, the Trump Administration is being taken for a ride,” said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.

“Fear not, senator. Fear not,” advised Pompeo.

The news comes one day before boxes of remains believed to contain some American service members from the Korean War are supposed to arrive in Hawaii from South Korea. A U.S. military aircraft arrived in North Korea last week to pick up the remains.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters Friday its unclear if the remains are American or whether they include French, Australian or other forces, one of the reasons the boxes were delivered in UN flags, not American flags. Officials say positive identification of the remains could take years.

While North Korea honored its promise to return the remains of fallen U.S. soldiers during the Korean War, there have been troubling reports that Pyongyang will never truly disarm.

Reports earlier this month revealed that the volatile regime is building a nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine, which came on the heels of CIA and other intelligence agencies telling NBC News that North Korea has increased its production of enriched uranium.

North Korea also called the talks with a delegation led by Pompeo in July “regrettable,” claiming the U.S. has undermined the spirit of the summit.

""We had expected that the U.S. side would offer constructive measures that would help build trust based on the spirit of the leaders' summit ... we were also thinking about providing reciprocal measures,"" Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry said in a statement, according to The Associated Press.

""However, the attitude and stance the United States showed in the first high-level meeting (between the countries) was no doubt regrettable,"" the spokesman said.

Pompeo had struck a different tone, telling reporters as he left that the talks with senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol had been “productive.”

North Korea launched its first successful ICBM on July 4, 2017. It conducted two additional tests later in the year, the last one in November, but questions remain about Pyongyang perfecting re-entry technology of its warheads from space and their ability to withstand the intense heat and pressure returning to earth.

"The biggest takeaway message from Tuesday’s primaries and the Ohio special election is that the Republican Party is becoming President Trump’s party.

In fact, the degree to which pro-Trump Republicans prevailed is the fifth major achievement of the Trump presidency so far.

First, the president and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., placed a record number of conservative, constitutionally minded judges on the federal bench.

Second, President Trump moved power out of Washington and liberated businesses to accelerate economic growth through his historic deregulation effort.

Third, the president succeeded in working with congressional Republicans to pass a massive tax cut that has created jobs and grown the economy much faster than any of the elites thought possible.

Fourth, the president began to rebuild the American military after the Obama administration spent eight years deliberately undermining it.

Now President Trump has begun to grow a Trump Republican Party. The examples from Tuesday are striking, but this growth started earlier. In primary after primary, President Trump has proved to be a decisive voice.

I saw this firsthand in Georgia, when his endorsement of Secretary of State Brian Kemp turned what was expected to be a close primary race into a one-sided victory for the Trump candidate. Similarly, on Tuesday the Trump-endorsed candidates won GOP nominations.

This is a very important long-term development because it means that in 2019 and beyond the president will have a Republican Party substantially more favorable to his policies. It also means that the never-Trumpers will gradually decline into a less noisy, less relevant part of American politics.

The never-Trumpers are like the Bourbon monarchy, which “had learned nothing and forgotten nothing” (an apocryphal quote from Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord describing the Bourbons’ behavior after the abdication of Napoleon). Because of their inability to change, the Bourbons gradually disappeared as the French Republics created new patterns.

This shrinking and then disappearing process is nothing new.

When former President Theodore Roosevelt left the Republican Party in 1912, he took a generation of progressives with him. The conservatives consolidated their grip on the Republican Party, and many of the progressives became Franklin Delano Roosevelt Democrats.

Likewise, when President Franklin Roosevelt turned out to be much more liberal than expected, his close friend and ally Al Smith – the former governor of New York and Democratic presidential nominee of 1928 – started supporting Republicans in opposition of the New Deal.

In more recent times, President Ronald Reagan dominated the GOP in the 1980s and dissenters like Sen. Bob Packwood or Oregon, who started off skeptical, came on board. Packwood was convinced to lead the tax reform fight.

Similarly, loyal Democrats like former Sens. Zell Miller of Georgia and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut found the increasing radicalism of the left so unacceptable that they became very pro-Republican. Miller endorsed President George W. Bush at the 2004 Republic National Convention and Lieberman seriously considered running as the vice presidential candidate with Sen. John McCain of Arizona in 2008.

In addition to dominating the primaries, President Trump proved to be very effective in turning out the Republican vote in the Ohio special election. There were a lot of Washington’s so-called experts questioning whether he would help or hurt turnout. While there are still provisional and absentee ballots to count to finalize the result, the results so far indicate that the Republican vote surged in the days leading up to the election and the GOP nominee leads in the current vote count.

The warning to Democrats and the media for the November elections should be pretty direct: If President Trump spends September and October defining the election on his terms, the outcome in November might be as shocking to the left as 2016’s was.

The most amazing thing about the Trump effect is how efficient it is.

Simple tweets have helped nominate the GOP candidates for governor and congressional seats in state after state. With this kind of economy of effort, it is no wonder President Trump is doing so many things in parallel.

In the process, the president is growing a Trump Republican Party that will turn the never-Trumpers into a fossilized remnant of bitter-enders that attract smaller and smaller audiences who pay less and less attention.

In short, this is what a political revolution looks like.",politics
"A tourist from Taiwan taking pictures at a lake in Kenya on Sunday was attacked and killed by a hippo -- just hours before a local fisherman was mauled to death in the same area by another hippo, authorities said.

Both were taken to the hospital in Naivasha, about 56 miles southeast of Nairobi, the Kenya Wildlife Service said in a statement.

Chang was later pronounced dead. His friend was treated for minor bruising.

Authorities said it’s unclear what circumstances led to the attack on the tourists. Wildlife service spokesman Paul Udoto said attacks on tourists are rare because they are usually protected by guides.

Later in the day, a Kenyan fisherman was also mauled by another hippo a few miles from where the initial incident occurred, police said.

""The man was bitten on the chest and his injuries were serious and he died minutes after he was retrieved from the lake,"" said Rift Valley Head of Criminal investigations Gideon Kibunja.

At least six people have been killed by hippos around Lake Naivasha this year, the BBC reported.

Hippos are the world’s deadliest large land animal due to their aggressive nature and sharp teeth. The animals can weigh up to three tons and kill about 500 people in Africa every year, the BBC reported.

"A Democratic mayor from Pennsylvania has resigned nearly a month after he was arrested for allegedly soliciting a woman for sex — a woman who turned out to be a police informant.

Bloomsburg Mayor Eric Bower, 36, initially claimed the accusations were made up because of his “political position.”

He was arrested on April 20 after investigators said he showed up at a Hampton Inn with condoms and $200 in cash. According to the attorney general’s office, the woman, whom Bower solicited for sex that day, was “a Pennsylvania State Police confidential informant.”

Police said Bower met with the informant on several different occasions, with the most recent meetup resulting in his arrest.

“Bower negotiated a fee for sex with the informant and arrived at the location with cash and condoms, where he was taken into custody by police,” the attorney general’s office said in a statement.

ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN, POWERFUL NY DEMOCRAT ACCUSED OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND DRUG ABUSE, RESIGNS AS STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL

Four days after his arrest, Bower told WNEP that the unidentified woman was a friend — he described their relationship as “very playful, you know.”

At the time he planned to fight the charges, claiming that it was a “setup because of my political position.”

However, the Democrat, who was elected in November, announced Thursday through the attorney general’s office that he would be waiving a preliminary hearing and immediately would vacate the mayor’s office.

He also stepped down from his post as a state constable.

Attorney General Josh Shapiro said that Bower “flouted the law.”

“No one is above the law,” Shapiro said in a statement. “I will not allow individuals in power to abuse the trust the public has placed in them. I’m rooting out public corruption wherever we find it, without fear or favor.”

SCHNEIDERMAN RESIGNATION LEAVES REPLACEMENT ATTORNEY GENERAL UP TP NEW YORK LEGILATURE

But Bower’s attorney, Patrick O’Connell, said that the decision to step down was done for the good of Bloomsburg, a small town northwest of Philadelphia.

“The town of Bloomsburg needs to focus on the tasks that it needs to focus on, running an efficient local government, which is challenging enough. But these charges caused a circus environment. Eric Bower recognized that and for the better of the town, decided to resign,” O’Connell said.

Earlier reporting at the time of Bower’s arrest by WOLF cited him as saying that he planned to “hold” his position as mayor and fight the charges against him. Now that he has resigned, it remains unclear if he will continue to dispute the allegations against him.

"A federal judge on Friday harshly rebuked Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team during a hearing for ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort – suggesting they lied about the scope of the investigation, are seeking “unfettered power” and are more interested in bringing down the president.

""You don't really care about Mr. Manafort,” U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III told Mueller’s team. “You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever.""

Further, Ellis demanded to see the unredacted “scope memo,” a document outlining the scope of the special counsel’s Russia probe that congressional Republicans have also sought.

The hearing, where Manafort’s team fought to dismiss an 18-count indictment on tax and bank fraud-related charges, took a confrontational turn as it was revealed that at least some of the information in the investigation derived from an earlier Justice Department probe – in the U.S. attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Manafort’s attorneys argue the special counsel does not have the power to indict him on the charges they have brought – and seemed to find a sympathetic ear with Ellis.

The Reagan-appointed judge asked Mueller’s team where they got the authority to indict Manafort on alleged crimes dating as far back as 2005.

The special counsel argues that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein granted them broad authority in his May 2017 letter appointing Mueller to this investigation. But after the revelation that the team is using information from the earlier DOJ probe, Ellis said that information did not “arise” out of the special counsel probe – and therefore may not be within the scope of that investigation.

“We don’t want anyone with unfettered power,” he said.

Mueller’s team says its authorities are laid out in documents including the August 2017 scope memo – and that some powers are actually secret because they involve ongoing investigations and national security matters that cannot be publicly disclosed.

Ellis seemed amused and not persuaded.

He summed up the argument of the Special Counsel’s Office as, “We said this is what the investigation was about. But we’re not going to be bound by it, and we weren’t really telling the truth in that May 17 letter [appointing a special counsel].”

He referenced the common exclamation from NFL announcers, saying: ""C'mon man!""

Trump himself drew attention to the judge’s comments later Friday afternoon, during an NRA convention in Texas.

“It’s a witch hunt,” he said. “I love fighting these battles.”

The judge also gave the government two weeks to hand over the unredacted “scope memo” or provide an explanation why not -- after prosecutors were reluctant to do so, claiming it has material that doesn’t pertain to Manafort.

“I’ll be the judge of that,” Ellis said.

House Republicans have also sought the full document, though the Justice Department previously released a redacted version, which includes information related to Manafort but not much else.

The charges in federal court in Virginia were on top of another round of charges in October. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to both rounds. The charges filed earlier this year include conspiring against the United States, conspiring to launder money, failing to register as an agent of a foreign principal and providing false statements.

Earlier this year, Ellis suggested that Manafort could face life in prison, and “poses a substantial flight risk” because of his “financial means and international connections to flee and remain at large.”

"They’re in denial.

Lots of them. About lots of things.

A host of administration officials “deny” they wrote the anonymous op-ed in The New York Times which blistered President Trump.

Leading administration officials ranging from White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to Defense Secretary James Mattis denied multiple things they purportedly have said and done in Bob Woodward’s new book.

The White House denies a panoply of things Omarosa Manigault Newman alleges in her book about Mr. Trump.

Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., denies he engaged in insider trading and entered a plea of not guilty.

Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., R-Calif., denies he misused campaign funds.

Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., denies he was physically abusive to a former girlfriend.

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, denies he knew anything about sexual abuse when he served as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State in the 1980s and 1990s.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, denies Democratic assertions he was unreasonable about the production of documents and is rushing to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

Both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., deny there will be a government shutdown come October – despite repeated machinations by President Trump to the contrary.

During an appearance on Fox News with Bret Baier, McConnell declared there was “no chance of a government shutdown.” When Baier queried further, the Kentucky Republican replied “zero.”

“We have a very good agreement with the president,” said Ryan after a bicameral, GOP leadership meeting with Mr. Trump last week about spending bills.

Many find that hard to believe, considering the president is threatening a shutdown over funding for his border wall.

Yours truly asked the speaker if the political oscillation merely reflects how this president rolls.

“Yep!” answered Ryan, drawing gales of laughter from the press corps. “We’re confident that understanding will stick.”

Some Republicans deny that a “blue wave” could be on the way in the midterm elections.

Democrats, supposedly schooled in their political misfortunes of 1994, denied that a red wave lurked in the 2010 midterms.

Some Democrats deny that the economy is humming along, in an effort to gaslight Trump.

Many conservatives deny climate change.

A bunch of Democratic senators express interest in running for president in 2020. There may even be Republican primary challengers to Trump. But so far, everyone denies they’re actually doing so.

Lots of House Democrats deny they’re running for speaker. Or minority leader. Or minority whip. It all hinges on which side wins the House this fall. People are certainly positioning themselves for a bid. But most would deny they were running against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., or Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is eyeing the speakership. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. denies he may outright challenge to McCarthy. But Scalise is certainly positioning himself for something.

Denial is central to politics. They help politicians weather storms and buy time. Certainly denials are relevant because political leaders don’t want the public to digest and process their transgressions. However, many times, politicians deny things because, well, they just aren’t true. Political opponents and hired guns sling mud and cast aspersions, sometimes concocting things from whole cloth.

There’s a reason why Twitter banned Alex Jones a few days ago.

Denial happens a lot in politics. It starts because the public and the pesky press corps have questions. Denial also happens because, well, people are involved. People deny things. Major political leaders find that despite their political prowess, they can’t control bad things happening around them. So, they’re thrust into denial. Or, they’ve built their reputation on not taking guff from anyone. So, they deny bad things, even if they’re true. They develop an intolerance of letting the bad seep in. After all, they’re the ones who supposedly have the answers. To admit defeat or failure is the last thing anyone wants to accept in their political leaders.

Some politicians find themselves in denial because of overconfidence. Most people who wade into politics and public service aren’t shrinking violets. They’re doers. Changers. Persons of action. They’ve squirmed out of a million jams before. So deny it and wiggle free again.

Or, again, maybe the allegations and insinuations or even the criminal charges aren’t true.

Maginault Newman leveled some pretty serious charges against the president. But, she’s not known for her credibility. On the other hand, most administration officials who say they didn’t pen the op-ed boast lots of credibility. Chris Collins and Duncan Hunter Jr. will get a trial. Maybe they did nothing wrong. We’ll find out. It’s hard for Jim Jordan to prove he didn’t know something three decades ago. And Keith Ellison is defending himself against a purported video which no one has seen.

Truth does still win out, after all.

That said, politicians regularly find themselves on the defense against “scurrilous” accusations, some of which are false. These allegations are engineered to project a figure in a bad light. And, even if the assertion isn’t true, most Americans don’t pay close enough attention to know what someone was accused of doing and whether the charge was proven or disproved. Voters just know that the whiff of controversy follows around certain public figures.

That may be unfair. But that’s public life and politics.

And undeniable.

"The State Department is pushing back against a news report saying the Trump administration has ramped up efforts to deny passports to Hispanics who have U.S. citizenship but are suspected of possibly having fraudulent birth certificates.

In a statement to Fox News on Thursday, a State Department spokeswoman blasted the Washington Post over the story, saying passport denials in these cases are actually at a six-year low after peaking in 2015 during the Obama administration.

“The facts don’t back up the Washington Post’s reporting. This is an irresponsible attempt to create division and stoke fear among American citizens while attempting to inflame tensions over immigration,” said Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman. “Under the Trump Administration, domestic passport denials for so called ‘midwife cases’ are at a 6-year low. The reporting is a political cheap shot.”

According the Post, both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations denied passports to people delivered by midwives in Texas’s Rio Grande Valley. The government has long believed fraudulent U.S. birth certificates have been given to babies along the border who were actually born in Mexico.

The newspaper reported the government, though, settled a case with the American Civil Liberties Union in 2009. The Post said that largely stopped the passport denials until the Trump administration took over.

The Washington Post in its story cited several examples of people who said they're being wrongly targeted as the Trump administration challenges people they believe may have fraudulent birth certificates.

The Post cited several examples, including a 40-year-old named Juan who reportedly says he was born in the United States, was delivered by a midwife in southern Texas and served in the Army, the Border Patrol and the state prison system.

“I served my country. I fought for my country,” the man said.

Juan told the newspaper he attempted to renew his U.S. passport this year but the State Department sent him a letter doubting his birth certificate is real.

The Post said Juan is one of “hundreds, and possibly thousands” of Hispanics along the border who have been accused by the Trump administration of having fraudulent birth certificates since they were babies.

But the State Department, in response, provided a chart to Fox News detailing passport denials since 2013 of people on the southern border suspected of possibly having a fraudulent birth document. According to the chart, fewer people had their passports denied in 2017 and 2018 so far, under Trump, than in the final years of the Obama administration.

The State Department had told the Washington Post they sometimes ask people suspected of having fraudulent papers to provide additional proof of birth. Those flagged are applicants who have birth certificates filed by a “midwife or other birth attendant suspected of having engaged in fraudulent activities” or those with both a U.S. and foreign birth certificate.

“Individuals who are unable to demonstrate that they were born in the United States are denied issuance of a passport,” the State Department said.

The newspaper also spotlighted the case of a 35-year-old Texas man who said he was born in the United States but detained after attempting to re-enter the U.S. after a trip to Mexico in 2017.

Agents, the man said, asked him if he was born in Mexico. When he refused to say so, he was sent a detention center and entered into deportation proceedings. He was eventually released but the man said his passport was revoked.

The Washington Post story provoked an avalanche of criticism directed at the Trump administration.

“This administration’s anti-immigrant, nationalistic rhetoric and policies are now targeting U.S. citizens, in an attempt to deny them of the rights that our Constitution guarantees,” the Congressional Hispanic Caucus tweeted. “This is wrong, shameless and betrays our most sacred American ideals.”

Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement the organization is investigating and “exploring possible legal steps.”

“The Trump administration’s attempt to deny passports to long-term American residents living in border areas is just one more inhumane act in a series of unlawful actions,” Gelernt said.",politics
"Apparently Martha’s Vineyard is a safe space.

Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz said last week that his defense of President Donald Trump’s constitutional rights led to him being “shunned” by his own friends at a high-end seasonal destination.

The famed lawyer lamented the efforts to eject him from his social life at Martha’s Vineyard amid his outspoken criticism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the alleged collusion with Russia.

""So they are shunning me and trying to ban me from their social life on Martha’s Vineyard.” - Alan Dershowitz

In an op-ed for The Hill, Dershowitz, a frequent guest on Fox News, said that though he’s politically a liberal Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton in addition to contributing “handsomely” to her campaign, his defense of civil liberties that could benefit Trump is too much to swallow for his social circle.

“But that is not good enough for some of my old friends on Martha’s Vineyard. For them, it is enough that what I have said about the Constitution might help Trump. So they are shunning me and trying to ban me from their social life on Martha’s Vineyard.""

“One of them, an academic at a distinguished university, has told people that he would not attend any dinner or party to which I was invited. He and others have demanded ‘trigger warnings’ so that they can be assured of having 'safe spaces' in which they will not encounter me or my ideas. Others have said they will discontinue contributions to organizations that sponsor my talks,” he added.

Dershowitz went on to compare his situation with McCarthyism in the 1950s, when many innocent people were perceived as being sympathetic to communist ideas and were subjected to job firings and blacklists.

“I never thought I would see McCarthyism come to Martha’s Vineyard, but I have. I wonder if the professor who refuses to listen to anything I have to say also treats his students similarly,” he continued. “Would he listen to a student who actively supported Trump? What about one who simply supported his civil liberties?”

“I never thought I would see McCarthyism come to Martha’s Vineyard, but I have. I wonder if the professor who refuses to listen to anything I have to say also treats his students similarly."" - Alan Dershowitz

Yet, Dershowitz remains defiant amid the efforts to ostracize him from public life. “I will not change my views as a result of these attempts to ostracize me, but there are some who may remain silent for fear of being shunned,” he wrote.

“Silence is not my style. Cowardice is not my philosophy. I intend to speak up when I disagree with Republicans, and I intend to speak up when I disagree with Democrats. Right now I am speaking up in disagreement with Maxine Waters. She — like those who shun me on Martha’s Vineyard — is part of the problem rather than the solution,” he added.",politics
"Public attention was focused Thursday on FBI official Peter Strzok’s televised testimony before two House committees regarding his anti-Trump texts while he was investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. But the decision by a former FBI lawyer who was Strzok’s lover to defy a subpoena to give a closed-door deposition to the same committees Wednesday was getting far less attention than it deserved.

Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page’s action shows that the deliberate destruction of congressional subpoena power is complete and reveals the impotence of Congress to compel evidence. As a result, the ability of Congress to perform substantive oversight is compromised. Only when she was threatened with contempt of Congress proceedings did Page agree to voluntarily appear for a private interview on Friday, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said Thursday.

Page may yet testify at a public hearing before Congress. But why does she or any other government witnesses get to dictate the terms and timing of their own testimony? How many of us who are not federal employees would dare refuse a subpoena from Congress? How many of us would even get away with it?

As I explain in my forthcoming book, “The Deep State,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ inexplicable failure to prosecute subversions of congressional authority played no small role in my decision to resign from Congress and the House Oversight Committee last year. I knew what harm the attorney general’s wrong decision would cost Congress and the public.

Anyone could have seen this coming. The moment Jeff Sessions told me he had no intention of prosecuting Hillary Clinton IT aide Bryan Pagliano regarding her email scandal, I knew the battle was lost.

Anyone could have seen this coming. The moment Jeff Sessions told me he had no intention of prosecuting Hillary Clinton IT aide Bryan Pagliano regarding her email scandal, I knew the battle was lost. Pagliano, you’ll recall, refused to even appear before Congress – not once, but twice. In my role as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, I sent a letter to Sessions in February 2017 recommending prosecution for Pagliano for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the committee.

Up until that point, congressional subpoenas had not been optional except in cases of executive privilege. That’s why Attorney General Eric Holder, who served under President Obama, tried to use an executive privilege claim to protect documents in the investigation of the Fast and Furious scandal.

Fast and Furious was an operation conducted during the Obama administration by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that allowed criminals to buy guns from stores in the Phoenix area. ATF planned to track the guns as they were taken to Mexico to be sold illegally there, but the federal agency lost track of more than 1,400 of the 2,000 guns it allowed the criminal gun smugglers to buy.

Tragically, U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed in a gunfight in 2010 by a member of a criminal gang armed with one of the guns smuggled during the botched Fast and Furious operation

When Holder used the executive privilege excuse to hide the facts about Fast and Furious from the House committee that I chaired, he did so because it was the only way to subvert congressional authority.

But thanks to Attorney General Sessions, it’s now a lot easier to flout a congressional subpoena. Now that Page has gotten away with ignoring a subpoena from Congress, other witnesses will follow suit, confident that the Sessions Justice Department will have their backs.

I have argued that both parties would rue the day we stood by passively while Sessions essentially destroyed our ability to provide meaningful oversight. Democrats may have cheered the move when it shielded Hillary Clinton. But what happens when they want to see documents or hear from a witness? Both sides lost when the attorney general refused to do his job.

How did we get here?

It actually started in 1857, when Congress inadvertently weakened a check and balance in an effort to strengthen it. Congress passed legislation allowing those found in contempt of Congress to be held criminally liable. That was a good move. But then Congress made a big mistake by agreeing to give the Justice Department – rather than Congress itself – the power to enforce the provision.

The system of relying on the Justice Department worked for more than 100 years. The threat of criminal liability was sufficient to obtain compliance for a time. But there was always a weakness in this system – a possibility that the Justice Department could consider its enforcement responsibilities optional, thereby depriving Congress of a critical tool.

In 1982, the Justice Department for the first time decided to exercise its own discretion. The attorney general chose not to prosecute a Reagan Cabinet official who refused to cooperate with Congress. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Ann Gorsuch, mother of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, was able to claim executive privilege. The Justice Department recognized the claim, even though Congress did not.

That would have been the time to correct this structural weakness. But Congress didn’t do it. Instead, the Justice Department essentially created a new carve-out – from that point forward, Congress could not compel disclosure of privileged information.

Pagliano had no such argument. His work on an illegal secret server in Hillary Clinton’s New York residence had no claim to executive privilege. He was required to testify. He could have shown up and pleaded his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. But he didn’t do that. He simply snubbed Congress. Twice.

Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, of course, did nothing. But with the surprise election of President Trump – a non-establishment Republican candidate who ran on draining the swamp – I expected something different. I was disappointed. Sessions had zero interest in draining the swamp. I warned him that this witness had snubbed Congress with impunity.

Now everyone can snub Congress, because Jeff Sessions refused to see the bigger picture. He can’t say he didn’t know. I applied heavy pressure. I told him exactly what was at stake. He made the wrong choice. Now America will pay for it. Getting to the truth just got harder.",politics
"The Democratic National Committee adopted a new rule Friday aimed at preventing non-Democrats, such as independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, from seeking the party’s 2020 presidential nomination, reports said.

The rule change, adopted at a DNC meeting in Providence, R.I., requires all candidates for the party’s nomination to “run and serve” as Democrats, Yahoo News reported.

Some supporters of Sanders -- who caucuses with the Democrats despite declining to declare a party affiliation -- say the move was motivated by “spite” after Sanders gave Hillary Clinton a run for her money during the Democratic primaries in 2016.

But a source told Yahoo News it was actually part of a push to limit the power of so-called superdelegates -- which, ironically, has long been a goal of Sanders.'

Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, ultimately lost the nomination to Clinton when superdelegates from states he won chose not to vote for him at the party's 2016 convention in Philadelphia.

DNC Chairman Tom Perez on Tuesday floated a proposal to eliminate superdelegates on a presidential primary’s first voting ballot, the Washington Post reported. Party leaders would vote only if the contest required a second ballot.

“You had superdelegates voting for Hillary Clinton in states that I won pretty handsomely,” Sanders told Post this week. “And now there is agreement among Tom Perez and our people, and a lot of the Clinton people, to say we should reduce the number of superdelegates.”

Still, the rule change left some Sanders supporters puzzled as to why Democrats would want to make their party less inclusive.

“We just came off a devastating presidential loss in 2016,” Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign, told Yahoo News. “It would seem to me the actual impetus would be to expand the Democratic Party. I, just for the life of me, don’t see any motivation for this beyond personal spite.”

""I just for the life of me don’t see any motivation for this beyond personal spite.” - Mark Longabaugh, senior adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign

A photo of a printout of the rule change was shared Friday in a Twitter message posted by DNC member Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.

“At the time a presidential candidate announces their candidacy publicly, they must publicly affirm that they are a Democrat,” the printout says. ""Each candidate must then affirm in writing that they: A. are a member of the Democratic Party; B. will accept the Democratic nomination; C. will run and serve as a member of the Democratic Party.”

But Sanders may be protected from the change thanks to a resolution passed in his home state, by which he is considered a Democrat, “for all purposes and [is] entitled to all the rights and privileges that come with such membership at the state and federal level,” Politico reported.

DNC members will meet in August for a final vote on the proposal to eliminate superdelegates, Yahoo News reported.",politics

Nearly one hundred Venezuelan migrants in Peru are making an unexpected journey home after deciding to take up their government's offer of a free flight back instead of continuing to eke out a living in a foreign land.

With packed suitcases in hand, the migrants prepared Monday to board an all-expenses paid flight to capital city Caracas with Venezuelan state-run airline Conviasa, a trip that most would be unable to afford on their own.

""My experience wasn't pleasant,"" said Aury Durand, 24, who is eight months pregnant and said she was returning with a mix of ""happiness and rage,"" after working long hours at a car wash and only getting one-third of the wages she was due.

""I'll be happy to see my country, whatever state it's in,"" she said.

In interviews with The Associated Press, several of those returning said they had difficulty finding jobs and encountered hurtful xenophobia that made a recent offer by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to fly them back appealing — a sharp contrast to the plight of hundreds of thousands of compatriots now trying to leave.

An estimated 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled their nation's crippling economic and humanitarian crisis since 2014, according to the United Nations. In countries like Colombia and Peru, several thousand migrants now enter the country planning to stay each day. The dramatic influx has sparked tensions and fueled xenophobia.

Still, the vast majority of those arriving say they'd prefer to start over than suffer through Venezuela's food and medical shortages, making the group departing Peru an outlier, though still a telling example of the trials many face.

""Peru opened its doors, but it also didn't have a plan,"" said Robinson Martinez, a returning 32-year-old mechanical engineer.

Martinez said that in his first three months in Peru he made a living selling candy on the street and even managed to send as much as $15 back to Venezuela in remittances a week. But as the number of Venezuelans arriving in Peru continued to boom, the work became harder. He made fewer sales and said his rent doubled.

Then Martinez and his wife read online about a new initiative launched by Maduro called ""Return to the Homeland,"" encouraging young Venezuelans who have left to come back and work in Venezuela — chopping up the flight of the nation's brightest as another right-wing scheme to loosen his grip on power.

""Venezuelans won't be slaves to anyone in the world!"" Maduro proclaimed.

The offer might have felt like a farce to the droves who can barely afford food amid soaring hyperinflation expected to reach 1 million percent this year, but Martinez was intrigued, willing to put his trust in the president's offer.

Over dinner one evening with his wife, who found work at a radio station in Peru, Martinez said she suggested that, ""The best thing is for you to go to Venezuela and I'll help from here.""

On Monday morning, Martinez and his 8-year-old daughter were among those heading to the airport.

""He's giving us the opportunity to return without paying anything,"" Martinez said of Maduro. ""He said that on arriving in Venezuela, he'll give us a hand with a productive job. I trust it.""

More than 400,000 Venezuelans are now living in Peru, with the vast majority arriving this year. Peru recently enacted stiffer entry requirements, asking all Venezuelans who reach the border to show a passport. Migration officials from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil are meeting in Bogota this week to decide on a regional response.",world
"Missouri recently took the step of outlawing marriage between 15-year-olds.

On Friday, Gov. Mike Parson signed Senate Bill 655 into law. Prior to that, Missouri was one of 25 states with no minimum marriage age.

“The welfare of our children must always be a top priority,” said Parson, reports the Kansas City Star.

The legislative move comes after the newspaper published a series in March on child marriage that showed Missouri had the dubious distinction of the most permissive laws in the nation.

As a result, the publication reports, Missouri was something of a destination for underage brides, with 1,000 15-year-old girls marrying between 1999 and 2017.

CALIFORNIA DEMS SNUB SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN FOR LONGSHOT RIVAL

Now, the minimum legal age for marriage in the state is 16; tying the knot at 16 or 17 requires the signed approval of at least one parent. Additionally, marriage licenses will not be given to people age 21 and older intending to marry someone 16 or younger.

“It’s done. It’s awesome,” Rep. Jean Evans, a Republican from St. Louis County who worked to change the state’s child marriage laws, told the Star. “I think some people think there’s not much to it because we raised it from 15 to 16. (But) there was no minimum before.

“Most important, we are not going to allow adults to prey on children. Someone 21 is not going to be allowed to marry someone 15. We are not going to allow adults to legalize what is statutory rape,” Evans added.

The new law places Missouri among an ever-increasing number of states adopting stricter child marriage laws.

In May, Delaware became the first state in the nation to ban child marriage—anyone under 18—altogether, with no exceptions. New Jersey followed suit in June. In the last two years, Virginia and Texas outlawed marriages under age 18, unless the children have been legally emancipated. New York last year made 17 the minimum age.",politics
"A federal jury in Virginia convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on eight counts of bank and tax fraud, making him the first campaign associate of President Trump found guilty by a jury as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.

But after four days of deliberations, the jury told Judge T.S. Ellis III on Tuesday afternoon that it could not come to a decision on ten other counts related to financial crimes. A mistrial was declared on those counts.

“I feel very badly for Paul Manafort,” Trump told reporters Tuesday evening after landing in West Virginia for a political rally.

“It has nothing to do with Russian collusion,” Trump added, calling Mueller’s probe a “witch hunt.”

The jury began deliberating last Thursday after a three week trial where prosecutors said Manafort hid income earned from political work overseas from the IRS while fraudulently obtaining millions in bank loans. Manafort, 69, had pleaded not guilty to all 18 counts.

Manafort was stone-faced as the verdict was read. The government has until Aug. 29 to decide whether it will move to retry the 10 deadlocked counts.

Manafort is facing a maximum sentence of 80 years in prison.

Outside court, Manafort attorney Kevin Downing thanked the jurors for “their very long and hard-fought deliberation"" and said he believed his client got a fair trial.

“He is evaluating all of his options at this point,” Downing said of Manafort.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE PAUL MANAFORT CASE

Before the jury was dismissed, Ellis asked jurors if they wanted their names to remain confidential. All answered yes. The judge told them they were allowed to speak to the press if they chose.

In court, Ellis -- known for his colorful comments and reprimands of lawyers throughout the trial -- commended both sides of lawyers for their ""effective and zealous representation.”

Earlier Tuesday, the 12-member jury signaled difficulty reaching consensus when it sent Ellis a note.

""If we cannot come to consensus on a single count...what does that mean for the final verdict?"" they asked.

Ellis responded that this would not be “exceptional” and said the jury could reach a “partial verdict.”

Downing asked Ellis if he would tell the jury they have a third option – “hung jury” -- on each of these counts. The prosecution objected to that plan and Ellis agreed.

The whirlwind trial is the first to result from Mueller's ongoing investigation into Russian election meddling, although Manafort's prosecution does not relate to any election interference or alleged collusion by the Trump team with Russian officials.

While Trump lamented the guilty verdict, Democrats on Capitol Hill pounced.

“The conviction of Paul Manafort on multiple felony charges of bank and tax fraud marks a major turning point in the Special Counsel’s ongoing investigation, and shows again that the president’s campaign was populated by individuals with a history of unscrupulous and dishonest business dealings and concerning ties to overseas interests,” said California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

“He is evaluating all of his options at this point."" - Defense attorney Kevin Downing, on Manafort

As the jury entered its fourth day of deliberations, the defense expressed optimism that things were headed in their direction.

Manafort entered the courtroom earlier Tuesday morning looking upbeat. Manafort patted a couple of his lawyers on the shoulder and acknowledged his wife Kathleen, sitting in the front row, with a wink.

Defense attorneys rested their case without calling Manafort or any other witnesses to the stand. But attorneys for Manafort suggested that Mueller’s team had improperly ensnared their client in its probe, as the case did not have anything to do with Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

In closing arguments last week, the prosecution painted the former Trump campaign chairman as a chronic liar, telling jurors Manafort was “not above the law.”

The prosecution’s star witness, Rick Gates – Manafort’s former business partner who struck a plea deal to cooperate with the government -- testified during the trial that he and Manafort committed bank and tax fraud together.

Manafort’s legal troubles continue, whether or not prosecutors attempt to retry the deadlocked counts. He also faces charges in a separate federal court case in Washington, including conspiring against the United States, conspiring to launder money, failing to register as an agent of a foreign principal and providing false statements.

"The third hurricane of the season formed far out over the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, but doesn't pose any immediate threat to land.

The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Florence has maximum sustained winds near 75 mph and is located about 1,230 miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. As of 11 a.m. ET, the storm was moving west-northwest at 12 mph.

""Florence is moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph, and this motion is expected to continue through Wednesday,"" the NHC said. ""A slower northwestward motion is forecast to begin Thursday and continue through the weekend.""

A forecast track by the NHC shows the storm eventually heading into the central Atlantic by Sunday. It's too early to know if the storm will affect any land, but residents and tourists on Bermuda are asked to remain vigilant into next week.

2018 ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON NOW TO BE 'LESS ACTIVE' APPROACHING PEAK MONTHS, NOAA SAYS

Florence comes as residents along the Gulf Coast are preparing for Tropical Storm Gordon to make landfall late Tuesday as a minimal hurricane.

Hurricane Florence is the basin’s sixth named storm of the year. Last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the Atlantic hurricane season is now expected to be ""less active"" as it enters its peak months due a combination of conditions in the ocean and atmosphere helping to limit storm development.

NOAA forecasters are now calling for 9 to 13 named storms with winds of 39 mph or higher, of which 4 to 7 will strengthen into hurricanes. Of those storms, there may be up to 2 major hurricanes, which are classified as Category 3, 4 and 5 with winds of 111 mph or higher.",world
"President Trump fired back Tuesday amid the Philadelphia furor over his decision to disinvite the Eagles from a White House event, touting a patriotic ceremony being held instead and declaring: “No escaping to Locker Rooms!”

Trump triggered a backlash from the City of Brotherly Love after he rescinded his invitation for the Super Bowl champions amid the controversy over national anthem protests.

The White House is instead hosting a ""Celebration of America"" event on Tuesday.

“We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M., The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!” Trump tweeted early Tuesday.

The White House decision to disinvite the whole team marked the end of speculation over whether the Eagles would visit the White House in some capacity. The team reportedly wanted to send a small group of players.

“The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!” Trump tweeted late Monday.

TRUMP SWAYED NFL OWNERS ON ANTHEM RULES, KAEPERNICK CASE DEPOSITIONS REVEAL

But Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney blasted Trump as “not a true patriot” and a “fragile egomaniac” over the move.

“Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our president is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend,” Kenney said in a statement.

Last month, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the league would fine teams and league personnel who do not “stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem.” Goodell said the league unanimously agreed to the vote, though San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York abstained.

The new overhaul does allow players to remain in the locker room for the anthem.

Trump has praised the new policy, but his Eagles decision -- and swipe Tuesday at those who stay in the locker room -- reflects ongoing tension between his White House and players protesting police violence by sitting out the national anthem.

Trump also used his Twitter account Tuesday to note past events the White House has held with other championship teams.

“We have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others. National Anthem & more great music today at 3:00 P.M.,” Trump tweeted, adding minutes later that “@NASCAR and Champion @MartinTruex_Jr were recently at the White House. It was a great day for a great sport!”

"Former Vice President Joe Biden was encouraged to “not walk away” from politics last week in a 90-minute visit with Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has been recovering from recent brain cancer treatment and surgery, according to reports.

Biden visited the senator’s Sedona ranch last Sunday and the pair discussed pressing matters including the “state of the country” and America’s “international reputation,” a report in The New York Times stated.

Biden, a Democrat who hasn’t ruled out a run for president in 2020, visited with McCain last weekend, The New York Times and The Associated Press reported.

News of those words of encouragement came in a report that also alluded to ongoing tensions between McCain and President Trump. According to The Times, McCain's intimates have advised the White House that when the time comes, they intend to invite Vice President Mike Pence -- but not Trump -- to the senator's funeral.

Tension between the two men flared during the presidential campaign when Trump, discussing war heroes, said he preferred those who hadn't been captured. A Navy pilot during the Vietnam War, McCain was a prisoner of war for over five years.

In his book “The Restless Wave,” set to be released on May 22, McCain also criticizes the president for his stance on the refugee crisis and his relationship to the Russian government, USA Today reported.

The Times report on McCain could not be independently verified by the time of this article's publication.

The 81-year-old McCain has been unable to return to the Senate after cancer treatment and surgery for an intestinal infection last month. He has had numerous visitors aside from Biden, including Sen. Lindsey Graham and former Sen. Joseph Lieberman.

McCain was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer almost a year ago.

In what would have been unthinkable in India before the Asian Games, there'll be no kabaddi gold medals for the spiritual home of the sport.

A day after Iran stunned the seven-time champion Indian men in the semifinals, the Iranians won the women's title with a 27-24 thriller over India on Friday.

Too bad for India, which has long dominated a sport that blends tag and tackle with wrestling moves.

The Indian women took an early 7-3 lead but Iran rallied to take a 17-13 margin and eventually held on in a tense finish for victory.

The Iranian men were playing for gold against South Korea later Friday. The Koreans in the group stage became the first team ever to beat India's men's team at the Asian Games. This is the first time since the sport was introduced in 1990 that India won't win a gold.

India's woes continued when former No. 1-ranked Kidambi Srikanth was upset 23-21, 21-19 in the second round of men's singles in the badminton by Vincent Wong of Hong Kong.

The sixth day of competition was expected to be headlined by Japanese teenager Rikako Ikee and her bid for a sixth gold medal, and a record-equaling eighth medal at a single Asian Games.

Ikee led qualifiers in the heats of the women's 50-meter freestyle.

China's three-time Olympic champion Sun Yang was aiming for his fourth freestyle gold medal of the games, hoping to add the 1,500 title to his victories in the 200, 400 and 800.

Until Friday, no cyclist had won both the road race and the individual time trial at the same Asian Games. Now two cyclists have done it.

Two days after her road race victory, South Korea's Na Ah-reum won the women's time trial at Subang in West Java from Eri Yonamine of Japan and Leung Wing Yee of Hong Kong.

Kazakstan's Alexey Lutsenko made it back-to-back golds on back-to-back days by winning the men's time trial from Muradjan Khalmuratov of Uzbekistan and Japan's Fumiyuki Beppu, whom he edged in a sprint finish to the road race 24 hours earlier.

Japan won its fifth consecutive Asian Games softball gold medal with a 7-0 shutout against Taiwan.

The first Asian Games gold medal ever awarded the Asian Games, and Cambodia's first medal for the 2018 games, went to Jessa Khan, who beat Mahra Alhinaai of the United Arab Emirates in the women's 49-kilogram class.

Kim Hyo Sim won North Korea's fifth gold medal in weightlifting with victory in the women's 63-kilogram division.

Kim collected gold with a total of 250 kilograms, well clear of fellow North Korean Choe Hyo Sim, who was a silver medalist at the 2016 Olympics and the 2015 world championships.

With China barred from the weightlifting competition for doping violations, the North Koreans are atop the standings in the sport.

The first doping case of the Jakarta-Palembang games was registered against a wrestler from Turkmenistan. The Olympic Council of Asia said Rustem Nazarov, who lost in the quarterfinals of the 57-kilogram division, was disqualified from the games after testing positive for the banned diuretic furosemide in a test on the eve of the opening ceremony.

There were six doping cases at the last Asian Games held at Incheon, South Korea, in 2014.

"The Trump administration has decided to cut more than $200 million in bilateral aid to the Palestinians, following a review of the funding for projects in the West Bank and Gaza, the State Department said Friday.

The department notified Congress of the decision in a brief, three-paragraph notice sent first to lawmakers and then to reporters. It said the administration will redirect the money to ""high priority projects elsewhere.""

The move comes as President Donald Trump and his Middle East pointmen, Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, staff up their office to prepare for the rollout of a much-vaunted but as yet unclear peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians.

""At the direction of President Trump, we have undertaken a review of U.S. assistance to the Palestinian Authority and in the West Bank and Gaza to ensure these funds are spent in accordance with U.S. national interests and provide value to the U.S. taxpayer,"" the department said. ""As a result of that review, at the direction of the president, we will redirect more than $200 million ... originally planned for programs in the West Bank and Gaza.""

""This decision takes into account the challenges the international community faces in providing assistance in Gaza, where Hamas control endangers the lives of Gaza's citizens and degrades an already dire humanitarian and economic situation,"" the notice said, without providing additional details.

One main issue the U.S. has had with support for the Palestinian Authority had been its stipends paid to the families of Palestinians killed, injured or jailed for attacks on Israel. Israel and the Trump administration, have repeatedly demanded that those payments from a so-called ""martyrs' fund"" be halted because they encourage terrorism. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has refused to do so.

The Palestine Liberation Organization quickly denounced the decision, calling it ""the use of cheap blackmail as a political tool. The Palestinian people and leadership will not be intimidated and will not succumb to coercion.""

""The rights of the Palestinian people are not for sale,"" PLO Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi said in a statement. ""There is no glory in constantly bullying and punishing a people under occupation. The U.S. administration has already demonstrated meanness of spirit in its collusion with the Israeli occupation and its theft of land and resources; now it is exercising economic meanness by punishing the Palestinian victims of this occupation.""

The notice did not give an exact amount of the funds to be cut, but said they had been approved in 2017 as part of a $230.1 million package in economic support funds for the Palestinians.

One official said the specific amount had not yet been determined because $25 million in planned 2017 funding for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network, which provides health care to Palestinians, remains on hold and under review. All or part of that could still be released or reprogrammed, the official said.

The U.S. had planned to give the Palestinians $251 million for good governance, health, education and funding for civil society in the current 2018 budget year that ends on Sept.30. But with just over a month to go before that money must be used, reprogrammed to other areas or returned to Treasury, less than half has actually been spent.

Earlier this month, the department had released about $60 million of the 2018 money for security projects that encourage cooperation between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. Israel and Jordan, in particular, had lobbied for the security assistance to be continued.

The loss of the assistance is almost certain to further provoke the Palestinians against the Trump peace plan. The Palestinian leadership has been openly hostile to any proposal from the administration, citing what it says is a pro-Israel bias, notably after Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December and moved the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv in May. The Palestinian Authority and Abbas broke off contact with the U.S. after the Jerusalem announcement.

The announcement does not include some $65 million in frozen U.S. funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which provides services to Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon. However, the Trump administration is extremely skeptical of UNRWA and that money is also likely to be reprogrammed, according to officials.

Friday's decision follows a similar decision last week in which the State Department announced that it was redirecting $230 million dollars in aid that had been planned for stabilization programs in liberated areas of Syria. In that case, however, the department said the loss of U.S. funding would be more than offset by other nations, including Saudi Arabia, which announced a $150 million contribution for Syria stabilization just hours before the American announcement.",politics
"A major shipping route located between Oman and Iran where nearly one-third of the world's sea-traded oil passes through daily may become a new flashpoint after a top Iranian Navy general said Monday that the country has taken full control of the Strait of Hormuz.

The head of the navy of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Gen. Alireza Tangsiri, said that Iran had full control of both the Persian Gulf itself and the Strait of Hormuz that leads into it, Reuters reported.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded Monday night: ""The Islamic Republic of Iran does not control the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait is an international waterway. The United States will continue to work with our partners to ensure freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in international waterways.""

The strait, which at its narrowest point is 21 miles wide, has shipping lanes that are 2 miles wide in each direction and is the only sea passage from many of the world's largest oil producers to the Indian Ocean.

""It's a very contentious area,"" retired Lt. Col. Bob Maginnis told Fox News' ""Your World with Neil Cavuto"" earlier this month.

The Strait of Hormuz is where most of the oil from Saudi Arabia passes through, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Saudis have constructed pipelines to bypass the strait, but a majority of crude oil is shipped by sea, meaning that any action by Iran to halt shipping may impact consumers across the world.

""The blockage of the Strait of Hormuz, even temporarily, could lead to substantial increases in total energy costs,"" the agency said in a 2012 report.

At the beginning of August, Iran began a large-scale exercise in the Strait of Hormuz involving more than 50 small boats, practicing “swarming” operations that could potentially shut down the vital waterway if ever deployed for real. The drill came after President Trump pulled the U.S. out of a landmark nuclear accord with Iran and leaders of both countries exchanged fiery rhetoric.

The country routinely operates small boats in the Strait of Hormuz and the surrounding area, and has often threatened to shut down the highly traveled waterway. A check of conditions on MaritimeTraffic.com on Monday showed that conditions appeared to be normal, with heavy maritime traffic through the strait.

In recent weeks Iranian President Hassan Rouhani renewed the threat, saying that if sanctions threatened Iran's crude oil exports, the rest of the Middle East's exports would be threatened as well.

""They're causing problems once again, as predicted, in the Strait of Hormuz,"" Maginnis said. ""This is something we've grown accustomed too.""

IRAN SAYS IT HAS CONTROL OF GULF AND STRAIT OF HORMUZ: REPORT

But if Iran were to follow through with any bluster to close down the vital shipping channel, a potential U.S. response would be swift.

""The U.S. and our partners provide and promote security and stability in the region on a daily basis,"" Lt. Chloe Morgan, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command spokesperson, said in a statement to Fox News on Monday. ""Together, we stand ready to ensure the freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce wherever international law allows.""

Gen. Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, said earlier this month that Iran was showcasing its military capabilities and has the ability to plant mines and explosive boats in the waterway, as well as use missiles and radar along the coast. He stressed the U.S. and allies routinely train for that possibility and are prepared to insure that freedom of navigation and commerce continues in those waters.

""We are aware of what's going on and we remain ready to protect ourselves,"" he told reporters.

Fox News security analyst Walid Phares told Fox Business Network's ""Varney & Co."" that the Iranians can damage the international passage ""if they want,"" but that the U.S. can easily ""intercept them, stop them, and damage their own capacity.""

""It's kind of a brinkmanship capacity of gaming with us,"" Phares said. ""I think the United States is very much attentive to what they are doing, and will respond if the Iranians will cross that red line.""

IRAN DEPLOYS 50 SMALL BOATS TO STRAIT OF HORMUZ FOR LARGE-SCALE 'SWARMING' EXERCISE

President Obama's former National Security Adviser Jim Jones, a four-star general, said in an interview earlier this month the Iranian Navy should be ""wiped out"" if any action is taken to block maritime traffic.

“I personally would like to see, if they ever did something in the Strait of Hormuz, I would like to see their navy disappear,"" Jones told The National.

Jones, who served as national security adviser for Obama from 2009 to 2010, also told the National that Iran's government is an ""an existential threat to the region.""

Iran has been active in Syria, backing the government of President Bashar Assad, while also stoking violence in the southern part of the country and triggering military counterattacks from Israel. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia have condemned Iran repeatedly for providing missiles to Yemeni Houthi rebels, who have fired toward Riyadh.

The Iranian officials recently threatened to block the waterway in retaliation for any hostile action by the U.S. government amid President Trump’s remarks in July, which were prompted by the Iranian President Rouhani saying the U.S. risks the “mother of all wars"" with Iran.

Trump called for Rouhani to stop the rhetoric or – in caps lock – “suffer the consequences the like of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence and death. Be cautious!”

Just over two weeks ago, Iran test-fired a ballistic missile as a brazen display of defiance, which coincided with the naval exercise, three U.S. officials with knowledge of the launch told Fox News at the time.

While the U.S. military publicly acknowledged the naval activity, the missile test from an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps base in Bandar-e-Jask in southeastern Iran has not been previously reported. The launch was detected by U.S. spy satellites.

"The Trump administration announced Tuesday it planned to end what it suggested was an illegal Obama-era rule allowing unions to collect dues from state subsidies intended for home health workers -- including family caregivers.

Federal law generally prohibits states from skimming money from Medicaid payments bound for independent in-home personal care workers. But in 2014, the Obama administration created an exception, saying that states could divert some of that Medicaid money to unions, on the theory that these workers effectively were public-sector employees.

Eleven left-leaning states have used that provision to raise more than $200 million a year for unions by taking it from health workers who often didn't even realize it, according to top GOP officials.

Those states include California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Illinois -- a blue state which has been at the center of recent Supreme Court rulings stripping power from organized labor.

SUPREME COURT DEALS MAJOR BLOW TO LABOR UNIONS

But GOP leaders said the Obama administrative exception violates the federal Social Security Act, as well as the rights of home health workers.

The Trump administration's decision means that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has begun the formal process of proposing a new rule to roll back the Obama regulation.

“The law provides that Medicaid providers must be paid directly and cannot have part of their payments diverted to third parties outside of a few very specific exceptions,” Tim Hill, acting director of the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, said in a statement. “This proposed rule is intended to ensure that providers receive their complete payment, and any circumstances in which a state does divert part of a provider’s payment must be clearly allowed under the law.”

""Union dues skimming diverts Medicaid funds from the very people that the program is supposed to help."" - GOP Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson

House Republicans have long sought to pull the plug on the Obama-era rule, which they have characterized as unethical and illegal. Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, who chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, had urged the Trump administration to take action on the issue earlier this year.

In a statement, Johnson told Fox News he would continue to monitor Medicaid funding.

“Union dues skimming diverts Medicaid funds from the very people that the program is supposed to help,"" Johnson said. ""I applaud the Trump Administration for taking the first steps to rein in this abuse. My committee will continue to conduct oversight of CMS’s stewardship of Medicaid funds so that American taxpayers can have confidence the funds flow to those in need.”

The so-called dues skimming has continued to occur despite a 2014 Supreme Court ruling that home health workers couldn't constitutionally be required to pay union agency fees because they were not public-sector workers.

The Trump administration's move marked the latest setback for unions. Last month, the Supreme Court dealt yet another tough blow to organized labor in Janus v. AFSCME, which held that nonunion public workers could not be forced to pay agency fees to public-sector unions, either.

It had long been illegal for unions to force non-members to pay for their explicitly political activity, but the Supreme Court's ruling extended that prohibition to the payment of the agency fees, saying even those expenditures amounted to unconstitutionally coerced participation in the political activity of collective bargaining.

In a statement, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) called the Trump administration's move a ""broad, coordinated attack against working people,"" and said it would hurt minorities.

""The proposed CMS rule, combined with the Janus ruling, are two more efforts by the Trump Administration and billionaire-funded special interest groups to silence a workforce comprised of 90 percent women, most of whom are women of color, and to reduce the power of working people by making it more difficult for them to join together in a union to fight to ensure that our loved ones can get the care they need to live at home with dignity,"" read a statement by Melody Benjamin, who SEIU said is a home care worker.",politics
"Vice President Mike Pence spoke at a ceremony Wednesday to mark the arrival of the remains of U.S. servicemen from the Korean War -- and joining him were two guests who lost their fathers in the war.

Pence took to Twitter Wednesday to share that he and his wife Karen would attend the ceremony in Honolulu with Diana Brown Sanfilippo and Rick Downes.

The vice president said that when Sanfilippo was 4 years old she lost her father in the Korean War during a recon mission, and that when Downes was just 3 years old he lost his father operating radar on a B-26 bomber.

Pence later wrote he was “humbled & honored” to be a part of the repatriations ceremony.

North Korea handed over the remains of what U.S. officials said are believed to be the remains of U.S servicemen who fought during the Korean War. A U.S. military plane made a rare trip into North Korea to retrieve 55 cases.

Fox News’ Pete Hegseth, who was traveling with Pence in Air Force Two, recalled the touching stories of the heroes' now-grown children.

“We picked up probably the two most important passengers on that plane: a man and woman who were 4 and 3 years old — little girl and little boy in the 1950s — when they sent their fathers, then young men, both pilots, both first lieutenants, both went to fight in the Korean War,” he said on “Fox & Friends.”

“They dedicated their lives for the last 60 years finding out what happened to their fathers, what happened though those patriots, warriors who went to fight for us, for every generation of Americans,” Hegseth continued.

The returned remains are seen as one major accomplishment of Trump’s historic summit in Singapore with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un last month.",politics
"An Australian woman who injured two people during a convenience store ax attack has been convicted of attempted murder after jurors reportedly rejected her argument that she was suffering from a mental episode caused by medications she was taking to transition from male to female.

Evie Amati, 26, was found guilty Friday for the unprovoked 2017 attack in Sydney and will face sentencing in September, according to the BBC.

""I really hope that [Amati] is able to have some sort of rehabilitation because ultimately that's what justice is about,” Sharon Hacker, a victim who suffered a fractured skull in the attack, told reporters following the verdict.

On January 7 last year, Amati was captured on surveillance video walking into a 7-Eleven store carrying an ax around 2 a.m. local time.

She walked up to a man waiting in line at the cash register, later identified as Ben Rimmer, and talked to him briefly before swinging the ax at him, the BBC reported. Rimmer fell to the ground with a facial wound and fractures, while Hacker was then attacked near the door.

Amati also targeted a third man outside the store, but he managed to protect himself by using his backpack as a makeshift shield.

The BCC reported that Amati was arrested outside the store. During her trial, the victims said they thought she had come from a costume party when she walked into the store with the weapon.

Amati pleaded not guilty and told jurors that she was in a bad mental state because she was taking hormones to help her transition from male to female, the station added.

Her lawyer, Charles Waterstreet, was quoted saying Amati was “out of her mind” and was also affected by drug and alcohol use.

But the jury ultimately sided against Amati, convicting her of two counts of wounding with intent to murder and another count of attempted wounding with intent to murder.",world

Russia's foreign minister says negotiations are underway to establish a humanitarian corridor for civilians to be able to leave Idlib, the northern rebel-held province of Syria where concerns of an imminent large conflict are mounting.

Syria on Thursday proposed establishing the corridor, which would channel civilians to government-held areas. That would send many back into parts of Syria they once fled in its 7-1/2-year-old civil war.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters Friday that it is necessary to minimize risks for civilians in Idlib. Russia has repeatedly claimed that rebels are preparing a chemical weapons attack in Idlib that the West could blame on President Bashar Assad's forces and use as a pretext for retaliatory strikes.

2:20 p.m.

Syrian opposition fighters blew up bridges Friday linking areas they control to government-held territories in northwestern Syria in anticipation of a military offensive against their last stronghold in the country, activists and a war monitor said.

The explosions rocked the area in al-Ghab plains, south of idlib and came after rebels detected government troop movement in the area, according to Rami Abdurrahman, head of the war monitoring Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Abdurrahman said two other bridges remain in the area and could be used by government forces to move in on the rebel stronghold.

Most of Idlib province and adjacent strips of Hama province remain in the hands of an assortment of armed groups, some Turkey-backed and others independent Islamist groups. But the strongest alliance of fighters is led by an al-Qaida-linked group that controls most of the area that is also home to some 3 million people.

Thousands of government troops and allied fighters have been amassing in areas surrounding Idlib while Russia, Syria's powerful ally, has said a military operation was necessary to weed out ""terrorists"" it blames for attacking its bases on the coast.",world

The sight of five burly guards blocking her way out of her dorm filled Ren Liping with rage.

It was 3 a.m. on a recent Saturday (Aug. 4) and the thin, bespectacled 26-year-old Chinese graduate student was exhausted. Her mind raced back to earlier in the day when she had tried once again to publicly protest her alleged rape. Again, the police had stopped her and held her at a station for hours. Again, she was escorted back to campus.

Now this.

She pounded on the glass door with her fist, but the men ignored her. ""This is illegal!"" she shouted, to no response. She felt nauseous. Her face was numb. She picked up a bicycle pump in the corner and smashed it against the glass.

The door shattered.

""Whoever tries to suppress my case will end up like this door,"" Ren said to the men.

More than a year after she accused an ex-boyfriend of raping her on the China University of Petroleum campus in the coastal city of Qingdao, this had become Ren's life: a series of attempts to protest the university and authorities' mishandling of the case.

At every turn, Ren has been stymied by the school's guards or the police, who say there's no evidence of a crime. She was even detained in a hotel for six days at one point.

Her efforts highlight at once the challenges of reporting sexual assault in China and the determination of a new generation of Chinese women pushing the country into its own #MeToo moment despite attempts to silence them.

The movement has gathered considerable steam in China, with dozens of men, including prominent media personalities, non-profit advocates and even a top monk, publicly accused of sexual assault or sexual misconduct in recent months.

But like any social campaign, #MeToo poses a challenge to President Xi Jinping's administration, which has waged an unprecedented crackdown on civil society groups and activism that the ruling Communist Party deems as threats to its rule.

Ren accuses Liang Shengyu, her ex-boyfriend, of raping her on campus last summer. Liang denies the allegation. They are suing each other for defamation.

In what legal experts say is unprecedented, Ren is also suing the police — for what she's described as a mishandling of the investigation and the use of force against her.

""She is a representative for the #MeToo movement,"" said Lyu Xiaoquan, a Beijing lawyer who helped Ren prepare her initial complaints.

Ren and Liang met in 2013 when they were undergraduates at the university's geosciences department. Liang says he was attracted to Ren's strength and independence. They dated for two years, experiencing for the first time the freedom of a romance far from their parents' scrutiny.

After a bitter breakup, Liang and Ren rarely spoke. But last summer they got back in touch, and on the evening of July 28, 2017, agreed to walk back to their dorms together after Liang completed an assignment in the lab.

Their accounts of the rest of the night diverge.

Ren said Liang asked her if they could get back together, but that she said no because she liked someone else. Liang then cornered her in a bicycle parking lot, she said, pinned her against a concrete wall and put his hand inside her denim shorts.

Stunned and terrified, Ren tried to choke him but wasn't strong enough.

""You're dirty,"" she told him.

""You've been with me before,"" he said, according to Ren. ""You didn't think I was dirty then,"" she alleges he said.

Ren said Liang ignored her protests, pulled down her shorts and raped her. She was sobbing in pain, she said.

""Do you want to destroy me?"" she cried at the time.

That's when he stopped, picked his cap up off the ground, and walked away, Ren said.

According to Liang, however, Ren had been pestering him for weeks because she thought he had a new girlfriend.

Liang said Ren tried to convince him to break up with this woman and that all they did that night was argue.

""We did not have any physical contact whatsoever that night,"" he said. ""And there was no so-called rape or sexual assault or behavior of that kind.""

At first, Ren did not plan on reporting her alleged rape.

""I didn't know what people would think of me,"" she said.

When it continued to haunt her five days later, she told the school, but administrators encouraged her to keep quiet. Then she went to the local police station, where a female officer told her to drop her claim, saying that not all sexual experiences are pleasurable, according to Ren.

Frustrated, Ren filed lawsuits against the police and started holding protests.

But the authorities' resolve to silence her only grew with her efforts. In June, after she shouted in the middle of a campus square about being raped, Ren said security detained her inside a hotel room in Qingdao for six days while the city hosted a major summit.

Her parents were also ordered to stay in the hotel with her. Her mother, a wheat farmer from rural Henan, said university officials dangled vague job offers and study abroad opportunities to get Ren to drop her case. Their promises to investigate Liang's conduct never materialized, according to her mother, who requested that she only be identified by her surname, Zhang.

""Everyone lied to us,"" Zhang said. ""It's because our family has no money or power — if we did, things wouldn't have reached this stage.""

School officials declined repeated requests to comment. Police in a district in Qingdao that oversees the campus said investigators examined the case closely, interviewing Ren and Liang, their family members, teachers and classmates, and concluded that no crime had taken place. In a statement faxed to The Associated Press, the district police bureau said investigators asked Ren about the alleged rape multiple times but found inconsistencies in her description of the circumstances.

In July, Ren took a four-hour train ride to Beijing, joining the legions of petitioners who flock to the capital to seek help from the central government for what they believe are abuses of power by local officials that lead to personal losses such as home seizures or being laid off.

Ren submitted her documents to three petition offices. A security officer at one of the places remarked that she seemed too young to be among the more than 1,000 petitioners who come to the office every day. Two months later they would return to repeat the same cycle: line up, submit papers, wait, he said.

""Just like that, I was hit with a splash of cold water,"" Ren wrote on her online blog that night. ""Hope has pretty much been extinguished.""

The authorities have continued to monitor Ren's movements, she said, more than a year after she first went to the police. On a recent trip to a neighboring city, one man whom she says was trailing her dragged her into a black car when she tried to depart for a third city where she planned to meet with a lawyer.

But Ren remains determined to hold the police, the university and Liang to account.

On the eve of the Aug. 3 protest that would end up being thwarted, Ren posted somber photos of herself wearing a black sun hat and sunglasses, holding up a sign with ""#METOO#"" scrawled on it.

Ren correctly predicted she would face punishment for her actions. Quoting a Chinese proverb, she declared: ""I'd rather be a shattered jade than an unbroken piece of pottery.""

"Speculation about a potential presidential run for former Attorney General Eric Holder has heated up after he announced he would speak at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics’ annual “Politics & Eggs,” an event that many former candidates once attended.

A press release from Holder’s officer announced Wednesday that on June 1, the Obama administration official would be the featured guest speaker at the annual breakfast event.

According to the press release, “the Politics & Eggs series is a forum for presidential candidates, political leaders, and other political analysts and commentators as they visit New Hampshire, home of the nation's first presidential primaries.”

A number of former presidential hopefuls attended the event in the past, including President Donald Trump, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, The Hill reported.

The same day that news broke of his trip to New Hampshire, Al Sharpton also alluded to a presidential bid for Holder while introducing him at the National Action Network’s Annual National Convention in New York.

‘YOU RUN THE DAMN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT’: HOLDER SAYS SESSIONS MUST ‘HAVE THE GUTS’ TO SAY NO TO TRUMP

“Some folks are talking about a guy called Eric who might run for president,” he said. “I’m just saying what I’m hearing. I wouldn’t put him on the spot with a ‘run Eric, run.’ I wouldn’t do that.”

Earlier this week, Holder himself seemed to hint at the likelihood of a run during an interview with MSNBC’S “All in With Chris Hayes.”

When asked if he was “considering it,” Holder replied “I’m thinking about it but I’ve not made any determinations.”

"Suspects awaiting trial in California will now have their bail eliminated, according to a bill signed by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown on Tuesday.

In lieu of bail, suspects will be gauged under a risk-assessment system, although the details of the program, which will take effect in October 2019, were not immediately clear.

Suspects looking at serious, violent felonies won’t be eligible for release prior to trial but the majority of suspects arrested for nonviolent misdemeanors will be let go within 12 hours of being booked, according to the legislation.

The bill gives officials 24 hours to determine whether other suspects should be released before trial. That time can be extended by 12 hours if necessary.

“Today, California reforms its bail system so that rich and poor alike are treated fairly,” Brown said in a statement, according to The Sacramento Bee.

Brown's signature gives the state's Judicial Council, the policy-making body for California's courts, broad authority to reshape pretrial detention policies.

Each county will use the council's framework as a basis to set its own procedures for deciding whom to release before trial, potentially creating a patchwork system based on where a suspect lives.

Senate Bill 10, the formal title of the legislation, was approved by the legislature earlier this month, according to The Sacramento Bee, but faced significant opposition from the bail industry prior to Brown's signing on Tuesday.

"Twelve former senior intelligence officials issued a statement late Thursday criticizing President Trump’s “ill-considered and unprecedented” decision to strip former CIA Director John Brennan’s security clearance.

“The president’s action regarding John Brennan and the threats of similar action against other former officials has nothing to do with who should and should not hold security clearances — and everything to do with an attempt to stifle free speech,” the statement reads.

“As individuals who have cherished and helped preserve the right of Americans to free speech — even when that right has been used to criticize us — that signal is inappropriate and deeply regrettable.”

Among the signers are six former CIA directors -- including retired Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, who was a potential candidate for secretary of state in the early days of the Trump administration.

Also in the group: five former deputy directors of the CIA, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, whose name reportedly appeared on a White House list of ex-officials who may soon join Brennan in losing their security clearances.

""As individuals who have cherished and helped preserve the right of Americans to free speech — even when that right has been used to criticize us — that signal is inappropriate and deeply regrettable."" - The joint statement from 12 former intelligence officials.

The dozen stressed that while they don’t necessarily agree with comments made by Brennan, who’s become a frequent guest on liberal news channels, they believe he has the right to voice them.

The statement came just a day after the White House revoked Brennan’s security clearance following a review of access granted to several top Obama-era intelligence and law enforcement officials.

The Trump administration said Brennan “has a history that calls his credibility into question,” and accused him of “leveraging” the clearance to make “wild outbursts” and claims about the administration.

“The president has a constitutional responsibility to protect classified information and who has access to it, and that’s what he’s doing is fulfilling that responsibility in this action,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said.

In a series of tweets, Trump also tweeted comments critical of Brennan, including that he “has gone off the deep end”.

"A hearing to sentence former national security adviser Michael Flynn on charges of lying to the FBI has been delayed yet again – a sign that Flynn could still be cooperating in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.

“Due to the status of its investigation, the Special Counsel’s Office does not believe that this matter is ready to be scheduled for a sentencing hearing at this time,” reads a court document filed Tuesday by both Mueller and Flynn’s attorney.

Flynn in December pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to the FBI about his conversations with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition as part of a plea deal with prosecutors.

Both sides said they will “provide a status report” within 30 days.

This is the fourth time sentencing has been delayed, even as Flynn’s team has signaled they are ready to conclude the case. In July, a lawyer for Flynn said the retired Army lieutenant general was “eager” to wrap up and proceed to sentencing.

“General Flynn very much does want to bring this chapter to a close,” Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said during a court hearing with U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan in July.

FLYNN 'EAGER' TO PROCEED TO SENTENCING AFTER MYSTERIOUS DELAYS

In July, Sullivan demanded information about why both sides had repeatedly asked for Flynn’s sentencing to be delayed.

Fueling intrigue in the case is a report from the House Intelligence Committee earlier this year stating that former FBI Director James Comey testified to the committee that FBI agents did not believe that Flynn intentionally lied about talks with Russia’s ambassador.

Comey has suggested that his testimony about Flynn had been misunderstood, saying “someone misunderstood something I said. I didn’t believe that and didn’t say that.”

But the House report also states that then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said the FBI didn’t “detect deception” from Flynn in the interview.

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sought to arrange Pentagon and State Department consulting contracts for her daughter’s friend, prompting concerns of federal ethics rules violations.

Clinton in 2009 arranged meetings between Jacqueline Newmyer Deal, a friend of Chelsea Clinton and head of the defense consulting group Long Term Strategy Group, with Pentagon officials that involved contracting discussions, according to emails from Clinton’s private server made public recently by the State Department. Clinton also tried to help Deal win a contract for consulting work with the State Department’s director of policy planning, according to the emails.

Deal is a close friend of Chelsea Clinton, who is vice chair of the Clinton Foundation. Emails between the two were included among the thousands recovered from a private email server used by the secretary of state between 2009 and 2013. Chelsea Clinton has described Deal as her best friend. Both Clintons attended Deal’s 2011 wedding.

Government cronyism, or the use of senior positions to help family friends, is not illegal. However, the practice appears to violate federal ethics rules that prohibit partiality, or creating the appearance of conflicts of interest.

Specifically, the Code of Federal Ethics states that government employees “shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual.” Pentagon ethics guidelines also call for avoiding actions that would create even the appearance of improper behavior or conflicts of interest.

"The late Sen. John McCain's life and legacy will be honored with several special memorial services throughout the week. Government officials, members of the military and McCain's immediate family will travel from Arizona to Washington, D.C., to pay tribute to the veteran and politician.

McCain died Saturday at age 81 after a year-long battle with brain cancer, leaving behind a decades-long legacy in politics which included presidential runs.

While not everyone always agreed with McCain's points of view, many could share appreciation that he loved his country.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of McCain's closest friends told Fox News' Sean Hannity Monday he especially appreciated hearing kind words from those who disagreed with the Arizona senator's politics.

JOHN MCCAIN'S US SENATE SEAT: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

""The fact that people say good things about [McCain] now, I appreciate, but the family appreciates it,"" Graham said, earlier praising McCain's ""romantic view of the nation; it never died. He loved America ... [he was] willing to die for it.""

Over the next several days, members from both sides of the aisle will pay tribute to McCain. Here's a look at the scheduled events.

Aug. 29

McCain lies in state at the Arizona State Capitol Museum. He's the third person to lie in state in the rotunda in the last 40 years — following in the footsteps of Arizona State Sen. Marilyn Jarrett in 2006 and Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens in 1980.

A 11 a.m. MST ceremony, which includes remarks from Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and former U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl, is held in the state.

JOHN MCCAIN'S MILITARY CAREER, FROM HIS TIME AS A VIETNAM WAR POW TO ROLE IN PASSING DEFENSE BILL

Around 3 p.m. MST, the Capitol is opened to members of the public who want to pay their respects. The viewing will go on as long as people are waiting in line, Rick Davis, McCain's former presidential campaign manager, says.

Aug. 30

Arizonans line the 50-mile stretch of Interstate 17 as Arizona National Guard personnel and a motorcade makes its way through Phoenix to a memorial service at North Phoenix Baptist Church.

McCain's wife, Cindy, arrives at the Arizona State Capitol at 9 a.m. MST to pay her respects.

An hour later, a memorial service takes place at the church.

""Senator McCain’s family and friends, along with state, local and tribal officials, and business and civic leaders from across Arizona have been invited to attend the service. In addition, about 1,000 seats have been made available to the public,"" according to funeral information listed on McCain's official website.

JOHN MCCAIN'S POLITICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS

Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to speak at the service.

As the ceremony concludes, McCain's body will depart Arizona for the last time. The casket is placed on a plane at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, departing for Washington, D.C.

Aug. 31

Another viewing is held at the U.S. Capitol ahead of a final memorial service at the Washington National Cathedral, which takes place at 11 a.m. ET.

Sept. 1

At 8:30 a.m. ET, McCain's casket is moved by members of the Armed Forces to a motorcade, which takes him to the Washington National Cathedral.

""The motorcade will pause at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial where Mrs. Cindy McCain will lay a ceremonial wreath honoring all whose lives were lost during the Vietnam War. The public is welcome to line the procession route along Constitution Avenue to pay their respects to Senator McCain,"" according to McCain's website.

Then at 10 a.m. ET, a private service is held for family, friends, colleagues and various other political leaders. Vice President Mike Pence will likely attend the funeral.

Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who blocked McCain's own White House ambitions, are expected to take the mic and say a few words at some point during the ceremony.

"Vice President Mike Pence – and “the field” – lead offshore bookmaking picks as the White House mole behind the anonymous bombshell New York Times op-ed blasting President Trump.

Pence was listed at 2-to-3 odds on the site MyBookie as the fifth column official who claims to be working behind the scenes to stop some of Trump’s policies that they find wrongheaded.

The biggest favorite, at 1-3 odds, is “the field,” someone not listed among the 18 administration officials listed by the Costa Rica-based operation.

At 2-to-3 odds, a winning bettor investing $1 would profit 66 cents. At 1-to-3, a gambler wagering $1 would net 33 cents with a win.

“What tipped us off was ‘lodestar,’ “ MyBookie head oddsmaker David Strauss said of Pence. “When you search members of the administration (who have used that word) only one name comes up – and that name is Mike Pence. He’s used in multiple speeches this year.”

The other 17 named potential moles, listed by MyBookie, are: Education Secretary Betsy Devos (2-to-1), Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (4-to-1), Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin (4-to-1), chief of staff John F. Kelly (4-to-1), Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (5-to-1), Attorney General Jeff Sessions (5-to-1), Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke (6-to-1), Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue (6-to-1), Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross (7-to-1) Labor Secretary Alex Acosta (7-to-1), HHS Secretary Alex Azar (8-to-1), HUD Secretary Ben Carson (8-to-1), VA Secretary Robert Wilkie (8-to-1), Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen (10-to-1), Ivanka Trump (12-to-1) and Jared Kushner (12-to-1).

Hours after MyBookie posted numbers, Canada-based Bovada issued its own Trump-leak odds and listed embatted AG Sessions as its favorite at 5-to-2.

He was followed by Pence (3-to-1), Kelly (4-to-1), Mattis (4-to-1), UN Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley (10-to-1), “Javanka” (15-to-1), Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats (15-to-1), White House counsel Don McGahn (15-to-1), Melania Trump (50-to-1) and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway (50-to-1).

Bovada listed President Trump, himself, as the potential mole and Times writer at 25-to-1.

The site didn’t list a “field” option, and the bet is only good if the Times confirms its source by Dec. 31, 2020.",politics
"Is there anything sadder than the sight of progressives solemnly going through their borking rituals when nobody cares? That’s what happened Sunday, when activists sought to mobilize the public to keep Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court. From Toledo to San Francisco, protesters dutifully showed up with “Kava-NOPE” placards, “Unite for Justice” T-shirts and, of course, their signature “Handmaid’s Tale” red frocks, meant to symbolize Judge Kavanaugh as an instrument of the patriarchy.

The website Common Dreams called the protest “the largest of its kind in U.S. history.” But it barely registered a blip. All that sound and fury signifying one thing: They don’t have the votes.

How different this is from the original performance three decades back. Say what you will about Ted Kennedy, but when a demagogue was needed he was the man for the job. Within 45 minutes of Ronald Reagan’s announcement that Robert Bork was his pick to replace the retiring Justice Lewis Powell on the high court, Kennedy introduced him to America this way:

“Robert Bork’s America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens’ doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, artists would be censored at the whim of government, and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is often the only protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy.”

"Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was jailed Friday after a federal judge revoked his $10 million bail based on new witness tampering charges brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Washington, D.C., Federal District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sent the onetime power player to jail pending trial moments after he pleaded not guilty to the charges, brought against him and his associate, Konstantin Kilimnik of Moscow.

Mueller accused the pair of obstructing justice in the investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in 2016.

Kilimnik was not in court on Friday. He is reportedly in Moscow.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she ""struggled with this decision."" She said the legal standard at play was whether he was a ""danger"" to the public, meaning was there the possibility of Manafort committing future crimes if allowed to remain out of jail.

The judge rejected the defense's arguments that there was no clear order from the court over who the defendant could and could not contact while preparing for trial. Jackson said she could not ""draft a clear enough order"" to cover all current and future contacts.

""You have abused the trust placed in you six months ago,"" Jackson said to Manafort, adding that she could not ""turn a blind eye"" to the special counsel's new allegations of witness tampering while under order not to do so.

Jackson blasted Manafort, stating that he has treated much of the legal proceedings over the past several months as just another ""marketing exercise.""

Manafort's trial before Jackson is expected to take place in September. He is also facing charges brought by Mueller in another federal court, and will appear for that case in August.

Manafort was not handcuffed while in the courtroom and did not speak, but turned briefly back to his wife after the order was issued from the bench. He was then led away by marshals, where he will be processed under federal custody.

It is unclear, at this point, which jail Manafort will be taken to.

'Mr. Manafort is innocent and nothing about the latest allegation changes our defense. We will do our talking in court,' - Manafort spokesman

The filings last week, signed by Mueller, alleged that Manafort and Kilimnik “knowingly and intentionally attempted to corruptly persuade another person…with intent to influence, delay, and prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding.”

Mueller’s third superseding indictment against Manafort came just days after the special counsel accused the former campaign chairman of witness tampering.

Kilimnik, 48, has previously declined to comment on the allegations. He also has denied being connected to Russian intelligence agencies.

A spokesperson for Mueller declined to comment on Friday's development.

A Manafort spokesman defended his client, calling him “innocent.”

Manafort, 69, has maintained his innocence. The spokesman, Jason Maloni, said last week that Manafort and his team of attorneys were reviewing the new charges.

“Mr. Manafort is innocent and nothing about the latest allegation changes our defense,” Maloni said. “We will do our talking in court.”

According to documents filed in federal court, Manafort reached out to would-be witnesses in February after his superseding indictment was unsealed. Manafort allegedly tried to make at least three phone calls and send at least two encrypted text messages to a potential witness “in an effort to secure materially false testimony…” the special counsel claimed.

The court documents said that the person was trying to avoid contact with Manafort and “understood Manafort’s outreach to be an effort to ‘suborn perjury.’”

The special counsel said Manafort's actions violate federal law, and therefore violate the terms of his pretrial release. Manafort’s past charges remain.

“The five previously charged counts against Manfort remain unchanged: conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading FARA [Foreign Agent Registration Act] statements, and false statements,” the special counsel’s spokesman said in a statement last week.

Manafort's cases are being heard in both the U.S. District Court in D.C., and the Eastern District of Virginia, by Judge T.S. Ellis III, who has proven to be more sympathetic to Manafort than Jackson.

Last month, Ellis blasted the special counsel's team, suggesting federal investigators are only after Manafort to find information on Trump.

""You don't really care about Mr. Manafort,” U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III told Mueller’s team. “You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever.""

He added: ""C'mon man!""

"A federal judge in Washington threatened to hold Attorney General Jeff Sessions in contempt of court Thursday after halting the deportation of a mother and daughter who were sent home in the middle of appealing their removal.

U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan learned Thursday that the two were on a plane headed to Central America after the Justice Department and the American Civil Liberties Union agreed Wednesday to delay their deportation until 11:59 p.m. the following day, the Washington Post reported.

“This is pretty outrageous,” he said according to the Post. “That someone seeking justice in the U.S. court is spirited away while her attorneys are arguing for justice for her?”

Officials reportedly said the plane was on its way back to the U.S. later in the day.

The woman — identified in court as Carmen — is a plaintiff in an ACLU lawsuit filed this week over efforts to prevent immigrants from seeking asylum due to domestic and gang violence in their home countries.

Sullivan said any delay in bringing them back would be intolerable and that Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen should argue why they shouldn't be held in contempt of court if they failed to comply.

The DOJ declined to comment. DHS told Fox News that “in compliance with the court’s order, upon arrival in El Salvador, the plaintiffs did not disembark and were promptly returned to the United States.”

Jennifer Chang Newell, managing attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement that the administration’s actions were putting immigrants in “grave danger.”

“In its rush to deport as many immigrants as possible, the Trump administration is putting these women and children in grave danger of being raped, beaten, or killed,” her statement read. “We are thrilled the stay of removal was issued but sickened that the government deported two of our clients — a mom and her little girl — in the early morning hours. We will not rest until our clients are returned to safety.”

"A small airplane or engine-driven recreational aircraft crashed Sunday on a rugged and scenic mountain south of Reno, igniting a wildfire in Nevada that officials feared could climb uphill toward the Mount Rose Ski Tahoe resort.

The fire was reported about 1:40 p.m. Sunday on Slide Mountain in the Mount Rose Wilderness and quickly grew to 20 acres, Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District spokesman Adam Mayberry said.

Washoe County sheriff’s officials began a rescue operation, while the Nevada Division of Forestry, U.S. Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service firefighters headed to the scene.

The type of aircraft that crashed was not immediately known, but the area near Bowers Mansion is popular for gliders and small recreational aircraft, officials said.

It was so steep that rescuers could not immediately get to the wreckage to reach possible survivors or identify the aircraft, Mayberry and sheriff’s spokesman Bob Harmon said.

The first firefighting efforts were conducted using helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, Mayberry said.

Hikers were advised to leave the remote area. Old Highway 395 was restricted to residential traffic and emergency vehicles.

There was no report about an inbound or outbound commercial aircraft missing or being lost on radar, Reno-Tahoe International Airport spokesman Brian Kulpin said.

It's now less risky to get frisky — in public — in Guadalajara.

Mexico's second-largest city has made it harder to police sexual activity in places like parks, alleys, entertainment venues and cars by ordering cops to look the other way most of the time.

Proponents say the change protects the publicly amorous from being shaken down by bribe-hungry officers, a common practice, while critics worry that it could encourage lewd acts in full view of people just going about their day.

Under the modification to the Policing and Good Government Code passed in August, public sexual acts continue to be an administrative offense, sanctioned by a fine or brief detention. The change is that officers can only intervene in such dalliances if they've received a specific complaint from a third party who feels uncomfortable.

""The only thing we added is that for police to detain that couple, a citizens' request is required,"" said Guadalupe Morfin, a city councilor who proposed the measure. She argued that it would discourage police corruption, refocus officers on more serious offenses and not lead to any increase in lewd behavior.

""Nobody wants there to be people having sex in public in sight of boys and girls,"" Morfin said. ""That is not educational. It is troublesome.""

But Livier Martinez of the conservative National Action Party, the only council member to vote nay, argued that there are other ways to tackle corruption. It flouts Jalisco state civil code articles on morality and exhibitionism, she added, and may leave police unsure what they can and cannot do in such cases.

""I don't understand limiting a police officer from being able to act to prevent a crime,"" Martinez said. ""And second: It's not at all pleasant to go around seeing (people) in the street having sexual relations in parks or in vacant lots, or in ... alleys.""

Stumbling across a couple having sex in public is not a daily occurrence in Guadalajara or elsewhere in Mexico, for that matter. However many young people live with their parents into adulthood, have no privacy at home and don't have the money to pay for by-the-hour motels that are all over the place.

There are no reliable statistics to say how common public sex actually is, in part because such cases almost never make it into the judicial system. Instead, they're settled on the street by bribing cops to avoid a trip to the station.

What are very common, however, are stories — especially from young people — of police demanding bribes over more tame behavior that's well short of intercourse and would be better described as ""making out.""

""Sometimes they're not even having sex in public, just kissing or things like that. But (police) do it to get money, to take advantage of this,"" said Andrea Quintana, a student in Guadalajara. ""So I think it's good that now they have to have proof that someone was really doing something bad to have to take them away.""",world
"A woman who was killed after an alligator dragged her into a golf course lagoon in South Carolina was trying to protect her pet border collie during their daily walk, investigators revealed Monday, identifying her as 45-year-old Cassandra Cline.

The lagoon was across the street from her vacation home in a private resort on Hilton Head Island.

The Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office received a call around 9:30 a.m. about a possible alligator attack near a lagoon in Sea Pines Plantation, the resort community where Cline was vacationing, as Fox News previously reported. Officers arrived and discovered the woman’s body inside the lagoon.

According to witnesses, Cline was walking her dog when an alligator, about 8 feet long, “attacked and pulled” her into the water. Security staff also viewed surveillance video of the attack, South Carolina Department of Natural Resources spokesman Capt. Robert McCullough told The Post and Courier.

“She was walking the dog near the lagoon and the alligator came out of the water and tried to get the dog,” David Lucas, a spokesman for the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, said. “The lady tried to rescue the dog and a maintenance worker ran over to help.”

Both were trying to save the dog, but the alligator dragged the woman into the water, he said.

The alligator later was found and killed, Lucas said.

It’s common practice to kill an alligator when one gets reported for an attack or other aggressive behavior, said McCullough. He said it will take some time before authorities determine if the alligator shot Monday is the one that killed Cline.

A neighbor was caring for the dog Monday afternoon, sitting on Cline’s front porch. She declined to comment other than to say the dog was unharmed.

Thomas DiMaio, who rents a house across the street from the scene of the attack, said he heard shrieks while he was in the shower but thought they were a bird. He went outside a half hour later to find a crowd gathering beside the road, where a bag of dog treats Cline had been carrying, one of her shoes and her hat dotted a trail leading to the water.

“It’s really sad,” said DiMaio, who often chatted with Cline as she walked her dog past the vacation home he’s rented for several weeks in the Sea Pines Resort. “She didn’t have any children. The dog was her child, I guess.”

He said Cline and her husband divided their time between Hilton Head and their home near Syracuse, New York. DiMaio said he would see Cline and her dog walking two or three times daily, and the woman often carried a bag of treats she would feed to her pet.

“She was a very pleasant woman,” DiMaio said. “Very friendly.”

Alligator attacks on humans are extremely rare, Lucas said.

Since 1976, there have only been about 20 attacks on people in the state, he said. Until 2016, none of those attacks had been fatal. In 2016, a 90-year-old woman wandered away from a Charleston assisted living facility and was found dead in a pond.

McCullough said Cline was the second person to die from an alligator attack in South Carolina history.

Residents of this resort island off the coast near the South Carolina-Georgia line say alligators are a fairly common sight — especially in the water hazards dotting Hilton Head’s golf courses.

“We’re cautious, but not necessarily scared,” said Roy Sokotowski, who has owned a retirement home at Sea Pines for seven years. “Everybody knows if you have a small dog, you don’t let them get near the water. I don’t get near the water without looking for their eyeballs.”

Barbara Brigham walks her dog, Pippen, along the same golf course — always making sure it’s on a leash. She’s heard of other people’s dogs going missing on the island, but never of an alligator attacking a person.

More than a year ago, Brigham said, she was out walking when a gator emerged from a pond in front of her.

“It looked at me and I looked at it and we both ran in opposite directions,” she said.

Sea Pines Living posted on its Facebook page to confirm the woman’s death.

“Sea Pines CSA is actively working with local authorities to ensure necessary access to the site while the investigation is underway. At this time, little information is available about the individual or incident. We are extremely saddened by this news and will share information with the community as it is made available,” the post read.

The resort is in the southern third of Hilton Head Island, located along 5,000 oceanfront acres, according to its website.

"President Trump on Monday said he plans to terminate the existing North American Free Trade Agreement, as he announced a new tentative agreement between the United States and Mexico that he described as ""one of the largest trade deals ever made.""

""I'll be terminating the existing deal and going into this deal,"" the president said in the Oval Office, calling it a ""big day for trade.""

But the president said Monday “we’ll see” if Canada can still be part of the trade pact, leaving open the possibility of separate agreements.

""We are starting negotiations with Canada pretty much immediately,"" Trump said.

Trump, sitting at the Resolute Desk, put Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on his speaker phone as the press watched in the Oval Office. The Mexican president, speaking through a translator, congratulated the negotiators on both sides and expressed hope the United States and Canada would come to an agreement.

Later, the White House said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau congratulated Trump. ""The leaders discussed US - Canada trade and agreed to continue productive conversations,"" White House officials said.

Earlier in the day, Trump said he wanted to get rid of the name “NAFTA” because it has bad connotations. He said he planned to call the deal the ""United States-Mexico Trade Agreement"" instead.

The United States Trade Representative called the U.S.-Mexico deal a “preliminary agreement in principle, subject to finalization and implementation.”

“They used to call it NAFTA, we are going to call it the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement, and we will get rid of the name NAFTA,” Trump said. “It has a bad connotation because the United States was hurt very badly by NAFTA.”

Trump on Monday called it ""one of the largest trade deals ever made."" The U.S. and Mexico have been working to resolve key differences on issues ranging from automobiles to energy.

According to a fact sheet from the United States Trade Representative, the agreement includes new rules of origin to incentivize manufacturers to source goods and materials in North America – including requiring 75 percent of auto content be made in the United States and Mexico.

Officials in Canada, though, on Monday still expressed optimism over a deal.

“Canada is encouraged by the continued optimism shown by our negotiating partners,” a spokesman for Canada's minister of foreign affair, Chrystia Freeland, said Monday. “Progress between Mexico and the United States is a necessary requirement for any renewed NAFTA agreement.”

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump often railed against the trade pact as “the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere.”

Trump and Peña Nieto have been working for the past five weeks to iron out their bilateral differences so Canada can rejoin the talks to update NAFTA. The U.S. and Mexico wanted to finalize an agreement this month so that it can be signed ahead of Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s inauguration in December.

One of the biggest issues on the negotiating table deals with car manufacturing jobs, as the Trump administration pushes for a deal that would boost factory employment in the U.S.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Mexican Secretary of Economy Idelfonso Guajardo were seen walked together Monday into the White House without talking to reporters. The delegation also included Jesus Seade, a World Trade Organization veteran tapped by Lopez Obrador as his future chief trade negotiator.

The U.S. on Thursday agreed to keep the 2.5 percent tariff currently applied under World Trade Organization rules if the cars are made at factories that already exist, which leaves open the possibility that automobiles that are built at new plants could face tariffs of 20 percent to 25 percent.

Trump has also signaled that he is open to negotiating trade deals with Mexico and Canada separately, while both countries have said they want to keep the three-nation trade deal that dates back to 1994.

Earlier in August, Trump threatened Canada with auto tariffs if the U.S. and Canada can't forge a deal.

""Canada must wait,"" Trump tweeted. ""Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high. Will tax cars if we can't make a deal!""

Canada responded with a statement Friday night, saying: ""Our focus is unchanged. We'll keep standing up for Canadian interests as we work toward a modernized trilateral NAFTA agreement.""

Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canada's foreign minister, added: ""We're glad Mexico and the U.S. continue to work out their bilateral issues. It's the only way we'll get to a deal.""

"Officials in Arizona said Tuesday there are problems with voting machines in several polling places that are preventing people from being able to cast ballots in the state's primary elections.

Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said Tuesday that his office, in the state's most populous county, learned of the issues Monday afternoon.

""This is not a hiccup, this is a serious concern where lots of voters in Maricopa County are not able to get voting,"" Fontes said.

The contractor hired to set up voting machines in the Phoenix area apparently failed to send enough technicians, leaving several polling places out of operation. Fontes says he sent his staff to as many locations as possible to make fixes.

Fontes says the contractor didn't set up the machines on time. More than 100 calls from voters have reported problems Tuesday.

Fontes says he had expected up to 250 locations not being operational by Tuesday morning, though only four sites were down by 10 a.m.

According to ABC 15 in Arizona, some voters say they were turned away from the polls because of tehnical and computer issues.

One frustrated voter, Ben Saylor, told the Associated Press he arrived at his polling place in north Phoenix and was told the equipment would not be set up until lunchtime. He was directed to a vote-anywhere polling station and also was told he would have to cast a provisional ballot.

""If you're a registered citizen, and you have the right to vote, there should be no such thing as a provisional ballot,"" Saylor said.

Among the elections taking place Tuesday is the Republican primary to replace outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake.

In the race, two-term Rep. Martha McSally has emerged as the frontrunner as she fends off challenges from the right from former state Sen. Kelli Ward and Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

In the state’s governor’s race, President Trump has endorsed the re-election effort of Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, who is facing a challenge Tuesday from former Secretary of State Ken Bennett.

“Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona is doing a great job,"" Trump said. ""It would be really nice to show your support tomorrow by voting for him in Tuesdays Primary. Doug is strong on Crime, the Border, and our Second Amendment. Loves our Military & our Vets. He has my full and complete Endorsement.”

Meanwhile, Ducey is expected to appoint someone soon to fill the seat of the late-Sen. John McCain, who died Saturday.

In his final state of the union address Monday, outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto blamed surging violent crime in Mexico on the inability of state and local police to handle the smaller gangs that emerged following the capture of cartel leaders.

Pena Nieto, who leaves office with historically low approval ratings, sidestepped blame for poor economic growth and rising debt during his six-year term, and he warned Mexicans not to turn to a foreign policy of ""indifference.""

His successor, left-leaning Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who takes office Dec. 1, has pledged to refrain from any kind of intervention in the affairs of other countries, in contrast to Pena Nieto, who has sought out solutions to Venezuela's economic and political crisis. Non-intervention was a bedrock of Mexico's foreign policy before 2000.

""Don't confuse non-intervention with indifference to what is happening in the world,"" Pena Nieto warned.

Apart from corruption scandals, one of the things that has reduced Pena Nieto's approval ratings is Mexico's unabated gang-fueled violence.

The president said the federal government ""had success in significantly reducing the capacity and size"" of criminal gangs.

""Unfortunately, this weakening brought with it smaller criminal groups, without there being the capacity on the local level to effectively confront them,"" Pena Nieto said. While local police in most parts of Mexico have long been ill-trained, poorly equipped and often corrupt, critics say Pena Nieto has done little to strengthen federal law enforcement,

Mexico had 25 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017, the highest since comparable records began being kept in 1997, and higher than at the height of the drug war in 2011. Pena Nieto took office in 2012.

""Regarding law enforcement and security in this administration, little was done, much was abandoned and even less groundwork was laid,"" wrote newspaper columnist Alejandro Hope.

He noted there was very little increase in security budgets, federal police strength or the military under the current administration.

The economy was another weak spot for Pena Nieto. While growth in tourism — in part attracted by a weaker peso — was a bright spot, the economy as a whole lagged.

Pena Nieto presided over a devaluation of almost 50 percent in the Mexican peso, and the economy grew by an anemic average of 2.1 percent annually in his first five years in office.

Government debt, meanwhile, rose from about 33.8 of GDP in 2012 to an estimate of 45.4 percent of GDP by mid-2018.

Pena Nieto claimed he was leaving ""a manageable and declining level of debt.""

""When my administration ends, I will have fulfilled 97 percent of the promises I made to the public,"" Pena Nieto said.",world
"Arizona Republicans go to the polls Tuesday to decide who will be the winner of one of the most bruising primaries this election season, as candidates fight to get the party's nod to replace outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake.



In the race, two-term Rep. Martha McSally has emerged as the frontrunner as she fends off challenges from the right in the forms of former state Sen. Kelli Ward and Sheriff Joe Arpaio. But whoever wins the primary will face a tough Democratic challenge as Democrats eye the state as one that can be flipped in November.



While McSally is the establishment favorite, she has also taken a tough stance on immigration, backing Trump’s border wall and focusing much of her campaign on border issues. Despite Flake’s outspoken opposition to the president, none of his challengers has followed his example, and all three have expressed support for Trump.

“I’ve got the strongest voting record with President Trump long before I was running in the Senate,” McSally told Fox News this month, although she had criticized Trump during the 2016 election.



Ward has long been a populist voice in the state, where she had launched a 2016 challenge against Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. But Ward’s campaign has been damaged by the candidacy of Arpaio, whose entry into the race meant Ward had to cover her own right flank rather than focus on McSally.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: CANDIDATES STILL COUNT



Arpaio served six terms as sheriff of Maricopa County and became a national figure due to his stance on immigration and crime. He lost his 2016 re-election bid after being convicted of contempt of court for continuing racial profiling in his department’s hunt for illegal immigrants.



He was pardoned last year by Trump, who repeatedly praised Arpaio during his presidential campaign.



McSally has also been helped by Trump, who has not yet got involved in the race by backing one of her more right-wing opponents. A number of polls show McSally with a significant lead over her two opponents.



For this reason Fox News Power Rankings released this week found that McSally’s more open path to the nomination strengthens her and weakens her likely opponent, Rep. Krysten Sinema, for the general election. As a result, the race rating has been changed from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up.”



The primary race has been noted for its tendency to turn nasty.



McSally and Ward traded jabs during a July debate at The Arizona Republic, hitting each other over credentials and who has more solid policy positions. The attacks also got personal at one point.

“And you know, I’m not a trained killer,” Ward said in a reference to McSally’s military service. “I am a trained problem-solver. I’m a trained healer. And I think that’s what we need in Washington.”

Ward’s husband has also said that Arpaio, 86, is unlikely to live long enough to serve out a full-term.

“They’re bringing that out. How much lower can you get?” Arpaio said.

McSally, ahead in the polls, has already started to turn her attention to Sinema, and released an ad this week hitting Sinema for protesting in a pink outfit while McSally served in the military after 9/11.



“While we were in harm’s way in uniform, Kyrsten Sinema was protesting us in a pink tutu and denigrating our service,” McSally says.



Sinema, meanwhile, said that the ad was a sign McSally was struggling in the primary.



""If Congresswoman McSally is struggling this much to win what should have been an easy primary, it's hard to imagine what level she'll stoop to next,"" James Owens, Sinema's spokesman, said in a statement to The Arizona Republic.

"Tuesday was a lucky day for Imran Awan, the former IT administrator for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. A federal judge sentenced him to three months of supervised release and no fine for one count of bank fraud – sparing him any jail time.

Awan could have faced much more serious charges and a long prison sentence if he had been tried and convicted on accusations that he ran a spy ring inside Congress and stole congressional computer equipment.

Yet stunningly, Awan was not charged with those crimes. Instead, federal prosecutors ignored their own compelling evidence implicating him in the spy ring and exonerated him.

This is what happens when the establishment and the mainstream media collude to cover up a Democratic scandal.

Awan, who pleaded guilty last month to a single charge of making a false statement to obtain a home equity loan, could have been sentenced to up to six months in jail on that plea at his sentencing Tuesday.

Just read the FBI affidavit used to indict Awan and you’ll plainly see that even a prosecutor working on his or her first case wouldn’t have had any trouble getting a conviction for bank fraud against him.

However, the Justice Department opted to plea the charges against Awan down to one count of making a false statement on a home equity loan application – a crime that that allowed Awan to wire $283,000 to Pakistan.

In return for that sweetheart plea deal, the Justice Department got a cover-up.

The more than 40 members of the US. House of Representatives – all Democrats – who employed Awan and members of his family and associates to handle IT work now won’t have to explain anything in court. Their staffers – even the ones in offices where so much official equipment went missing, including some that showed up in one of Awan’s rental properties – won’t have to testify either.

Now no one will have to explain why Awan and his crew were paid over $4 million by those members of Congress and why so much has been done to hush this up.

There is a lot of evidence indicating that the Awan and his team members were copying data from the computers of House members to the House Democratic Caucus server and even to a private Dropbox account.

Awan and his associates were even tossed off the House system because they provided false information (a fake copy of the Democratic Caucus’ server) to Capitol Police. But incredibly, none of that was used against him in court.

This is clearly a political deal arranged to protect the establishment from further embarrassment and reform.

Before announcing Awan’s sentence Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, who was appointed by President Obama in 2013, called the media coverage of the case “scurrilous” and said that Awan and “suffered sufficiently.”

Instead of being treated like an accused criminal, Awan was treated as a victim.

Anyone who reads my upcoming book ""Spies in Congress: Inside the Democrats' Covered-Up Cyber Scandal,” will understand how just appalling this is, as there is still a lot left to come out on this spy thriller of a case.

If the Justice Department had pursued additional charges against Awan, prosecutors might have taken depositions from House members and their staffers. There could have been court scenes that would have given us a look right into the congressional offices that employed Awan and his associates.

A trial of Awan on charges that he was part of a spy ring collecting information from House members would have necessarily dug into a lot of things the Washington establishment would rather not deal with publicly. It also would have forced investigators to follow the trail to Awan’s native country of Pakistan – something the U.S. intelligence community would rather avoid.

The end result is that Awan, his wife (charges against her were dropped) and his crew are getting off easy, and Congress and the media like it this way for their own reasons.

What’s the big deal?

Outside of the quaint idea that justice should be equal – even for members of Congress, their staffers and contractors – there are a lot of problems inherent in covering up this multifaceted case.

Foreign intelligence agencies must have noticed how easy it was for the Awans to get access to the date and emails of so many members of Congress.

The slap on the wrist that Awan received hardly acts as a deterrent to those who’d like to know what members of Congress are saying behind closed doors.

As any computer security professional will tell you, the weakest part of any system is people. Security won’t be taken seriously if no one pays a price for allowing massive security breaches in Congress.

President Trump’s tweets related to this case were even used as a rationale by Judge Chutkan to let Awan walk out of the courtroom with only three months supervised release.

If there is one takeaway right now it’s that the Trump administration should demand an investigation by the Office of Inspector General into how this plea deal was made. The IG should also look into what actually happened in Congress. This case offers the president the opportunity to expose the swamp to the American people.

By covering this up, the establishment has left a lot to come out that will embarrass Congress, the mainstream media and the Justice Department.",politics
"The New York Post recently reported that “Rosie O’Donnell made illegally over-sized campaign donations to at least five Democratic federal candidates, according to a Post analysis of campaign filings.”

The Post story goes on to state: “The liberal comedian has regularly broken Federal Election Commission rules limiting the total any one person can give to an individual candidate at $2,700 per election. The limit applies separately to primaries, runoffs and general elections.”

If the Post story is accurate, federal prosecutors have an obligation to charge O’Donnell with violating campaign finance law and to put her on trial. And if she’s found guilty, my advice to the sentencing judge would be to give her a sentence including confinement and a sizable fine – just as I received for violating campaign finance law.

If I – a prominent conservative – can be labeled a criminal for donating too much to a campaign, then far-left, Trump-bashing O’Donnell should get the same treatment.

If I must endure being a lifelong felon while O’Donnell gets off scot-free, can we say that Lady Justice is truly blind?

Lots of people in every election give more than they’re supposed to. In other words, campaign finance violations are extremely common. And they are almost never seriously prosecuted.

The New York Post article quoted prominent campaign finance lawyer Jan Witold Baran as saying: “Donors are rarely fined for excess contributions and then only if they are hiding the donations from the recipients.”

I was an exception to the rule and that has made me particularly interested in how campaign finance violations are handled. In the 2012 case, I gave $20,000 over the limit to a single candidate – Wendy Long, a college friend of mine running as a Republican for the U.S. Senate in New York.

For that I was sentenced in U.S. District Court in New York City to eight months of overnight confinement, a $30,000 fine, five years of probation and one day of community service per week for five years. I’m still on probation and still doing the community service, which doesn’t expire until October 2019.

Now Rosie O’Donnell has been caught exceeding the campaign finance limit by giving more than the maximum permitted donation of $2,700 to victorious Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Doug Jones in Alabama, victorious Democratic congressional candidate Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania, and to three other candidates, the Post reported.

O’Donnell’s defense, as she wrote in an email to the Post, is that she didn’t know she was exceeding the limits. She wrote that candidates “should refund the money” if she donated too much, and added that “I just donate assuming they do not accept what is over the limit.”

I find this defense implausible because O’Donnell used four different – though similar –variations of her name and five different addresses.

The way O’Donnell choreographed her contributions clearly suggests that she was trying to conceal the fact that they were all coming from the same person. I suspect she knew she was breaking the law.

But even if O’Donnell was telling the truth, the law doesn’t work like that. Her defense is about as logical as the guy who thinks he can go just as fast as he wants on the highway, and believes that if he’s going too fast the cops can stop him and tell him to slow down. Try that the next time you get stopped and you’ll see it’s a futile defense.

Now in the old days, say the 1980s, if you had told me about O’Donnell’s offense and asked me whether I thought she should go to jail for it, I would have said she should not. Why?

First, because these campaign finance limits don’t make a whole lot of sense. Why set an arbitrary $2,700 limit when millionaires and billionaires can easily get around them and give huge amounts through political action committees?

Second, justice demands that the penalty fit the crime. Campaign finance prosecutions make the most sense when there is corruption involved: when someone is trying to get a quid pro quo, which is to say, get appointed to a position, or obtain favors from candidates upon their election. This was obviously not the case with O’Donnell.

Normally, O’Donnell’s type of offense is punished with community service and a fine. But we are not living in normal types, as my own campaign finance case illustrates.

Mine was a clear instance of politically motivated prosecution. Two indications of that are contained right in my FBI file, which is now in the hands of a congressional oversight committee.

In the FBI file, I’m red-flagged as a political conservative who made a movie critical of President Obama. Why mention this? The FBI did it to signal to the Obama Justice Department and its stooges that I was a political enemy they might want to prosecute.

The FBI also made an initial outlay of $100,000 to investigate my $20,000 case. Again, this is odd. But it is also consistent with a political hit. Clearly the FBI was working in cahoots with Obama-appointed U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and his prosecutorial team in New York City to make sure that they nailed their target.

Finally, the injustice of the case can be seen in the verdict. No American has been even charged, let alone received such a severe penalty, for doing what I did. And no prominent person on the other side of the aisle had a similar case, until O’Donnell’s situation was recently brought to light.

O’Donnell seems by all accounts to have broken the law, and broken it five times. This makes her offense five times worse than mine, in my view.

I’m not saying she deserves five times the penalty I received, but I am saying that assuming the facts are true as reported by the Post – as O’Donnell herself seems to admit – she should receive at least a severe a penalty as mine. She is, after all, a serial or repeat offender and repeat offenses are always taken more seriously than a first and one-time offense.

Yet the same people who are jubilant over my conviction have gone dead silent on O’Donnell. They know my prosecution was political, and they approve. But now they want O’Donnell to get off with the normal treatment that usually goes with offenses uncontaminated by corrupt motives.

Yet justice isn’t just a matter of whether someone broke the law, but also about whether other similarly situated people are treated the same way. If I must endure being a lifelong felon while O’Donnell gets off scot-free, can we say that Lady Justice is truly blind? Of course not.

In an earlier time, President Jimmy Carter would no more dream of locking me up for exceeding a campaign limit than Ronald Reagan would consider locking up left-wing activist Michael Moore for the same offense. It was a kinder, gentler America.

But we don’t live in that America. The Democratic Party has been gangsterized by the likes of President Obama and Hillary Clinton, who were not above using the instruments of the state to put their political adversaries behind bars. And this course of action is generally approved by the progressive left in the media and groups like Media Matters.

There is only one solution to this: Do the same to them! And maybe this will show them that two can play at this game, and that if they don’t want their team being locked up for minor offenses, stop doing this to the other side. Paradoxically, the best hope for a return to civility and normalcy is to prosecute Rosie O’Donnell to the full extent of the law.

The Trump Justice Department should work with the U.S. attorneys in every district that O’Donnell may have broken the law. I’d like to see her face multiple indictments. And I won’t be especially sorry if she suffers the same fate I did, or worse, because I expect that she was one of those who cheered the loudest when I had my sentence read out to me.",politics
"The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld President Trump’s controversial travel ban affecting several mostly Muslim countries, offering a limited endorsement of the president’s executive authority on immigration in one of the hardest-fought battles of this term.

The 5-4 ruling marks the first major high court decision on a Trump administration policy. It upholds the selective travel restrictions, which critics called a discriminatory “Muslim ban” but the administration argued was needed for security reasons.

In a written statement, Trump called the ruling ""a tremendous victory for the American People and the Constitution."" As critics continued to decry the policy as ""xenophobic,"" Trump described the court decision as ""a moment of profound vindication following months of hysterical commentary from the media and Democratic politicians who refuse to do what it takes to secure our border and our country.""

At issue was whether the third and latest version of the administration's policies affecting visitors from five majority Muslim nations – known as travel ban 3.0 – discriminates on the basis of nationality and religion, in the government's issuance of immigrant visas.

CLICK TO READ THE DECISION

Chief Justice John Roberts, who authored the conservative majority opinion, wrote that the order was “squarely within the scope of presidential authority” under federal law.

“The sole prerequisite set forth in [federal law] is that the president find that the entry of the covered aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. The president has undoubtedly fulfilled that requirement here,” he wrote.

Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor was among the court’s four liberals that wrote a dissent.

“This repackaging does little to cleanse [the policy] of the appearance of discrimination that the president’s words have created,” she said. “Based on the evidence in the record, a reasonable observer would conclude that the proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus.”

She and Justice Stephen Breyer took the unusual step of reading their dissents from the bench.

While the policy was upheld, the case was sent back to the lower courts, which were told to rely on the Supreme Court’s interpretation of executive authority.

It was the first significant legal test so far of Trump's policies and power and could lead to a precedent-setting expansion on the limits of presidential authority, especially within the immigration context.

Federal appeals courts in Virginia and California in recent months had ruled against the administration. The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court last December concluded Trump's proclamation, like the two previous executive orders, overstepped his powers to regulate the entry of immigrants and visitors.

But the justices had allowed the current restrictions to be enforced at the Justice Department's request, at least until the case was fully litigated.

The Trump administration also seemed to enjoy a favorable reception before the court during arguments in April. Associate Justice Samuel Alito, during those April arguments, noted that of the 50 or so mostly Muslim majority countries, only five were on the current banned list.

The White House had framed the issue as a temporary move involving national security.

A coalition of groups in opposition called the order blatant religious discrimination, since the countries involved have mostly Muslim populations: Iran, Libya, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Chad was recently removed from the list after the administration said that country had beefed up its information-sharing.

A major sticking point for the justices was navigating how much discretion the president really has over immigration. Courts have historically been deferential in this area, and recent presidents from Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama have used it to deny entry to certain refugees and diplomats, including nations such as Iran, Cuba and North Korea.

A 1952 federal law -- the Immigration and Nationality Act, passed in the midst of a Cold War fear over Communist influence -- historically gives the chief executive broad authority.

It reads in part: ""Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.""

The administration strongly denies this is a ""Muslim ban,"" but federal judges across the country cited statements by then-presidential candidate Trump and his advisers, including a December 2015 campaign press release calling for such restrictions and citing ""hatred"" by ""large segments of the Muslim population.""

The high court’s majority downplayed Trump's campaign statements as a major factor in its decision.

""The issue before us is not whether to denounce the statements,"" wrote Roberts. ""It is instead the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility. In doing so, we must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but also the authority of the Presidency itself.""

Sixteen state leaders led by Texas were among a number of coalitions backing the Trump administration. But Hawaii officials, who filed the appeal contesting all of the president's orders, said the president's policies violate the Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom:

""Any reasonable observer who heard the president's campaign promises, read his thinly justified orders banning overwhelmingly Muslim populations, and observed his administration's persistent statements linking the two, would view the order and each of its precursors as the fulfillment of the president's promise to prohibit Muslim immigration to the United States.""

Trump's first executive order was issued just a week after he took office, and was aimed at seven countries. It triggered chaos and protests across the U.S., as some travelers were stopped from boarding international flights and others detained at airports for hours. Trump modified the order after a federal appeals court refused to allow the ban to be enforced.

""This is not about religion -- this is about terror and keeping our country safe,"" the president said on Jan. 29, 2017.

The next version, unveiled weeks later, dropped Iraq from the list of covered countries and made it clear the 90-day ban covering Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen didn't apply to those travelers who already had valid visas. It also got rid of language that would give priority to religious minorities. Critics said the changes did not erase the legal problems with the ban.

When that second temporary travel ban expired in Sept. 24, it was replaced with Proclamation 9645 -- what the administration said was a country-by-country assessment of security and cooperation with the U.S.

"President Trump, in an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Ainsley Earhardt, insisted he only knew about hush-money payments made by Michael Cohen “later on” despite his ex-lawyer's claims to the contrary, while maintaining they were not campaign funds.

“Later on I knew. Later on. What he did—and they weren’t taken out of the campaign finance, that’s the big thing. That’s a much bigger thing,” Trump said Wednesday. “Did they come out of the campaign? They didn’t come out of the campaign, they came from me.”

The president’s comments come after his former longtime personal attorney and self-described “fixer” entered a guilty plea with federal prosecutors on Tuesday, admitting to violating campaign finance laws by arranging hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal “at the direction” of then-candidate Trump.

The plea deal stated the payments were meant to influence the election -- by covering up affair allegations -- and the campaign was involved.

“I don’t know if you know but I tweeted about the payments,” Trump said in the ""Fox & Friends"" interview, pushing back. “But they didn’t come out of the campaign. In fact, my first question when I heard about it was, did they come out of the campaign, because that could be a little dicey. And they didn’t come out of the campaign and that’s big.”

He added: “But they weren’t .... that’s not even a campaign violation.”

The president was referring to his May 3 tweets regarding his move to reimburse Cohen for the $130,000 payment to Daniels.

“Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA,” Trump tweeted.

“Those agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair,” Trump added, continuing, “…despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll [sic] in this transaction.”

Trump, in those tweets, was referring to a letter written and signed by Daniels in January, stating “with complete clarity” that allegations of an affair with Trump were “completely false.”

Despite admitting to knowing about the payments this week, and on Twitter in May, the president initially said he did not know about the $130,000 transaction.

In May, Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani told Fox News that Trump “didn’t know the details of this until we knew the details of this,” adding that Trump thought it was to cover unspecified “expenses,” following the release of a financial disclosure.

Cohen, who also pleaded guilty to several charges of bank and tax fraud, initially said the money he paid to Daniels came out of his own pocket.

“If you look at President Obama, he had a massive campaign violation but he had a different attorney general and they viewed it a lot differently,” Trump said.

Trump was referring to Obama's 2008 campaign being fined $375,000 by the Federal Election Commission for a series of missing notices for more than 1,300 contributions. They totaled $1.8 million.

But Lanny Davis, Cohen’s attorney, argued that there is little room for interpretation as to whether the president could be in legal trouble.

“There is no question that he’s committed a federal crime,” Davis said on “America’s Newsroom” Wednesday. He also argued that it’s never been settled whether a sitting president can be indicted, despite suggestions to the contrary from Trump allies.

At issue is the Daniels payment as well as the McDougal case, where she was paid $150,000 by the parent company of the National Enquirer for her story about an alleged 2006 affair with Trump, which it never published. Cohen admitted Tuesday to making an excessive campaign contribution and causing an unlawful corporate contribution.

After Cohen's plea deal, Davis also initially said that Trump’s lawyers wrote a letter to Special Counsel Robert Mueller admitting Trump “directed” Cohen to make the payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.

But Davis' team corrected himself to CNN’s John Berman Wednesday, noting he was not talking about a letter to Mueller’s team, but rather the financial disclosure form filed by Trump in May.",politics
"Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing boiled over into a series of tense exchanges late in the evening Wednesday, as high-profile Democrats lined up to hammer the appellate judge with thinly veiled accusations that he was hiding ties to President Trump's inner circle and harbored sympathies for racist policies.

In an especially combative moment late in the day, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., pointedly asked Kavanaugh whether he ever had discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller or his Russia probe with anyone at Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Marc Kasowitz, a former personal attorney to President Trump.

""Be sure about your answer,"" Harris warned. ""I'm asking you a very direct question. Yes or no?""

""I'm not sure I know everyone who works at that law firm,"" Kavanaugh said. ""I'm not remembering, but I'm happy to be refreshed.""

""How can you not remember whether or not you had a conversation about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at that law firm?"" Harris asked, visibly exasperated. ""This investigation has only been going on for so long, sir, so please answer the question.""

""I'm just trying to think -- do I know anyone who works at that firm?"" Kavanaugh eventually replied. ""I'd like to know the person you're thinking of.""

""I think you're thinking of someone and you don't want to tell us,"" Harris shot back, sending the room into a few seconds of near-total silence.

Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee then interjected briefly to defend Kavanaugh, saying that ""this town is full of law firms"" and that they ""are constanly metastaizing, they break off, they form new firms -- they're like rabbits. There's no possible way we can expect this witness to know who populates an entire firm.""

A barrage of protesters erupted in a chant of ""Answer the question"" before being led out by police as Lee spoke. In all, 73 people were arrested and charged for unlawful demonstrations within Senate buildings on Wednesday, including 66 people who were removed from the hearing room during the day, according to Capitol Police officials.

In another dramatic exchange, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., implied Kavanaugh had been open to racial profiling tactics, citing an email exchange between Kavanaugh and a colleague. However, Booker did not provide Kavanaugh a copy of the emails to review while questioning him about it, prompting another objection from Lee, who charged that it was inappropriate to ""cross-examine"" Kavanaugh about documents that he ""can't see.""

Booker countered that when Democrats received the emails, which he said were titled ""racial profiling,"" they were marked ""committee confidential,"" indicating that they contained sensitive information.

""The system is rigged,"" Booker said, arguing that the documents should not have been marked confidential, because they did not contain personal or national security information. ""The process is unfair, unnecessary, unjust, and unprecedented on this committee.""

Lee ultimately agreed that the emails should be released, but that Kavanaugh should still be able to review them: ""There's no reason why this shouldn't be something we can't discuss in public -- I don't know why it was marked 'committee confidential,'"" he said.

Also Wednesday evening, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono pressed Kavanaugh at length about whether he was aware of inappropriate behavior by former 9th Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski when he clerked for Kozinski from 1991 to 1992. Kozinski abruptly retired last year after several woman who had worked as law clerks or colleagues accused him of sexual misconduct that included touching, inappropriate sexual comments and forced viewings of pornography in his chambers.

Hirono, who repeatedly has asked other judicial nominees whether they ever sexually harassed anyone, noted that Kavanaugh and Kozinski had kept in touch after his clerkship, with Kozinski recommending Kavanaugh during his 2006 confirmation hearings for his current job on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

""You saw nothing, you heard nothing, and you obviously said nothing,"" Hirono said, even as Kavanaugh denied being aware of any misconduct by Kozinski and said he would have reported it if he had known.

For the most part, the lengthy hearing focused on Kavanaugh's writings and, in particular, key opinions he authored while serving on the nation's most prestigious appellate court.

At one point, Kavanaugh was asked by Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy about the constitutionality of individual federal judges issuing nationwide injunctions against presidential action -- a phenomenon that has attracted scrutiny after district court judges unilaterally brought temporary halts to President Trump's travel ban and other initiatives. Kavanaugh demurred, saying he could not discuss potential pending issues before the Supreme Court.

""I'm sorry about the circumstances, but we'll get through it."" - Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.

After Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse decried what he said was the improper mixing of partisan politics with legal discussion during the hearing, he reiterated his arguments from Tuesday that Congress often delegates excessive authority to mostly unaccountable executive branch agencies.

WATCH: SASSE UNLOADS ON CONGRESS DURING CONFIRMATION HEARING

In response, Kavanaugh specifically touched on the Obama-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), saying that even if the agency was a good policy idea, its creation was an improper ""departure from historical practice"" because it employed a single director, rather than a committee, who could only be removed by the president for cause.

Kavanaugh wrote an opinion for a three-judge panel striking down the CFPB's structure as unconstitutional in 2016, but was later reversed in part by a 7-3 vote in an unusual en banc review by other justices on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The en banc review found the CFPB's structure to be constitutional, but agreed with Kavanaugh that one of the agency's major interpretive decisions had improperly violated due process requirements.

""A single person can make these enormous decisions?"" Kavanaugh told Sasse on Wednesday, referring to the director of the CFPB. ""From my perspective ... that was an issue of concern.""

The confirmation hearing has been chaotic at times, with Democrats trying to delay the proceedings as they complain they haven't received enough records from Kavanaugh's past work.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell found a way to allow Wednesday’s confirmation hearing to continue into the night, after a brief floor clash with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Schumer had objected to McConnell’s request for the committee to continue meeting after 2 p.m., despite plans to go late. But McConnell, using a parliamentary maneuver, adjourned the Senate for the day -- because committees can meet as long as they like when the Senate is not in session.

KAVANAUGH VOWS TO 'KEEP AN OPEN MIND IN EVERY CASE'

California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s ranking member and the first Democrat to question the nominee, began her questioning of Kavanaugh by referencing the outbursts from protesters: “I'm sorry about the circumstances, but we'll get through it,” she said.

Feinstein asked the nominee about his past case argument that Washington D.C.’s assault weapons ban was unconstitutional. He said he was following the precedent of the Supreme Court, but acknowledged that gun violence posed significant policy concerns.

In his 2011 dissent in a follow-up to the landmark D.C. v. Heller case, Kavanaugh wrote that based on Supreme Court precedent, gun restrictions should be assessed principally by reviewing ""text, history, and tradition,"" rather than a balancing analysis that mainly considers dangers to the public and the government's interest in regulation.

Kavanaugh wrote that there is ""no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction"" between semiautomatic rifles and semiautomatic handguns, rejecting the city's attempt to apply regulations to rifles, other than automatics, that could not constitutionally apply to handguns.

Feinstein also pressed Kavanaugh over the Roe v. Wade court decision regarding abortion. “Well, as a general proposition, I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade,” he said.

Later in the day, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., dismissed Kavanaugh's statements on Roe, saying that describing the case as important ""existing Supreme Court precedent"" was akin to callously introducing a woman as ""my current wife,"" drawing a slight grin from Kavanaugh.

The nominee then stressed that ""precedent on precedent"" has since supported abortion rights, noting that the 1992 Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey explicitly upheld Roe. But when pointedly asked by Blumenthal to vow to never overturn Roe, Kavanaugh reiterated that it would be inappropriate for nominees to the Supreme Court to discuss hypothetical cases during their confirmation hearings -- a view echoed by each sitting Supreme Court justice.

It was a recurring theme for Kavanaugh on the day, as he emphasized that he would remain an impartial jurist despite his personal views, both before and after the confirmation hearings. To argue that he can be trusted to be fair to all litigants, Kavanaugh cited his decision in the 2012 case Hamdan v. United States, in which he overturned the conviction of Osama bin Laden's personal driver, Salim Hamdan. The conviction, Kavanaugh said, violated the Constitution's Ex Post Facto provision by punishing a defendant under a system of military tribunals enacted after his alleged crimes.

“You'll never have a nominee who's ruled for a more unpopular defendant,"" Kavanaugh told senators Wednesday, saying that while Hamdan was a widely reviled Guantanamo Bay detainee, he was still entitled to some constitutional protections.

Feinstein also asked Kavanaugh about past comments regarding investigations involving a president, a key issue amid the Russia probe that has implicated numerous Trump associates. Kavanaugh said he’s never taken a position on the constitutionality of whether a president should be investigated while in office.

In response to later questions from Sasse, Kavanaugh emphasized that ""no one's above the law,"" saying that while any criminal prosecution of a sitting president may face ""timing"" issues, there is no absolute constitutional prohibition against eventually pursuing such a prosecution.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., pressed Kavanaugh about what he knew about the Bush administration’s warrantless surveillance program. Leahy also asked Kavanaugh if a president has a right to pardon himself, a power President Trump has said he believes he has.

“The question of self-pardons is something I have never analyzed,” Kavanaugh replied.

Outbursts from protesters have been a recurring feature since the hearings began. Moments after Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley opened the hearing Wednesday, shouting could be heard from the back of the room: “Sham president, sham justice!” Ironically, at one point, protesters shouted as Kavanaugh discussed how he tried to be respectful in court. ""I’ve tried to be a very collegial judge, I’ve tried to be civil,"" he said.

Kavanaugh served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office in the George W. Bush administration. He also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.

Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch.

The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee.

Republicans command a narrow 51-49 Senate majority. Party leaders have said they hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

The Latest on Pope Francis' trip to Ireland (all times local):

10:35 a.m.

Pope Francis has arrived in Ireland for the first papal visit to the country in almost four decades.

A plane carrying Francis and his entourage landed at Dublin International Airport on Saturday after a two-hour flight from Rome.

Hundreds of thousands are expected to welcome the pope, but there will also be demonstrations and vigils by survivors of clergy sex abuse in a country where attitudes on the Catholic Church are shifting.

Irish Health Minister Simon Harris, who recently played a prominent role in the successful campaign to liberalize the country's strict abortion laws, said it would be a weekend of ""mixed emotions.""

Harris tweeted: ""For many; excitement, for others; feelings of hurt....Whatever your perspective, let's hope for a weekend where reconciliation & healing can commence.""

7:45 a.m.

Pope Francis has departed for Ireland, the first papal visit to that traditionally Roman Catholic country since 1979.

As usual, Francis carried his black leather satchel himself as he climbed the stairs to board an Alitalia A320 on Saturday and greeted the flight crew.

The plane, which also carried his entourage, took off from Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport at 8:30 a.m. local time (0630 GMT.)

The pope's visit to Ireland risks being dominated by criticism over the Catholic Church hierarchy's handling of predator priests who sexually abused children.

The pope is scheduled to return to Rome late Sunday night.

6:00 a.m.

Pope Francis is heading to Ireland as the Catholic Church faces a global crisis for its systemic failures to protect children from clergy sex abuse or to punish bishops who hid the crimes.

Francis was expected to meet with abuse victims on Saturday as part of his 36-hour visit to Dublin, where the Vatican says he will have ""many opportunities"" to speak out about abuse.

His visit is the first by a pope to Ireland in 40 years and is aimed at showing the church understands the problems of ordinary Catholic families.

"Kosovo Albanians on Sunday blocked roads and burned tires on a planned route by Serbia's president in the former Serbian province, further fueling tensions between the two Balkan foes.

During his two-day trip, President Aleksandar Vucic planned to visit a Serb-populated village in central Kosovo on Sunday, but roads leading to the region were blocked by wooden logs, trucks and heavy machinery.

Vucic and his entourage were later stopped by Kosovo police on the road to the Drenica region and were told they couldn't continue for security reasons.

Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj wrote on his Facebook page that he has ""cancelled the permission issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry for Serb President's visit to the Drenica zone.""

""Citizens' security is above all,"" he wrote.

Serbian media said gunfire could also be heard, but those reports couldn't be independently verified. Vucic wasn't under attack.

""I have never been fascinated by someone's hatred. But when someone is so mean, showing some symbols that they believe we get offended by, well they are very mistaken,"" said Vucic, a former ultranationalist. ""Now, I am even more determined to preserve peace, but also to preserve Serb institutions and Serb people"" in Kosovo.

Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic blamed the blockades on former Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers who fought Serb troops in Kosovo during the 1998-99 war for independence.

The conflict ended with NATO intervention, which forced Serbia to pull out of Kosovo. Kosovo unilaterally declared independence in 2008 which Serbia doesn't recognize.

Stefanovic said that security in Kosovo has deteriorated and that gunshots have been reported to Vucic's security guards, ""which is a signal that Serbs are not welcome.""

Stefanovic said that NATO-led KFOR troops and Kosovo police are being tested to provide safe passage for Vucic.

Serbia and Kosovo must mend ties to advance toward European Union membership. The two sides have been engaged in EU-mediated negotiations.

"A demonstration in support of Second Amendment gun rights drew left-wing counter-protesters Saturday in Seattle, forcing dozens of police to keep the two sides separated.

Conservative groups Washington 3 Percenters and Patriot Prayer held their “Liberty or Death” rally outside Seattle City Hall, to oppose a city gun-control initiative, while a group of left-wing organizations rallied nearby.

The left-wingers -- including members of Organized Workers for Labor Solidarity, Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party -- yelled and used cow bells and sirens in an attempt to drown out speeches from the other side.

One person on the gun-rights side, sporting a Donald Trump hat, was treated for an injury at the scene. A police spokesman told the Seattle Times that a total of three men were arrested for misdemeanor assault.

As tensions mounted, additional police arrived, including some in riot gear. Bicycle officers lined up their bikes as a type of moving barrier to keep protesters from entering the street.

The gun-control initiative would expand background checks, raise the age for people buying semi-automatic rifles from 18 to 21, and create standards for safely storing firearms.

On Friday a judge threw out 300,000 signatures necessary to put the initiative on the November ballot on the grounds that it did not meet election-law requirements. The Alliance for Gun Responsibility, the group behind the proposal, has appealed the motion.

Saturday’s protest came two weeks after police in riot gear in Portland, Ore., tried to keep right-wing and left-wing groups apart. The effort mostly succeeded, but police were accused of being heavy-handed, prompting the city's new police chief to order a review of officers' use of force.

"Dozens of MS-13 gang members and affiliates have been hit with charges following a murder and drug trafficking probe, an official in California said.

Two MS-13 gang members were charged with murder in U.S. court and another four with assault. Another 16 people affiliated with MS-13 are facing drug trafficking charges. Additional charges have been filed in state court.

The street gang reportedly terrorized the city of Mendota by taking advantage of an understaffed police department, Sacramento U.S. Attorney McGregor Scott told The Associated Press on Thursday.

WHAT IS MS-13, THE VIOLENT GANG TRUMP VOWED TO TARGET?

Mendota, with a population of roughly 11,000 people, lies 35 miles west of Fresno in California's agriculturally rich Central Valley. Nearly the entire population is Hispanic, with many immigrants from El Salvador.

The probe, according to Scott, also helped solve assaults and killings in Houston, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and New York. A wiretap obtained as part of the probe linked MS-13 gang members to slayings and assaults in those cities, leading to additional people being charged there.

""The nationwide tentacles of this going out from this little town in Fresno County is dramatic,"" he said.

"Two workers plunged seven stories to their deaths early Wednesday when scaffolding collapsed at a Florida construction site near the Walt Disney World Resort, authorities said.

A third worker hung on and managed to climb to safety. The individual sustained minor injuries, according to authorities.

The construction workers were above the sixth floor of a hotel under construction when the “support structure gave away,” Orange County Fire Rescue spokesman Mike Jachles said. The workers were pouring concrete just before the collapse about 4:15 a.m.

""They were on the scaffolding, and for reasons unknown at this time, that support structure gave way, sending two workers plummeting to the ground below. Both died on the scene,” Jachles said. “A third worker managed to hang onto the scaffolding and managed to climb to safety.”

There were about 18 workers at the site of the future JW Marriott Orlando Bonnet Creek resort when the deadly collapse happened. Marriott International previously described the $282 million project as a 16-story building with 516 rooms near Orlando's popular theme parks.

It's owned and developed by DCS Investment Holdings, a private equity group based in West Palm Beach, Florida, which is owned by Dwight C. Schar, co-owner of the Washington Redskins.

A South Korean presidential delegation flew to North Korea on Wednesday for talks to arrange a summit planned later this month and help rescue faltering nuclear diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang.

It's unclear who the South Korean envoys will meet in the North or whether they will see North Korean leader Kim Jong Un before returning to the South later Wednesday.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in said his national security adviser will be carrying a personal letter for Kim. Moon said the envoys are tasked with a crucial role at a ""very important time"" that could determine the prospects for lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.

While pushing ahead with summits and inter-Korean engagement, Seoul is trying to persuade Washington and Pyongyang to proceed with peace and denuclearization processes at the same time so they can overcome a growing dispute over the sequencing of the diplomacy.

Seoul also wants a trilateral summit between the countries, or a four-nation meeting that also includes Beijing, to declare a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War. The U.N. General Assembly in late September would be an ideal date for Seoul, but many analysts see that possibility as low, considering the complications of the process and how far apart the parties currently are.

U.S. officials have insisted that a peace declaration, which many see as a precursor to the North eventually calling for the removal of all U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula, cannot come before North Korea takes more concrete action toward abandoning its nukes. Such steps may include providing an account of the components of its nuclear program, allowing outside inspections and giving up a certain number of its nuclear weapons during the early stages of the negotiations.

The North has accused the United States of making ""unilateral and gangster-like"" demands on denuclearization and holding back on the end-of-war declaration.

South Korean officials said an end-of-war declaration will be among the issues discussed in the meetings between the South Korean envoys and North Korean officials.

""Our government believes that an end-of-war declaration is very much needed while we enter a process toward stabilizing peace in the Korean Peninsula through complete denuclearization,"" said Chung Eui-yong, Moon's national security adviser and the head of the South Korean delegation to Pyongyang, in a news conference on Tuesday.

""We will continue to put in efforts so that an end-of-war declaration can be reached by the end of the year. We are always maintaining close communication with the United States.""

Chung said inter-Korean engagement is a crucial part of the efforts to resolve the nuclear crisis.

""If needed, we should pull forward the negotiations for the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula with the development in relations between the South and North,"" he said.

Any progress could depend on whether Moon's envoys are able to coax a stronger verbal commitment from North Korea on denuclearization to help put the nuclear talks between the United States and Pyongyang back on track.

U.S. President Donald Trump called off a planned visit to North Korea by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month, citing insufficient progress in denuclearization. The resumption of U.S.-North Korea talks sometime before the next inter-Korean summit, which will likely take place in mid-September, could give Moon more to work with when he arrives in Pyongyang.

Considering the difficult circumstances, it's unclear whether Moon's envoys will be able to get anything other than a fixed date for his new summit with Kim.

The two past inter-Korean summits in April and May removed war fears and initiated a global diplomatic push that culminated with a meeting between Kim and Trump in June. But Moon faces tougher challenges heading into his third meeting with Kim with the stalemate in nuclear negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington raising fundamental questions about Kim's supposed willingness to abandon his nukes.

Moon has been aggressively pushing engagement with North Korea in past months, but the lack of progress in nuclear talks could mean an end to the inter-Korean detente.

""Now is a very important time for establishing lasting peace in the Korean Peninsula; that's why special envoys are being sent to North Korea,"" Moon said Monday. ""Peace in the Korean Peninsula goes together with the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and the government is closely examining and carefully managing the situation.""

The Korean War ended with an armistice, leaving the peninsula technically still at war. Moon has made an end-of-war declaration an important premise of his peace agenda with North Korea.",world

"In Burma – the Asian country now called Myanmar by its ruling junta – a brutal military crackdown on the Rohingya minority has led to thousands of deaths and rapes. It has also led to the creation of the largest refugee camp in the world, with almost 1 million people.

This horror has received far too little media coverage, showing that even in our era of instant global communication atrocities can occur in hidden corners of the world. These cry out for exposure and action.

So why is the U.S. State Department even debating whether or not to use the term “genocide” to mark the one-year anniversary of the mass murder and other violence taking place in Burma?

The United Nations Convention on Genocide defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.” These acts include: “Killing … causing serious bodily or mental harm … deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction … imposing measures intended to prevent births … (and) forcibly transferring children.”

Independent observers all agree that the military leaders of Buddhist-majority Burma are committing genocide against the persecuted Rohingyas, a Muslim minority group.

Investigators commissioned by the State Department have assembled 15,000 pages of evidence of killings, gang rapes, villages set on fire and children tossed into rivers and fires.

The atrocities have only subsided in recent months because the vast majority of the Rohingyas – nearly 1 million people – have fled across the border into exile in neighboring Bangladesh, where they huddle in sweltering refugee camps.

Despite this record, the U.S. has so far avoided labeling what has taken place in Burma a “genocide.” Instead, our government prefers the term “ethnic cleansing,” which carries far less weight and makes it harder to impose sanctions on the responsible Burmese government officials.

In the debate over the content of an upcoming speech by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the Rohingya issue, it’s clear that the issue of whether or not to use the term “genocide” is a leading bone of contention.

A leaked draft of Pompeo’s remarks includes the bracketed phrase “hold for determination” in the part of the speech that describes what happened in Burma, Politico reported.

The U.S. has had an ambivalent relationship with Burma over the years. Along with the rest of the world, the U.S. welcomed news that the nation’s military rulers began liberalizing their rule a few years ago.

In 2016, dissident leader and Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu-Kyi was released from house arrest and led her party to victory in elections that year. The Obama administration then lifted most sanctions on the country just before it left office.

But there was a catch. The military-written Burmese constitution cements its control over the armed forces, prevents Sun-Kyi from becoming president or prime minister, and gives the generals in dark glasses enough seats in parliament to prevent changes in the constitution.

Consequently, military leaders have with the assurance they needed to drive the hated Rohingyas out of the country. So far, the U.S. has responded by only issuing economic sanctions against a single Burmese general who actively led the repression.

The debate inside the Trump administration over what to do about Burma is tied up its concern that further sanctions will push the country’s military leaders to step up ties with China and cut the country’s new economic ties to the West.

State Department legal officials still aren’t convinced that the evidence the military fully planned the systematic repression of the Rohingyas is ironclad. Such concerns are understandable, but there is a history here that compels the U.S. government to take action.

A quarter century ago, the Clinton administration had to deal with reports that hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were being massacred in that country. Clinton administration officials studiously avoided using the term “genocide” to describe what happened, because as a then-secret memo said doing so might compel the U.S. to “actually ‘do something.’”

No one is asking or expecting the United States to intervene in Burma now. But it’s important that America not avoid uncomfortable or inconvenient language in describing the atrocities in Burma for what they are – genocide.

Sam Brownback, President Trump’s ambassador-at-large for religious freedom, put it best when he said: “We have to start calling it what it is. This is religious cleansing. It would not be happening were these people not Muslim. If they were Buddhists, in all likelihood this would not be happening today.”

The outcome of the battle over the language to be used in Secretary Pompeo’s speech on Myanmar will soon be revealed. For moral, humanitarian and even legal reasons it’s important the U.S. avoid “diplospeak” and properly label what has happened to the Rohingyas as genocide.

George Orwell, the author of the novel “1984,” long ago warned of how our thought and society itself is undermined when we debase the language and employ euphemisms. On the issue of what is going on in Burma, America must speak clearly, succinctly and with no ambiguity.",world
"As migrants continue to spill over the porous southern border, many politicians are calling the situation a “crisis” and are urging the government to do more. Some have even proposed putting up a fence along one of the longest borders in the world.

The border in question, however, is not America’s border with Mexico, but Canada’s with the United States. Some estimate that as many as 400 a day are crossing the 5,525 mile border between Canada and the U.S. through non-official ports of entry and with provincial elections looming, the issue is causing political ramifications.

As the Trump Administration has cancelled Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for several nationalities with large immigrant communities in the U.S. - notably Haitians and Salvadorans - many of those people have felt they have little option but to flee to Canada for safety.

Under a refugee agreement known as the Safe Third Country Agreement that both the U.S. and Canada are party to, a person with protected status in a country that is deemed “safe” for refugees (in this case, the United States) cannot leave the country and apply for asylum in another “safe” country at an official port of entry. A loophole in the agreement, however, allows these refugees to apply for asylum in another country if they’re already inside that country.

This has led to thousands of asylum-seekers crossing into Canada from gaps in the border with the U.S. over the past two years, almost all of them into the province of Québec from upstate New York.

This situation has created political tension across Canada, with conservatives laying blame for the “crisis” squarely at the feet of Justin Trudeau’s government. Shortly after President Trump took office, the Canadian prime minister issued a now-infamous Tweet saying that all refugees would be welcome in his country, with the hashtag #WelcomeToCanada.

Many, such as the opposition Conservative Party’s shadow Minister for Immigration, Michelle Rempel, have said that this created an unrealistic expectation that anyone could come to Canada. During emergency meetings in Parliament this summer on the issue, Rempel said she doesn’t think that’s sustainable, and added that she thought the “situation is going to get worse.”

Those feelings have been echoed by leaders in the province of Ontario, who have called on the Trudeau government to do come up with a plan on how to deal with asylum-seekers, who continue to cross into the country in significant numbers. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police intercepted 7,326 people at the border between April and July.

ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS IN CANADA RISE FROM JUNE TO JULY

Nowhere has this tension over migration been felt more keenly than Québec, the only Canadian province that has partial control over who immigrates there, and the province of arrival for an estimated 96% of irregular border crossers (the Canadian government actively discourages the use of the term “illegal” to describe asylum-seekers that have entered the country by straying across the border). Many in the predominantly French-speaking province consider immigration to be a process that dilutes Québec’s unique linguistic and cultural identity in North America.

The province is facing an election on October 1st in which immigration is already proving to be a hot-button issue. The governing Liberal Party led by Premier Philippe Couillard has worked closely with the federal government to accommodate asylum seekers, allowing most of those who want to remain in the province to stay while helping those who do not get settled in Toronto and other locales that can accommodate them.

However, even the Liberal government in the province declared earlier this summer that they, along with the province of Ontario, have “run out of room”.

CANADIAN IMMIGRATION WEBSITE CRASHES DURING ELECTION

The party is trailing in opinion polls to a nationalist opposition party known as the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ), which has promised to slash even legal immigration by as much as 20%, and to force all new immigrants to learn French. Currently, most immigrants are given the option of learning either English or French. In an interview with the Montréal Gazette earlier this year, the party’s immigration spokeswoman Nathalie Roy accused the Liberal government of trying to “hide the problem [of immigration] under the carpet.”

In response, Premier Couillard accused the CAQ of considering immigrants to be “problems that need solving.”

CHICK-FIL-A'S CANADIAN EXPANSION SPARKS PRO-LGBTQ PROTESTS

The CAQ, led by former businessman François Legault, has also proposed taking strong action to protect the “secular” nature of the state, by banning overt religious symbols such as hijabs and yarmulkes.

Legault’s party has been far from the only one proposing tough solutions to immigration problems in Québec. In a move that may sound familiar to Americans, another opposition party, the Parti Québécois (PQ) proposed earlier this year to construct a fence along stretches of the province’s border with New York that have seen large numbers of asylum seekers enter the country. The PQ’s leader, Jean-François Lisée, has since walked back those comments somewhat but the idea sparked a conversation about what can be done to discourage refugees from making the journey.

Currently, as provincial politicians have begun to distance themselves from open-arms immigration policies, the staunchest champion of Canada’s surging population of asylum-seekers is still Trudeau. But polls have shown that most Canadians would prefer a stronger line, like that espoused by the opposition Conservative Party, be taken instead. With a federal election in the country scheduled for next October, Québec’s election could be a bellwether for Trudeau.",world
"A supporter of the Islamic State group who plotted to kill British Prime Minister Theresa May received a prison sentence of at least 30 years Friday from a judge who called him ""a very dangerous individual.""

Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman was convicted last month in London of planning to bomb the entry gates to the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. Prosecutors said he intended to then kill the guards there and to attack May with a knife or gun.

Rahman, 21, was arrested in November after collecting a backpack he was led to think contained explosives supplied by other IS adherents. The fellow sympathizers with whom he had communicated were actually undercover intelligence agents.

Prior to his arrest, Rahman was referred to a government de-radicalization program, but nonetheless plotted his attack over the course of two years, according to prosecutors. They said two of Rahman's uncles had been jailed in Britain for funding terrorism, while another was killed in a drone strike in Syria.

Judge Charles Haddon-Cave sentenced Rahman to life in prison with no chance of parole for 30 years.

Haddon-Cave said Rahman believed he had obtained a real bomb that was ""capable of causing casualties on a scale comparable to those caused at the Manchester Arena,"" where a suicide bomber at an Ariana Grande concert killed 22 people in 2017.

""Rahman is a very dangerous individual and it is difficult to predict when, if ever, he will become de-radicalized and no longer be a danger to society,"" the judge said.",world
"Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman has been officially dethroned as the most-wanted drug lord.

Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as ""El Mencho,"" was named the most-wanted drug kingpin in North America after Mexican Authorities and the U.S. State Department put a combined $6.5 million bounty for the leader of the Jalisco New Generation cartel.

Paul Craine, who previously headed the Drug and Enforcement Administration in Mexico when El Chapo was captured in 2016, told the New York Post that El Mencho has an “army of thousands of bad guys.”

“He’s public enemy No. 1,” Craine said.

El Mencho, 52, a former police officer in Mexico, runs the cartel that rose in the ranks following El Chapo’s arrest in 2016 and his extradition to the United States. Guzman remains in prison in New York City, where he’s awaiting his November trial on murder, money laundering and drug trafficking charges.

MEXICAN DRUG LORD 'EL CHAPO' TORTURED, KILLED 6 AMERICANS AND DEA AGENT WITHIN 9-WEEK SPAN, REPORT SAYS

Jalisco New Generation cartel has proven to be more ruthless and better organized than the Sinaloa cartel in recent years.

“Unlike the other cartels, they function like a paramilitary organization,” Craine told the New York Post. “They are like an iron hand taking control of Jalisco, and have set up carjackings and roadblocks to show their power.”

El Mencho has entrenched his cartel’s routes in the U.S., Europe and Asia. DEA Regional Director North and Central Americas Region Matthew G. Donahue said last week that the cartel is a “rapidly expanding brand” in Chicago and in the world, WLS-TV reported.

The now most-wanted drug lord had previously shown his violent side. He ordered a series of attacks in 2015 on security forces in Jalisco. He reportedly firebombed gas stations and banks and ordered cartel members to take down a military helicopter with rocket-propelled grenades, the New York Post reported.

Mexican authorities announced last week they were adding $1.5 million to the State Department’s $5 million reward offer for information leading to El Mencho’s arrest.

El Mencho’s wife, Rosalinda Gonzalez Valencia, was arrested last May. She worked as the cartel’s chief accountant.

“I have no doubt that El Mencho will be caught, but the violence won’t end until the Mexican government gets serious about strengthening the rule of law and ending corruption,” Craine said.",world
"A Sherpa who scaled Mount Everest as part of a publicity stunt that had climbers bury a new cryptocurrency at the summit of the world’s largest peak is believed to have died on the team’s descent.

Two Sherpa joined three Ukrainian climbers for a trek to the summit on May 14 carrying two Ledger crypto wallets containing about $50,000 worth of new cryptocurrency tokens launched by ASKfm, the world’s largest question-and-answer board, Rock and Ice reported.

The plan was to bury one of the wallets at the summit and dare a brave soul to trek up and retrieve the tokens.

The team got to the summit of Mount Everest safely; however, it was on the way down that it all went wrong. According to reports, the weather started to worsen before the team reached base camp.

According to ASKfm, the climb to the summit was considered a success and all the climbers were able to make it down relatively unharmed. Taris Pozdnii, one of the climbers, suffered frostbite on his fingers and feet but has recovered.

However, one of the Sherpas, who was believed to be Lam Babu Sherpa, was reportedly left behind while the climbers made their way back. He was believed to be dead.

A May 17 press release from ASKfm, published after the group returned to base camp, did not mention the Sherpa’s status.

The Financial Times reported one of the climbers stating, “At the top of Everest the weather was very bad, and then we were coming down. We were going down to Camp 4, which is at about 7900 m, and one Sherpa was dying. That’s all we know. … He was behind us, so we don’t know what happened to him. We were going fast and the Sherpa wasn’t coming with us. He was coming behind so we didn’t see him.”

"An estimated 2,975 people died in the six months after Hurricane Maria as a result of the storm, with the elderly and impoverished most affected, according to a long-awaited independent study ordered by the U.S. territory's government that was released Tuesday.

The findings contrast sharply with the official death toll of 64, and are about double the government's previous interim estimate of 1,400 deaths.

Researchers with The Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University said the official death count from the Category 4 storm that hit on Sept. 20 was low in part because physicians were not trained on how to certify deaths after a disaster.

There was a 22 percent overall increase in the number of deaths from September 2017 to February 2018 compared to previous years in the same time period, Lynn Goldman, dean of the institute, told reporters.

""We are hopeful that the government will accept this as an official death toll,"" she said.

The office of Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello did not immediately return a message for comment.

The study noted that mortality in Puerto Rico had been slowly decreasing since 2010, but spiked after the hurricane. About 40 percent of Puerto Rico's 78 municipalities saw a significantly higher number of deaths in the six months after the storm compared with the previous two years, researchers said. These municipalities were located mostly in the island's northeast and southwest regions.

Researchers found that the risk of death was 45 percent higher for those living in impoverished communities, and that men older than 65 saw a continuous elevated risk of death.

They also stated that physicians and others told them that Puerto Rico's government did not notify them about federal guidelines on how to document deaths related to a major disaster.

""Others expressed reluctance to relate deaths to hurricanes due to concern about the subjectivity of this determination and about liability,"" the report stated.

Researchers said they took into account an 8 percent drop in Puerto Rico's population that occurred from September 2017 to mid-February 2018, when tens of thousands fled the damage left by the storm.",world

More than 1,000 people were detained at anti-government protests across the country in what the Kremlin on Monday called a legitimate response to unauthorized rallies.

The OVD-Info group, which tracks police detentions and posts the names of the detainees on its website, said that 1,018 people were detained during Sunday's demonstrations against a government plan to increase the ages at which Russians collect their state pension.

Nearly half of those detained were rounded up in St. Petersburg, according to the OVD-Info. Russia's second-largest city arguably saw the most robust response with riot police charging at protesters with batons. Minors and elderly people were among those arrested.

President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the police acted in accordance with the law in response to unauthorized protests. He added that ""hooligans and provocateurs"" mixed up with protesters and assailed police.

In Moscow, authorities charged two men with assailing police.

On Monday, several activists tried to launch another protest in a tree-lined boulevard in central Moscow but they were quickly rounded up by police.

Sunday's rallies, which had been called by opposition leader Alexei Navalny, were held in dozens of towns and cities across Russia.

Navalny, the anti-corruption activist who is Putin's most visible foe, had called for protests against the government's pension proposal before he was sentenced to 30 days in jail for organizing an unsanctioned January protest over a different issue.

The government's plan calls for the eligibility age for retirement pensions to be raised by five years, to 65 for men and 60 for women.

It has irked both older Russians, who fear they won't live long enough to collect significant benefits, and younger generations worried that keeping people in the workforce longer will limit their own employment opportunities.

The government's proposal has dented Putin's popularity. The president responded by offering some concessions, but argued that the age hike is necessary because rising life expectancy in Russia could exhaust pension resources if the eligibility age remains the same.",world
"The Vietnamese man who ran the infamous “Hanoi Hilton” prison, where the late Sen. John McCain was held as a prisoner of war for more than five years, paid respect to the former U.S. Navy pilot who later was instrumental in bringing the wartime foes together.

“At that time I liked him personally for his toughness and strong stance,” former Col. Tran Trong Duyet, told Vietnam News on Sunday. “When I learnt about his death (Sunday), I feel very sad. I would like to send condolences to his family. I think it’s the same feeling for all Vietnamese people as he has greatly contributed to the development of Vietnam-U.S. relations.”

McCain, who was taken prisoner after his Skyhawk dive bomber was shot down over Hanoi in 1967, died of brain cancer on Saturday at age 81 in his home state of Arizona.

Duyet, who said he was “very fond” of McCain during his service as a U.S. senator, was among the scores of people in the former communist country paying respects to McCain.

At the monument by Truc Bach lake, where McCain landed after parachuting from his damaged plane, dozens paid their respects, leaving flowers and tokens.

Robert Gibb, an American living in Hanoi, visited the monument in the Vietnamese capital, telling the Daily Sabah that he felt “compelled to come out here and bring some flowers.”

“He was the last guy I ever voted for president,” he added. “The moment he dropped in here change by life forever.”

The country’s foreign minister said McCain was a “symbol of his generation” who helped “heal the wounds of war.”

Pham Binh Minh wrote in a condolence book at the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi: “For both the government of Vietnam and its people, Senator McCain was a symbol of his generation of senators, and of the veterans of the Vietnam War. It was he who took the lead in significantly healing the wounds of war, and normalizing and promoting the comprehensive Vietnam-U.S. partnership.”

Speaking to reporters after writing in a book of condolences, U.S. Ambassador Daniel Kritenbrink said McCain was ""a great leader and real hero"" who helped normalize relations between the former enemies.

""He was a warrior, he was also a peacemaker and of course he fought and suffered during the Vietnam War, but then later as a senator, he was one of the leaders who helped bring our countries back together and helped the United States and Vietnam normalize our relationship and now become partners and friends,"" Kritenbrink said.

McCain and then-Sen. John Kerry played important roles in the normalization of bilateral relations in 1995.

Pham Gia Minh, a 62-year-old businessman who signed the condolence book at the embassy, said he witnessed Vietnamese civilians being killed by the U.S. bombings of North Vietnam, including the Christmas bombing of Hanoi in 1972, but he admired McCain for overcoming the difficult past to build better ties between the two countries.

""War is losses and suffering,"" he told the AP. ""But the will of a brave nation is to go beyond that to look to the future. The Vietnamese people have that will and Mr. John McCain has that will. ... We both have that will to overcome the painful past, overcome the misunderstanding to together build a brighter future.""

Hoang Thi Hang, a Hanoi resident who also signed the condolence book, said he had great respect for McCain's compassion. ""He had compassion for everyone, whether they were rich or poor, whatever their background. And that is important in life.""

The U.S. Embassy announced it will launch a McCain/Kerry Fellowship in which a young Vietnamese leader committed to public service will be chosen each year to travel to the U.S. on a study tour to deepen ties between the two peoples.

McCain will be buried on a grassy hill at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, right next longtime friend Chuck Larson, himself an admiral and ally throughout McCain’s remarkable life.

The suspect allegedly stabbed two American tourists on Friday before police shot and wounded him. He holds a German residency permit and was identified as Jawed S. in line with Dutch privacy rules.

The Americans are recovering in a hospital. Their identities have not been released. The suspect also is hospitalized.

Amsterdam City Hall says German authorities searched the suspect's home and seized data storage devices that would be analyzed as part of the investigation.

"President Donald Trump's national security adviser said Wednesday there was no timetable for releasing the administration's much-anticipated Mideast peace plan.

John Bolton said a ""lot of progress"" has been made, but he refused to say what the plan entailed or when it may be publicized. The Trump administration recently began staffing its Mideast policy team ahead of the plan's expected release.

Trump officials have long promised the most comprehensive package ever put forward toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians have indicated they consider it a non-starter given Trump's bias toward Israel and his unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as its capital.

At a West Virginia rally on Tuesday, Trump said Israel will pay a ""price"" for that move and the Palestinians will ""get something very good"" in return.

Bolton would not address the Trump comments or say what the Palestinians could expect.

""Work continues,"" he said at a press conference in Jerusalem. ""There are a lot of consultations and there is no decision on a timetable for when the full details of the plan will be announced.""

Bolton said the Palestinians have ""been used as agents by radical leaders over the years for their own political purposes"" and that when the plan was rolled out they would discover that the Trump administration wants to give them a chance for a decent life.

Most of Bolton's three-day visit to Israel, however, was focused on Iran.

Bolton has been a strident critic of the nuclear deal signed between world powers and Iran, which the United States backed out of earlier this year. He has pushed for greater pressure on Tehran to get it to halt its support for regional militant groups and its development of ballistic missiles.

Israel was also deeply opposed to the nuclear accord, which lifted international sanctions on Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear program.

Bolton lauded recent anti-government protests in Iran but insisted ""regime change in Iran is not American policy.""

He reiterated that he hoped to work with Russia on getting Iran's forces out of Syria and issued a stern warning to President Bashar Assad's government ahead of an expected assault on the rebel-held Idlib province.

""We are obviously concerned about the possibility that Assad may use chemical weapons again,"" he said. ""Just so there's no confusion here: if the Syrian regime uses chemical weapons we will respond very strongly and they really ought to think about this a long time before they come into any decision, because there is no ambiguity in the U.S. position on this point.""

"Convicted leaker Chelsea Manning will be barred from entering Australia for a scheduled speaking tour set to start Sunday, her event organizer said Thursday.

The Australian government sent Manning’s team a notice of intention to deny the U.S. whistleblower’s entry, said Think Inc. who is organizing the event. The organizers said they gave the government more than 10 letters of support from individuals and organizers who support Manning’s visit to Australia.

""Ms. Manning offers formidable ideas and an insightful perspective which we are hoping to bring to the forefront of Australian dialogue,"" Think Inc. Director Suzi Jamil said in a statement.

All non-citizens visiting Australia must fall under the character requirements put out by the Migration Act. Anyone can be denied if they fail the character test.

Think Inc. is calling on her supporters to lobby new Immigration Minister David Coleman to allow her into the country, where she’s scheduled to speak at the Sydney Opera House and at two other events. While she can appeal, past precedent suggests the decision has already been made.

This isn’t the first time Manning was denied entry to a country. Last year, she was barred from entering Canada, but was later allowed to appear at another event, Reuters reported.

After her trip to Australia, Manning is expected to travel to neighboring New Zealand. Immigration officials in New Zealand are expected to make a decision by Friday on whether to grant her a ""special direction"" visa.

She doesn't qualify for entry otherwise because she has a criminal conviction within the last 10 years for which she had a sentence exceeding 1 year, according to the country's visa rules.

Thousands of Indians gathered Friday as the funeral pyre was lit for former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a Hindu nationalist who was respected across the political spectrum.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the mourners who walked under a hot sun behind a flower-decked gun carriage carrying Vajpayee's body to a cremation ground on the banks of the Yamuna river.

Vajpayee, both a poet and a politician, died Thursday at age 93 in a New Delhi hospital.

His foster daughter lit the funeral pyre in a riverside enclave of memorials where the country's other former prime ministers have also been cremated.

Top Indian politicians, including Rahul Gandhi of the opposition Congress party, and South Asian leaders including Bhutanese King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, and Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali, also attended the cremation.

Pakistan arranged a special flight so a four-member delegation led by Information Minister Ali Zafar could attend.

Earlier Friday, supporters chanting ""Long Live Vajpayee!"" escorted his body from his home to the Bharatiya Janata Party headquarters where admirers came to pay their last respects.

In many ways Vajpayee was a complicated figure, a leader of the moderate wing of India's often-strident Hindu nationalist movement and a lifelong poet who oversaw India's growth into a strutting regional economic power. He ordered nuclear tests in 1998 that raised fears of atomic war with Pakistan, but also, a few years later, reached across the border and made the first moves toward peace with Islamabad.

The government has declared a seven-day mourning period for him. Schools were closed Friday in the Indian capital.

The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, sent a condolence message to Vajpayee's foster daughter, Namita Bhattacharya, saying India had lost an eminent national leader who had eloquently supported the Tibetan people.

Vajpayee served three times as India's prime minister; for 13 days in 1996, for 13 months from 1998 to 1999, and then from 1999 to 2004.",world

Aleksandar Vucic planned to visit a Serb-populated village in central Kosovo on Sunday, but the roads leading to the region were blocked by wooden logs, trucks and heavy machinery.

Serbian media said gunfire could also be heard, but those reports couldn't be independently verified. Vucic wasn't under attack.

Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic blamed the blockades on former Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers who fought Serb troops in Kosovo during the 1998-99 war for independence.

The conflict ended with a NATO intervention that forced Serbia to pull out of Kosovo. Kosovo unilaterally declared independence in 2008 which Serbia doesn't recognize.",world
"The death toll from fighting between rival armed groups in Libya's capital Tripoli has climbed to at least 50 people including civilians, authorities said Tuesday, as the U.N. mission stepped up efforts to broker a cease-fire.

Fighting erupted last week when the Seventh Brigade, militias which hail from Tarhouna, a town about 40 miles (60 kilometers) south of Tripoli, attacked southern neighborhoods of the capital. The Tripoli Revolutionaries' Brigades and the Nawasi Brigade — militias which support the Tripoli-based U.N.-backed government — have come to the city's defense.

At least 138 people, including civilians, have since been wounded, the Health Ministry said in a statement.

Libya slid into chaos after the 2011 uprising that overthrew ruler Moammar Gadhafi and led to his death. The country is currently governed by rival authorities in Tripoli and the country's east, each of which are backed by an array of militias. Other armed groups have carved out fiefdoms across the country, with many profiting from smuggling and extortion.

The U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva has voiced concern about the impact of the fighting on migrants and internally displaced people. Spokeswoman Liz Throssell said Tuesday that some of the nearly 8,000 arbitrarily detained migrants are trapped in detention centers in areas where fighting has taken place, without access to food or medical treatment.

She said at least 21 civilians have been killed, including two women and two children since Aug. 26.

Also on Tuesday, the U.N. Refugee Agency called on parties to the fighting to ""spare civilians and civilian infrastructure and allow safe passage for those seeking refuge in safer areas.""

The clashes have forced the U.N.-backed government to declare a state of emergency in and around Tripoli, saying the fighting is ""an attempt to derail peaceful political transition"" in the country. The government said it ""could not remain silent over the attacks on Tripoli and its suburbs, which is a violation of security in the capital and of citizens' safety.""

Mohamed Buisier, a political analyst, said the fighting was expected as the armed groups protecting the government in Tripoli were getting ""larger portions of financial incentives.""

""This is a normal thing after years of failure. ... We are in a new phase where nobody can strip the militias from their arms. Libya needs an international peace-keeping force,"" he said.

The U.N. mission in Libya has been preparing for a meeting between the warring parties in an effort to put an end to the fighting. It called on ""the various concerned parties"" to meet on Tuesday for an ""urgent dialogue on the security situation"" in Tripoli.

People smugglers are taking greater risks to ferry their human cargo toward Europe as Libya's coast guard intercepts more and more boats carrying migrants, increasing the likelihood that those on board may die during the Mediterranean journeys, the U.N. refugee agency said Monday.

That's one of the key findings from a new UNHCR report about efforts to reach Europe. The report, titled ""Desperate Journeys,"" said that even though the number of crossings and deaths has plunged compared to recent years, the voyage is more deadly in percentage terms for those who venture across.

It said that 2,276 people died last year while trying to cross, or one death for every 42 arrivals.

This year, it's 1,095 deaths, or one out of every 18 arrivals. In June alone, the proportion hit one death for every seven arrivals.

On the Central Mediterranean route so far this year, there have been 10 separate incidents in which 50 or more people died — most after departing from Libya. Seven of those incidents have been since June alone, UNHCR said.

""The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risk, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coast guards,"" said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's special envoy for the central Mediterranean. ""They are trying to cut the costs: It costs them more to keep those people here longer in their warehouses, under captivity.""

Libyan authorities intercepted or rescued 18,400 people between August last year and July this year — a 38-percent increase from the same period of 2016 and 2017. Arrivals by sea from Libya to Europe plummeted 82 percent in those comparable periods, to 30,800 in the more recent one.

UNHCR says a growing worry these days is deaths on land by people trying to get to Libya in the first place, or getting stuck in squalid, overcrowded detention centers: Many get returned there after failing to cross by sea to Europe.

""The problems after disembarkation (is that) those people are sent back to detention centers, and many disappear,"" Cochetel said. ""Many are sold to militias, and to traffickers, and people employing them without paying them.""

He said the drop in departures means that traffickers attempt to ""monetize their investment, which means they have to exploit more people. That results in more cases of slavery, forced labor, prostitution of those people — because they (smugglers) want to make money on those people.""

Would-be workers and migrants are still pouring into Libya: Some are fleeing injustice, abuse or autocrats in their home countries further south in Africa. Others are looking for work in the oil industry or agriculture.

""I think you have more deaths on land,"" Cochetel said, referring to treks across the desert in Sudan, Algeria, Chad and Niger. ""Many people in Libya are reporting having seeing people dead in the desert on the way to Libya.""

In Libya, instability continues even seven years after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi. French medical aid group Doctors Without Borders said Friday that fighting between rival militias in Tripoli, the capital, has endangered the lives of people trapped there and worsened humanitarian needs — especially at migrant detention centers.

Cochetel said Europe — where some countries have shown ""appalling"" squabbles about who would take in rescue ships carrying migrants — should look at the root causes of such journeys. European populations need to shun anti-migrant rhetoric and realize that figures are down sharply, and migrant flows are clearly manageable at current levels, he said.

""Europe has to show the lead, has to be exemplary in its response, but it's quite clear that it's already too late when the people are in Libya,"" he said. ""We need to work downstream in country of first asylum, in country of origin, and that takes time.""",world
"Iranian Christians are in dire straits in the Islamic Republic because of a new wave of regime repression that has largely not registered in the media due to the country’s economic free fall and popular uprising by a people fed up with the tyrannical nature of the regime.

The mullahs have launched a cut-throat campaign to silence their opponents, and on top of their list are Iran’s persecuted Christians – an ancient people of the land the regime stigmatizes as a gateway to the West.

On August 9, an organization – Article 18 – that promotes religious freedom in Iran, reported that a court in Boushehr had sentenced a couple of Christian converts and ten other Iranians to one year in prison each for “propagating against the Islamic Republic in favor of Christianity.”

The sentence came just weeks after Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani – often portrayed in the West as a reform-minded moderate – had vowed that “Christians have the same rights as others do.”

Christianity, of course, is not alien to Iran where it arrived in Persia not long after the death of Christ. There are believed to be an estimated 350,000 Christians in Iran, with a growing trend toward converting to Christianity. Iran’s Statistical Center reports 117,700 Christians in a country of just over 82 million people.

The real number of Iranian Christians probably exceeds 350,000 because of the anti-Christian conditions they face in the country. Turning inward not to expose oneself to the dangers of practicing Christianity has become a survival strategy in Iran.

The law heavily discriminates against non-Muslims, who have been barred from all influential positions in central state organs since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Blasphemy and apostasy remain capital offences.

The persecution of Iran’s Christians is well-documented and is not limited to Evangelicals. Last year, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), arrested two Christians – a mother and her son – as part of a vicious crackdown on Catholicism in the country’s West Azerbaijan Province.

The U.S. administration of President Donald Trump designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization in October 2017. The 125,000-member-strong IRGC has a long record of brutality targeting Christians and democracy movements opposed to the mullah regime.

Europe, so far, has declined to sanction the IRGC for their blatant human rights violations.

The evidence is hard to ignore. Iranian authorities regularly arrest worshippers, raid house churches, and confiscate Bibles, Christian CDs and other religious literature, while regime-controlled media outlets spread anti-Christian propaganda.

A 2018 report by the Commission for International Religious Freedom observed that, “In the past year, religious freedom in Iran continued to deteriorate for both recognized and unrecognized religious groups, with the government targeting Baha’is and Christian converts in particular.”

Four evangelical Christians were arrested in May 2017 and sentenced each to 10 years in prison for house church activities and evangelism.

Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani stood trial in July along three co-defendants because of their house church activities. They were all sentenced to 10 years in prison. It is worth recalling that Nadarkhani was previously sentenced in 2010 to death for his conversion to Christianity. After a global pressure campaign ensued, Iran’s regime released him from prison, after a three-year incarceration. Over 70,000 people signed a petition urging Iran’s judiciary to release Nadarkhani.

In June 2017, an Iranian court sentenced Pentecostal Assyrian Church Pastor Victor Bet Tamraz and three other members of his community to 10 or 15 years each in prison because of their faith.

Iran has a choice to make. As a signatory of international human rights declarations, the Islamic Republic must adhere to basic humanitarian law – including freedom of religion and belief – or is rightly castigated as a pariah in the family of nations.

The U.S. imposed economic sanctions on Iran’s precious metal trade, automobile sector and use of U.S. currency in August. A powerful second round of U.S. economic penalties will hit Iran’s oil and financial sectors in November.

To isolate Iran’s clerical leaders – and hold those accountable for grave human rights violations – the EU and U.S. should impose a potent round of human rights sanctions on regime officials persecuting Iranian Christians.

The Islamic Republic remains highly vulnerable when a spotlight is shined on their widespread repression of religious freedom. If past is prologue, new human rights sanctions and global pressure can save the lives of persecuted Iranian Christians.

"When President Trump announced his plan to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accords in June 2017, the howling cries from left-wing environmentalists could be heard across the globe.

From Canada to China and throughout Europe, the world denounced the president’s decision as reckless and in contradiction to “settled science.” Without the Paris Climate Accords, they argued, Earth would soon find itself cascading off the global warming cliff.

One year later, Earth is still here, as you may have noticed.

And the U.S. economy – due in large part to the Trump administration’s commitment to deregulation and energy dominance – has continued to grow at breakneck speed. On Friday the federal government announced our nation’s gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter of this year – the highest growth rate in four years.

On top of this good news, despite the warnings of gloom and doom from President Trump’s opponents, America is now the world leader in cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Yes, you read that right.

According to a June report by BP – measuring global carbon dioxide emissions from the use of oil, gas and coal – the United States reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by 41.8 million tons from 2016 to 2017, marking the third consecutive year Americans’ carbon dioxide emissions fell.

The United States’ carbon dioxide reduction is more than double the next closest nation included in the study, Ukraine. And the U.S. reductions are part of a larger, decade-long trend. From 2006 to 2016, BP reports the United States slashed its carbon dioxide emissions by about 12 percent.

The recent drop in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions is the result of increased consumption of natural gas relative to other forms of energy production, renewable energy and a more efficient use of electricity.

In the wake of America’s declining carbon dioxide emissions, the dire warnings issued by global warming alarmists have proven to be yet another example of environmentalists’ fear-mongering.

One of those alarmists was Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who called President Trump’s decision to exit the Paris Accords a “devastating failure of historic proportions.”

After world leaders from countries big and small also harshly criticized President Trump for choosing not to make Americans beholden to the United Nations, the leaders spent the rest of 2017 presiding over countries that emitted millions of tons of additional carbon dioxide – illustrating clearly the utter worthlessness of the Paris Accords.

China, for example, increased its carbon dioxide emissions by 119 million tons from 2016 to 2017 – more than any other country in the world – despite its alleged commitment to the Paris Accords. Spain added more than 18.7 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. France’s carbon dioxide emissions increased by 5.5 million tons.

But it’s the Canadian government that might deserve the award for being the world’s biggest carbon dioxide hypocrite. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was critical of the Trump administration for its decision to leave the Paris Accords, saying in a statement that he was “deeply disappointed” by the “disheartening” decision.

“Canada is unwavering in our commitment to fight climate change and support clean economic growth,” Trudeau said. “Canadians know we need to take decisive and collective action to tackle the many harsh realities of our changing climate.”

So, after those bold words Canada cut its carbon dioxide emissions dramatically, right? Well, not exactly. In 2017 Canada emitted 17 million additional tons of carbon dioxide compared to its emissions in 2016.

Perhaps the reason Canada, China, France, Spain and dozens of other Paris signatories added carbon dioxide emissions – while at the same time chastising America for working toward energy independence – is because the leaders of those countries know what skeptics of global warming alarmism have known for decades: The world is much better off with affordable energy than it is trying to combat a problem many scientists say doesn’t exist.

Of course, Prime Minister Trudeau and the rest of the Paris cabal will never publicly admit it. It’s much easier to spend time in office boasting of their own virtue and lamenting the tragic individualism of the American way.

Forensic investigators and researchers awaited access Tuesday to the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, gutted in a fire, to find out how the blaze began and what remains of the 20 million artifacts that made the museum one of the most important in Latin America.

After a fire tore through the museum Sunday, engineers were doing tests on the structure to make sure it wouldn't collapse. Authorities had expressed concern Monday that internal walls and parts of the roof were weak.

The museum held Latin America's largest collection of historical and scientific artifacts, and officials suggested that the damage could be catastrophic, with one official telling a Brazilian news outlet that as much as 90 percent may have been destroyed.

The cause of the fire was not known. Federal police will investigate since the museum was part of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. But protesters, commentators and museum directors themselves said years of government neglect had left the museum so underfunded that its staff had turn to crowdfunding sites to open exhibitions. In another example of struggling public services, firefighters initially struggled to contain it because the hydrants closest to the museum did not work. Instead, trucks had to gather water from a nearby lake.

Roberto Leher, rector of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said it was well known that the building was vulnerable to fire and in need of extensive repairs. In fact, the institution had recently secured approval for nearly $5 million for a planned renovation, including an upgrade of the fire-prevention system, but the money had not yet been disbursed.

On Monday, officials promised $2.4 million to shore up the building and promised to rebuild the museum.

""Those saying that the museum will be rebuilt are not telling the truth,"" said Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Braganca, an heir to Brazil's last emperor. ""The building could be rebuilt, but the collection will never again be rebuilt. Two hundred years, workers, researchers, professors that dedicated in body and soul (to the museum) ... the work of their life burned due to the negligence of the Brazilian state.""

The museum, whose main building was once home to the royal family, had extensive paleontological, anthropological and biological specimens. It also contained a skull called Luzia that was among the oldest fossils ever found in the Americas. It held an Egyptian mummy and the largest meteorite ever discovered in Brazil — one of the few objects that officials could confirm had survived. Some parts of the collection were held at others sites and thus spared.

Luiz Fernando Dias Duarte, the museum's deputy director, said that anything held in the main building was likely destroyed, and Cristiana Serejo, a vice-director of the museum, told the G1 news portal that maybe around 10 percent of the collection had survived.

For many in Brazil, the state of the 200-year-old natural history museum quickly became a metaphor for what they see as the gutting of Brazilian culture and life during years of corruption, economic collapse and poor governance.

Brazil has struggled to emerge from a two-year recession and seen its political and corporate elite jailed in Latin America's largest corruption investigation. The country has been riven with deep political divisions following the impeachment and removal of former President Dilma Rousseff.

"Russia on Tuesday again accused Syrian rebels of preparing a chemical attack which Moscow says will be used to justify a Western strike against Syrian troops.

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Tuesday that the al-Qaida-linked Levant Liberation Committee is preparing the attack in the northern Idlib province, and that it would be filmed by first-responders known as the White Helmets, who Russia has accused of fabricating past attacks.

Western countries and independent analysts say Syrian government forces have conducted several chemical weapons attacks over the course of the seven-year civil war. Alleged chemical attacks in 2017 and earlier this year led the U.S. to launch punitive strikes against Syrian forces.

Russia is a close ally of the Syrian government, which denies ever using chemical weapons. The Syrian government has been sending reinforcements toward Idlib for weeks ahead of an expected major offensive against the last major rebel stronghold in the country.

Last week, Russian Maj. Gen. Alexei Tsygankov, who heads the center for reconciliation of warring parties in Syria, claimed that British special services were involved in plans for the alleged provocation. That brought a heated denial from Britain's U.N. ambassador, Karen Pierce, during a Security Council session on the humanitarian situation in Syria held Tuesday.

""Even by the egregious standards of Russian propaganda, this is an extraordinary allegation,"" she said. ""It is wholly untrue.""

She said the claim was either aimed at increasing ""the amount of fake news in the system (or) as a smoke screen for a possible impending attack by the Syrian regime, once again against its own people, in Idlib.""

""I repeat the statement that I, the French and the Americans made earlier about responding appropriately,"" she added.

U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton last week warned Syria's government against using chemical weapons and vowed a tough response if it does.

Russia's U.N. ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said that ""if the Defense Ministry says something, then it says that based on concrete facts.""

""The Syrian armed forces do not have chemical weapons and have no plans to use them. There is no military need for that. We have stated that more than once. People in their right minds will not use means that are useless from a military point of view in order to trigger reprisals by three major powers,"" he said.",world

Investigators working for the U.N.'s top human rights body said Monday that top Myanmar military leaders should be prosecuted for genocide against Rohingya Muslims.

The call, accompanying a first report by the investigators, amounts to some of the strongest language yet from U.N. officials who have denounced alleged human rights violations in Myanmar since a bloody crackdown began last August.

The three-member ""fact-finding mission"" working under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council meticulously assembled hundreds of accounts by expatriate Rohingya, satellite footage and other information to assemble the report.

The U.N.-backed Human Rights Council created the mission six months before a rebel attack on security posts set off the crackdown that drove hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh.

Through hundreds of interviews with expatriate Rohingya and use of satellite footage, the team compiled accounts of crimes including gang rape, the torching of hundreds of villages, enslavement, and killings of children — some before their eyes of their own parents. The team was not granted access to Myanmar and has decried a lack of cooperation or even response from the government, which received an early copy of the report.

The team cited a ""conservative"" estimate that some 10,000 people were killed in the violence, but outside investigators have had no access to the affected regions — making a precise accounting elusive, if not impossible.

Above all, the investigators said the situation in Myanmar should be referred to the International Criminal Court, and if not, to a special tribunal. Last week, Myanmar's government rejected any cooperation with the ICC, to which it is not a party. China, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council with veto power over whether the issue will be brought before the ICC, has been reticent about condemning Myanmar's government during the crisis.

U.N. officials and human rights watchers have for months pointed to evidence of genocide in Myanmar, and the United States late last year said that ""ethnic cleansing"" was occurring in Myanmar. But few experts have studied the issue as in-depth and in such an official way as the fact-finding team, with a mandate from a body that has Myanmar's approval: The country is among the 47 members of the Human Rights Council.

The United Nations does not apply the word ""genocide"" lightly. The fact-finding team's assessment suggests the crimes against the Rohingya could meet the strict legal definition — which was last met over crimes in Bosnia and Rwanda nearly a quarter-century ago.

Human rights watchers say determining ""genocidal intent"" is perhaps the most difficult criteria to meet: In essence, it's the task of assessing the mindsets of perpetrators to determine if ethnicity, race, religion or another attribute had motivated them.

""The crimes in Rakhine state, and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,"" the report said, alluding to a region of Myanmar that is home for many Rohingya.

Adding into their assessment: The extreme brutality of the crimes; ""hate rhetoric"" and specific speech by perpetrators and military commanders; policies of exclusion against Rohingya people; an ""oppressive context;"" and the ""level of organization indicating a plan for destruction.""

The investigators cited six Myanmar military leaders by name as ""priority subjects"" for possible prosecution, led by the commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing. A longer list of names is to be kept in the office of the U.N. human rights chief for possible use in future judicial proceedings. The United States and European Union have already slapped sanctions on some Myanmar military leaders, though Min Aung Hlaing is not among them.

The authors called for the creation of a special body, or ""mechanism,"" to keep watch on the still-evolving human rights situation in Myanmar. They said the United Nations' own role in the country since 2011 should be reviewed to see if the world body did all it could to prevent such a crisis. They also faulted Aung San Suu Kyi for not using her role as head of Myanmar's government, nor her ""moral authority"" — she is a Nobel peace prize laureate — to stop the events in embattled Rakhine state.",world
"The Vatican's retired ambassador to the United States has purportedly penned an 11-page letter accusing senior Vatican officials of knowing as early as 2000 that the disgraced former archbishop of Washington, ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, regularly invited seminarians into his bed but they still promoted him to cardinal.

The letter, an extraordinary j'accuse from a one-time Holy See diplomat, also accuses Pope Francis of having initially rehabilitated McCarrick despite being informed of his penchant for young seminarians in 2013, soon after he was elected pope.

The National Catholic Register and another conservative site, LifeSiteNews, published the letter attributed to Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano on Sunday as the pope was wrapping up a two-day visit to Ireland.

Vigano, 77, a conservative whose hard-line anti-gay views are well known, also urged the reformist pope to resign over the issue.

The Vatican didn't immediately comment or confirm the letter's authenticity.

In the letter, Vigano accused the former Vatican secretaries of state under the previous two popes of having ignored detailed denunciations against McCarrick for years. He said Pope Benedict XVI eventually sanctioned McCarrick in 2009 or 2010 to a lifetime of penance and prayer, but that Francis subsequently rehabilitated him.

Francis accepted McCarrick's resignation as cardinal last month, after a U.S. church investigation determined that an accusation he had sexually abused a minor was credible.

Since then, another man has come forward saying McCarrick began molesting him starting when he was 11, and several former seminarians have said McCarrick abused and harassed them when they were in seminary. The accusations have led to a crisis in confidence in the U.S. hierarchy, because it was apparently an open secret that McCarrick regularly invited seminarians to his New Jersey beach house, and into his bed.

Coupled with the devastating allegations of sex abuse and cover-up in a recent Pennsylvania grand jury report — which found that 300 priests had abused more than 1,000 children over 70 years in six dioceses — the scandal has led to calls for heads to roll and for a full Vatican investigation into who knew what and when about McCarrick's misdeeds.

Vigano apparently sought to answer some of those questions with his lengthy note.

In it, he identifies by name the Vatican cardinals and archbishops who were informed about the McCarrick affair, an unthinkable expose for a Vatican diplomat to make. He said there are documents backing up his version of events in Vatican archives.

Vigano, the Vatican's ambassador to the U.S. from 2011-2016, said his two immediate predecessors ""did not fail"" to inform the Holy See about accusations against McCarrick, starting in 2000.

He said Francis asked him about McCarrick when they met on June 23, 2013, at the Vatican's Santa Marta hotel where the pope lives, three months after Francis was elected pope.

Vigano wrote that he told Francis: ""Holy Father, I don't know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation of Bishops, there is a dossier this thick about him. He corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.""

Vigano wrote he was surprised to find that McCarrick started travelling on missions on behalf of the church soon thereafter, including to China. McCarrick was known to have been one of the Vatican's intermediaries in the U.S.-Cuba talks in 2014.

The letter also contains a lengthy diatribe about homosexuals in the Catholic church. It often reads like an ideological manifesto, naming all of Francis' known supporters in the U.S. hierarchy as being complicit in a cover-up of McCarrick's misdeeds.",world
"A top Chinese leader has called for ""advancing anti-separatism efforts"" in Tibet, in a sign of continued high-pressure tactics in the Himalayan region.

Wang Yang, the ruling Communist Party's No. 4 ranking official, was quoted Monday in state media as stressing the importance of tight control over Tibet's Buddhist institutions, urging ""preparedness and precautions for danger in times of safety.""

Religious figures must ""be courageous to battle all separatist elements"" in the name of preserving national unity and social stability, Wang was quoted as saying in Tibet's regional capital of Lhasa during a visit there on Sunday.

Beijing's forces occupied Tibet shortly after the 1949 communist revolution and security there has been ratcheted up significantly in the decade since anti-government protests spread through Tibetan areas in 2008.

The tactics in Tibet are largely aimed at reducing the influence of the region's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India. China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for more than seven centuries and regards the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist.

Many Tibetans insist they were essentially independent for much of that time.

Wang has broad responsibility for religious policy as head of the government's top political advisory body. In his comments Sunday, he also echoed Beijing's calls for the sinicization of religion, shorthand for adherence to the dictates of the officially atheist party.

Among recent tightening security measures in Tibet, students were required to sign agreements to ""not take part in any form of religious activity"" during the summer school holidays.

Young Tibetan monks have also reportedly been forced to leave one of the biggest monasteries in a Tibetan region of western China as part of a drive to replace monastic life with secular education.

Recent months have also seen sweeping crackdowns on traditional Muslim culture among the Uighur ethnic minority group in the northwestern region of Xinjiang and among Christians in eastern China.",world

At least 11 suspects and one soldier died during shootouts with military personnel and police in greater Rio de Janeiro on Monday as violence erupted in several areas of the city that hosted the Summer Olympics two years ago.

The direct confrontations between soldiers and armed traffickers also marked a deepening of the military's role in Rio's security. Since the military was put in charge of the state's security earlier this year, soldiers have mostly played supporting roles to police during operations, such as securing perimeters or setting up checkpoints. On Monday, soldiers were clearly in the lead.

""Our goal is only to make arrests. If there are deaths, the criminals are to blame,"" Carlos Cinelli, a military spokesman, told reporters while adding that military personnel came under fire during operations that began at 4:30 a.m. ""The soldiers have a right to defend themselves.""

Cinelli told reporters that five suspects were killed and another 10 were arrested when soldiers stormed the neighborhoods of Mare, Complexo do Alemao and Penha. In a press note later in the afternoon, the military command said one soldier died and another was injured in the operations.

Cinelli said the operations, which included more than 4,000 military personnel, were aimed at finding wanted traffickers in the areas. The operation netted four pistols, two grenades and 440 pounds (200 kilograms) of marijuana paste, he said.

Brazilian news site G1 reported that many residents in the areas stayed at home, skipping work and school. An Associated Press video journalist saw a public bus that had been torched close to Complexo do Alemao, possibly a response to the anti-drug operation.

Meanwhile Monday, police said they killed six suspects during confrontations in Niteroi, across the bay from Rio de Janeiro. Police said the shootouts happened while pursuing suspects on one of the access points to the bridge that joins the two cities. The bridge, one of the area's most traversed roads, was temporarily shut. Three suspects and one police officer were injured, according to a police statement.

By decree, in February President Michel Temer put the military in charge of security in the state of Rio. He made the decision after muggings and beatings were captured on camera during Rio's world-famous Carnival celebrations.

Human rights groups have criticized the intervention, saying it's disproportionately impacting people, particularly blacks, in poor neighborhoods.

"President Trump did the right thing Thursday when he canceled his planned June 12 summit in Singapore with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and pledged to continue a “maximum pressure campaign” against the nuclear-armed communist dictatorship.

Kim really gave President Trump no choice, after North Korean propaganda outlets once again made veiled references to a potential nuclear clash with the U.S. After that, President Trump would have looked weak and foolish to meet with the dictator – with a summit essentially legitimizing Kim.

As President Trump wrote diplomatically in his letter to Kim canceling the meeting: “Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting.”

And President Trump also used his letter to remind Kim of an obvious truth: “You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.”

Canceling the summit is far better than having the summit end with nothing accomplished.

If President Trump had flown to Singapore looking like he was begging Kim for an audience and then walked away without a concrete denuclearization pledge from the dictator, the United States would have been humiliated. Tensions between the U.S. and North Korea would have surely intensified – raising the chances of a military confrontation.

Going back to January, when Kim gave his annual New Year’s Day address and declared his nation was ready to join the Olympics in South Korea, many of us thought he might be turning over a new leaf.

The world filled with hope that there could be a possible opening with Pyongyang, and that there could be a way out of a potential armed conflict that would be fought with nuclear weapons – and result in millions of people being killed.

As the months went by, we did what all humans do – we let our hopes override common sense. We allowed our dreams, aspirations and optimism to take root. The reality of who we were trying to bargain with failed to set in.

We forgot two basic truths: North Korea will always be North Korea, and Kim Jong Un is a brutal, lying dictator who can’t be trusted.

Until Kim has his “come to Jesus moment” – which most likely will never happen – we are faced with a dictator whose family allowed the death of countless North Koreans to build nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.

In our optimism over the Trump-Kim summit, we forgot all the things that make us fear North Korea, what makes the nation a dangerous adversary, and why negotiating with the North will never be easy or ideal.

We forgot that Kim has over 100,000 people in political prison camps that can only be described as gulags, where prisoners are tortured, starved and killed for no reason.

We forgot that Kim has over 11,000 artillery and missile platforms pointed at the South Korean capital of Seoul, ready to strike at a moment’s notice. And with 25 million people in the Seoul metro area, just one missile armed with a conventional explosive slamming into a skyscraper would set off a chain reaction akin to 9/11 in New York – and likely far worse once more shells slammed down.

We forgot that Kim has over 5,000 tons of chemical weapons and most likely biological weapons – and could kill hundreds of thousands of people with these alone.

We forgot that we have been down this path before when it comes to Pyongyang and its openings, promises and attempts to pull at our hearts.

Sadly, I and many others let our hopes blind us to the reality that was right front of us.

Now we need to face reality in the wake of the summit’s cancelation: the chances of Kim giving up nuclear weapons – the only thing that guarantees his survival – are likely close to zero.

I had warned days ago that the planned summit was dead – and I was called crazy. I wish I had been wrong.

Considering how far apart Pyongyang and Washington are when it comes to denuclearization – with Kim apparently wanting to make an aspirational pledge, whereas the Trump administration is looking for concrete steps and a timeline – there was always a good chance the summit would never take place.

However, all hope is not lost. If Kim is willing to declare a clear plan of action that has a timeline for the removal of his nuclear weapons that is verifiable, then a summit is still possible. But frankly, that’s extremely unlikely.

If Kim wants a basket of incentives first before giving up anything – like a peace treaty, diplomatic recognition and the removal of sanctions – then we will never have a summit. In fact, we could very well go back to the same cycle of missile tests that brought us to the brink of armed conflict year.



But no matter what happens next, let’s just remember who we are dealing with in North Korea. Optimism be damned.",world
"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he didn't ""remember any negative interactions"" on the day in 2000 when he's accused of groping a reporter at a festival in British Columbia.

Allegations against Trudeau re-surfaced last week when a Calgary law professor posted a picture of an article claiming the then-teacher engaged in inappropriately ""handling"" a reporter. The story didn’t have a byline.

“I remember that day in Creston well,” Trudeau said on Sunday. “I had a good day that day. I don’t remember any negative interactions that day at all.”

The story originally appeared in the editorial section of the Creston Daily Advance, according to The Guardian. Trudeau at the time was 28 years old and was helping raise money at the British Columbia event to support avalanche safety after his brother had died in one in 1998.

The woman said she felt “blatantly disrespected” at the time, though the story didn’t offer many specifics about the incident, according to The Guardian.

“I’m sorry,” Trudeau allegedly told the woman at the time. “If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward.”

""I don’t remember any negative interactions that day at all."" - Canadian PM Justin Trudeau

The reporter was distressed about the alleged incident with Trudeau, Valerie Bourne, the paper’s former publisher, told CBC News. Bourne added she wouldn’t have classified the encounter as “sexual assault.”

“She didn’t like what had happened. She wasn’t sure how she should proceed with it, because of course we’re talking [about] somebody who was known to the Canadian community,” Bourne said.

Brian Bell, the editor of the paper at the time, believed the reporter, he told CBC News.

“I certainly believe that it happened,"" her said. ""This reporter was of a high character in my opinion and was professional in the way she conducted herself, and there’s no question in my mind that what was alluded to, written about in that editorial, did happen.""",world
"South Korea on Saturday expressed disappointment over the U.S. decision to call off Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s planned trip to North Korea, but insisted that continued diplomacy was vital to resolving tensions with Pyongyang.

""While we consider the delay of the visit to North Korea as unfortunate, we believe it's most important for the North Korea-U.S. dialogue -- including Secretary Pompeo's visits to North Korea -- to contribute to substantial progress in complete denuclearization and the establishment of a permanent peace regime in the Korean Peninsula,"" South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said.

On Friday, President Trump said he directed Pompeo to delay the trip because of a lack of progress in nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea, which he blamed on a lack of support from China.

Trump’s abrupt cancellation was interpreted by some as a concession that his prior claims of world-altering progress on the Korean Peninsula had been premature. Ending a period of animosity over North Korea's nuclear and missile development, Trump made history by meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June. But the meeting produced no binding agreement on how a nuclear-free peninsula would occur.

Post-summit nuclear talks got off to a rocky start, with North Korea accusing the U.S. of making “gangster-like” demands regarding denuclearization. The North for its part has been demanding the U.S. ease or lift sanctions that are crippling its economy as well as fast-track discussions to formally declare an end the 1950-53 Korean War, which technically never ended.

Pompeo and other administration officials have been skeptical about an end-of-war declaration in the absence of any progress on the nuclear matter.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who had lobbied hard for a Trump-Kim meeting, continues to push for talks with Pyongyang, which have led to a number of conciliatory steps. Moon is scheduled to visit Pyongyang in September for his third summit with Kim this year.

"Pope Francis, in a reversal of church teaching, said in a new policy published Thursday the death penalty is always “inadmissible” because it “attacks” the dignity of all people.

Previously, the Catechism of the Catholic Church said it didn’t exclude recourse to capital punishment “if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor.” The new teaching now states there are other ways to protect common good.

“Consequently the church teaches, in the light of the Gospel, that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person,” the new policy reads.

The Vatican defended the policy, saying it wasn’t contradicting past teaching but evolving it.

“If, in fact the political and social situation of the past made the death penalty an acceptable means for the protection of the common good, today the increasing understanding that the dignity of a person is not lost even after committing the most serious crimes,” said Cardinal Luis Ladaria, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

Francis has long been an opponent of the death penalty, saying it could never be justified no matter how bad the crime is.

At a 2017 ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the publication of the catechism, Francis said the death penalty violates the Gospel and amounts to the voluntary killing of a human life, which “is always sacred in the eyes of the creator.”

"The Catholic Church’s pushback Sunday against Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, author of the bombshell accusation of a sex abuse cover-up against Pope Francis, has ensnared a key figure in the U.S. culture wars: Kim Davis.

The Rev. Federico Lombardi and his English-language assistant, the Rev. Thomas Rosica, issued a joint statement late Sunday disputing Viganò’s claims about the encounter he organized with Davis during Pope Francis’ September 2015 visit to the United States. Davis, of Rowan County, Kentucky, made headlines around the world after she cited her own faith to deny marriage licenses to gay couples.

The Vatican had sought to downplay the encounter after conservatives presented it as a papal stamp of approval for Davis.

However, Viganò, the papal ambassador — or nuncio — to Washington between 2011 and 2016, said in a statement last Thursday that Francis knew well who Davis was, and that the Vatican approved the meeting in advance.

Francis was so enraged that Davis’ supporters had leaked word of the meeting that the Vatican subsequently insisted he only held one private audience while there: with one of his former students, a gay man and his partner, as Fox News previously reported.

In the joint statement Sunday, Rosica transcribed what he said were handwritten notes from a meeting he and Lombardi had with Viganò after the Davis encounter. In those notes, Rosica quoted Viganò as telling them that the pope had actually chastised him for ""deceiving"" him with the Davis meeting, and for having withheld the fact that Davis had been married four times.

In his part of the joint statement, Lombardi said Viganò initiated the Davis meeting, should have known about the furor that it would cause, and that even though Vatican officials approved of it, they were not sufficiently informed about the significance such a meeting would take on.

The timing of Viganò’s accusations has been seen by the progressive pope’s supporters as a deliberate attempt by more conservative factions to undermine his tenure, which has seen him reach out to homosexuals and divorced parishioners.

In a damning 11-page letter released to ultra-conservative media in Europe last Sunday, during the pope’s trip to Ireland, Viganò called on the pope to resign, accusing him of being among Church hierarchy who knew — and did little or nothing — about rumored indiscretions by ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick.

In fact, Viganò asserted, McCarrick was rehabilitated from sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI, promoted and made part of high-profile Vatican events even as rumors about him swirled.

Coupled with the devastating allegations of sex abuse and cover-up in a recent Pennsylvania grand jury report — which found that 300 priests had abused more than 1,000 children over 70 years in six dioceses — the scandal has led to calls for heads to roll and for a full Vatican investigation into who knew what and when about McCarrick.

Francis accepted McCarrick’s resignation as cardinal last month, after the U.S. church investigation determined that an accusation he had sexually abused a minor was credible.

Since then, another man has come forward to say McCarrick began molesting him starting when he was 11, and several former seminarians have said McCarrick abused and harassed them when they were in seminary. The accusations have created a crisis of confidence in the U.S. and Vatican hierarchy, because it was apparently an open secret that McCarrick regularly invited seminarians to his New Jersey beach house, and into his bed.

"The identities of some of those killed in the crash of a bus carrying a Canadian junior hockey team headed to a playoff game were revealed Saturday, as relatives learned the team’s coach and team captain were among the dead.

Also Saturday, police said a 15th person had died, with 14 others injured. Earlier, investigators said 14 were dead.

The 15 fatalities were 10 players, two coaches, the bus driver, a team volunteer and a broadcaster, the Saskatoon StarPhoenix reported.

The bus, carrying the Humboldt Broncos of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, collided with a semi-truck on a highway in Tisdale, Sask., around 5 p.m. There were 29 people onboard at the time of the crash, including the driver, police said.

Relatives of the team’s head coach Darcy Haugan and captain Logan Schatz confirmed their deaths.

CBC News reported Haugan’s death and his wife, Christina, confirmed the news to reporters. His sister also tweeted, “My brother didn’t make it…”

Schatz, 20, had been the captain for the past two and a half years of his four-year run on the team, his father, Kelly, told the Associated Press.

CRASH OF HOCKEY TEAM’S BUS LEAVES AT LEAST 14 DEAD, TOWN DEVASTATED

Tyler Bieber, a radio announcer who did play-by-play for the team, also died, the Associated Press reported. The AP cited Bieber's friend, Jordan Seipp, and manager whose company owns the Humboldt station, CHBO, where Bieber worked.

Police did not immediately release the names of all those who died.

The Broncos were on their way to Game 5 of the semifinals against the Nipawin Hawks. Nipawin is about 164 miles from Saskatoon. After receiving word of the crash, the Hawks announced on Facebook that the game had been canceled.

The truck driver was not injured during the crash and initially was detained but has since been released, RCMP Assistant Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said. The official added that an investigation was underway and the cause of the crash was not yet clear.

14 KILLED IN CRASH OF BUS CARRYING HOCKEY TEAM

The western Canadian town of Humboldt, Sask., which has a population of about 6,000, was devastated by the crash, with mourners leaving flowers at the Elgar Petersen Arena, home to the hockey team.

""It's overwhelming. It's been tough on everybody,"" Humboldt Mayor Rob Muench told the Associated Press. ""We're a small community, some of those kids have been on the team for a number of years. A lot grew up in the community and everybody knows each other.""

In a statement Saturday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the “entire country was in shock and mourning.”

“We are heartbroken knowing many of those we lost had their entire lives in front of them. We grieve with those facing news no parent or family should ever have to face,” Trudeau said. “This is every parent’s worst nightmare. No one should ever have to see their child leave to play the sport they love and never come back.”

Both President Trump and Vice President Pence tweeted Saturday offering their condolences for “the terrible Humboldt Team tragedy.”

Pope Francis on Saturday called for concrete action to combat the ""emergency"" of plastics littering seas and oceans, lamenting the lack of effective regulation to protect the world's waters.

Building on his papacy's concern for the environment, Francis issued a message aimed at galvanizing Christians and others to commit to saving what he hails as the ""impressive and marvelous,"" God-given gift of the ""great waters and all they contain.""

""Sadly, all too often many efforts fail due to the lack of effective regulation and means of control, particularly with regard to the protection of marine areas beyond national confines,"" the pope wrote.

""We cannot allow our seas and oceans to be littered by endless fields of floating plastic,"" Francis said. ""Here, too, our active commitment is needed to confront this emergency.""

Francis recommended a two-pronged approach, saying: ""We need to pray as if everything depended on God's providence and work as if everything depended on us.""

He also denounced as ""unacceptable"" the privatization of water resources at the expense of the ""human right to have access to this good.""

With countries from Italy to Australia promoting policies to thwart migrants from arriving by sea, Francis prayed that ""waters may not be a sign of separation of peoples, but of encounter for the human community.""

""Let us pray that those who risk their lives at sea in search of a better future may be kept safe,"" Francis added.

Malta and Italy have recently cracked down on charity-run boats which aim to rescue migrants from smugglers' unseaworthy boats. Other European Union nations, such as Hungary and Poland, have refused to share the burden of caring for some of the hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers who reached the continent's southern shores in recent years.

Francis didn't single out any countries. Instead, he directed part of his message to all politicians having to tackle migration and climate change, appealing for them to apply ""generous and farsighted responsibility.""

"A UK man poisoned by Novichok nerve agent in June was hospitalized for meningitis and the prognosis ""doesn't sound good at all,"" his brother said.

Charlie Rowley, 45, of Amesbury and his girlfriend Dawn Sturgess, 44, were poisoned by the nerve agent on June 29. The couple collapsed within a few hours of each other the next day. Sturgess died in the hospital about a week after being exposed, but Rowley managed to recover enough to be released from the hospital a few weeks later.

The two were poisoned four months after former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were attacked with the nerve agent. Sergei and Yulia Skripal both survived the attack.

Matthew Rowley said his brother was very sick and couldn’t move his arms or legs. He also said his brother lost his sight.

""I spoke to the nurse and asked what's the problem - they said it’s not looking good at the moment... reading between the lines it doesn't sound good at all,"" Rowley told Sky News.

""It might be the medication but he just doesn't sound right.""

Rowley said he didn’t believe his brother was the same after being poisoned and thought the hospital discharged him too soon.

""I said this all along – they released him from [the] hospital too early,"" he said. ""He went from intensive care to being released. I don't think they gave him a chance to recover his system, to pick up again.”

"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his South Korean counterpart will meet later this month to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, his state-controlled media reported Thursday.

Kim also expressed faith in President Trump efforts to settle a nuclear impasse, despite recent bumps in the diplomacy., the report said.

Chung Eui-yong, a special envoy from South Korea, told reporters that Kim stressed that ""he has never talked negative about President Trump to his staff or anyone else,"" South Korea's Yonhap News reported.

Chung reportedly said North Korea expressed hope to improve the ""North-U.S. relationship within Trump's first term.""

The statement comes after a South Korean envoy met with Kim to set up the inter-Korean summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

KCNA said Kim and the South Korean delegation reached a “satisfactory agreement” over the planned inter-Korean summit.

Kim was paraphrased as saying it was “his will to completely remove the danger of armed conflict and horror of war from the Korean peninsula and turn it into the cradle of peace without nuclear weapons and free from nuclear threat.""

The dates of the summit were expected to be released sometime Thursday.

Kim’s commitment to a nuclear-free Korean peninsula comes amid an impasse with the United States and growing skepticism of his intent to dismantle his nuclear weapons program.

His statement raises hopes that talks can get back on track following his meeting with President Trump in Singapore.

To overcome increasing dispute between Pyongyang and the U.S., Seoul is trying to persuade both countries to proceed with the denuclearization process simultaneously.

In addition, the South is aiming for a four-nation summit that would include China, to declare a formal end to the Korean War. Many see the peace declaration as a precursor to the North calling for the removal of all U.S. troops in the Korean Peninsula.

U.S. officials have insisted that the North must first takes steps to abandon its nuclear weapons before any peace declaration. Steps include allowing outside inspections, giving up some nuclear weapons during the early stages of negotiations and providing an account of components of its nuclear program.

Experts believe an end-of-war declaration could make it easier for North Korea to move toward discussions of a peaceful regime, diplomatic recognition and security concessions.

The North has routinely accused the United State of holding back the end-of-war declaration and making ""unilateral and gangster-like"" demands for denuclearization.

On Tuesday, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry issued a lengthy statement where it said an end-of-war declaration would be a necessary trust-building step that would ""manifest the political will to establish the lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.""

The declaration would be among several issues discussed, South Korean officials said, between North Korean officials and South Korean envoys.

Nuclear negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington have settled into a stalemate since the summit meeting between Kim and Trump.

Citing a lack of progress in denuclearization, Trump called of a planned visit to North Korea by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month.

Moon recently said the inter-Korean summit could warm relations between the Unites States, which maintains that efforts to improve relations should coincide with efforts to denuclearize the North.

""If needed, we should pull forward the negotiations for the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula with the development in relations between the South and North,"" Chung said.

Two past summits between the two Koreas in April and May removed fears of war between the two nations.

The frosty relationship between the United States and North Korea could present a tougher challenge for Moon’s third meeting with Kim, with his commitment to abandon his nuclear weapons in doubt.

"A Belgian couple and an apparent Iranian diplomat were among four people arrested over the weekend in connection with a planned bomb attack at a large rally held by Iranian opposition groups and attended by President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, authorities in Brussels said Monday.

The Iranian-heritage couple, identified only as 38-year-old Amir S. and 33-year-old Nasimeh N., were apprehended on Saturday after police stopped them and searched their car in the Woluwé-Saint-Pierre neighborhood of Brussels. Investigators found more than a pound of TATP explosives and a detonator, said Eric Van der Sijpt, spokesman for the Belgian prosecutor's office.

""We can say we arrested them just in time,"" Van der Sijpt told The Associated Press. TATP has been used in several terror attacks in Europe in recent years, including twin bombings in Brussels that killed 32 people in 2016.

Van der Sijpt added that two other men had been arrested in connection with the plot, one in France and one in Germany. The man arrested in Germany, the spokesman said, ""seems to be"" a diplomat attached to the Iranian embassy in Vienna, Austria. A report by Belgian broadcaster RTBF described the man as a ""contact"" of the arrested couple.

In a statement, Giuliani praised the ""fine work"" of law enforcement in France and Belgium and said the foiled attack ""accentuates the growing sense that the regime that is the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the world is increasingly weakened by constant large demonstrations in over 140 cities.""

Police estimated that 25,000 people attended the rally held by the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) in Villepinte, a suburb of the French capital. However, multiple sources said the attendance was between 80,000 and 100,000.

The NCRI's leader, Maryam Rajavi, tweeted Monday that Iran's embassies must be shut down and the Tehran regime's diplomats expelled.

""EU officials must question the mullahs why their answer 2 innocent ppl ... is 2 plant bombs & open fire?"" Rajavi tweeted. ""In the view of Iranians this regime is illegitimate & must go."" She added the hashtag ""#ExpelIranDiplomatTerrorists"".

The Iranian government reacted angrily to the arrests, with Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeting: ""How convenient: Just as we embark on a presidential visit to Europe, an alleged Iranian operation and its 'plotters arrested. Iran unequivocally condemns all violence & terror anywhere, and is ready to work with all concerned to uncover what is a sinister false flag ploy.""

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani began a two-day visit to Switzerland on Monday and is expected to travel to Austria next.

In addition to Giuliani, the American delegation at Saturday's rally included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson, former New Jersey Sen. Bob Toricelli, and former FBI Director Louis Freeh.

Van der Sijpt said he did not know whether the planned attack specifically targeted any attendees.

""All I can say is that they were planning a terrorist attack at a conference, I don't know if they were targeting somebody special,"" he said.

The main component of the NCRI is the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), a formerly armed group that had been on European Union and U.S. terrorism lists before being delisted from both.

Trump's recent appointment of John Bolton, who spoke at a MEK rally before he became national security adviser, and Giuliani, a regular MEK headliner, are seen as moves that could strengthen the group's bid for U.S. backing.

In his statement, Giuliani also praised Rajavi as a ""realistic alternative to this homicidal regime.""

""Nothing could be worse for these misogynists than a movement seen as replacing them headed by a heroic woman,"" Giuliani said.

In his sixth week of detention, Cafer Topkaya stopped counting the days in his prison diary, realizing he wouldn't be going home anytime soon.

Like many caught up in the crackdown after the failed military coup in Turkey two years ago, the 42-year-old naval officer had believed he could simply prove his innocence in court. But after weeks of sleeping on the floor in his cell, without enough food and with no explanation of the charges he faced, Topkaya said he understood the cards were stacked against him.

""After 39 days I lost my hope,"" he told The Associated Press in Brussels, where he rejoined his family this year after he managed to escape Turkey while on a conditional release from prison.

It's rare for military officers accused of supporting the coup to speak in public. Topkaya said he, too, was afraid to speak out — he doesn't feel entirely safe even in Belgium — but was inspired by the courage of a young Swedish woman whose recent protest aboard a passenger plane stopped the deportation of an Afghan migrant.

""Then I thought of the people in prison in Turkey. They can't meet with the press. They can't even meet with their lawyers. So they have no means to freely tell their stories, the things they endure,"" he said. ""So I felt a responsibility to talk on behalf of them and to tell their story and my story.""

Topkaya was working as a Turkish officer at NATO in Brussels when news broke of the military uprising against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that killed 250 people in July 2016. Erdogan blamed the attempted coup on Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally living in exile in the United States, and swiftly cracked down on suspected supporters of Gulen's movement across Turkey.

More than 130,000 people have since been purged from the public service. Over 77,000 have been arrested for alleged links to Gulen's network or Kurdish separatists, among them lawmakers, judges, prosecutors, military personnel, police and journalists.

Arrests continue, and the courts are swamped.

Topkaya, who says he supports neither Gulen nor Erdogan but the secular principles of modern Turkey's founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, said he only fully learned about the allegations against him 11 months into his ordeal.

The charge sheet said the father-of-three was accused of insulting Erdogan and government officials on Twitter. With a laugh, Topkaya noted that his supposed account was posting Tweets even when he was in jail without internet access.

The charge sheet also noted that he had used the ByLock messaging app that authorities say coup plotters communicated with, and that he was working for NATO. While Turkey is a longtime alliance member and hundreds of Turkish nationals are posted at NATO headquarters, being seen as pro-NATO or pro-Western is an indictment these days, Topkaya said.

If the charges seemed surreal to him, conditions in Sincan prison outside Ankara were all too real. Living with four men in a cell meant for three, Topkaya said he slept on the floor without heating in sub-zero temperatures that first winter.

""I had four pairs of socks and it was like my feet were still in ice buckets. Once I cried from being cold,"" he said.

When a U.N. monitoring team visited Sincan, inmates were given a second mattress, which Topkaya said felt ""like sleeping in a Hilton suite.""

Asked about Topkaya's case, a senior Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government rules, said only: ""We refuse to associate with Gulenists and do not find it necessary to respond to their claims.""

In a statement in December 2016 after visiting several Turkish prisons, U.N. envoy Nils Melzer said conditions were broadly ""acceptable"" though ""significantly overcrowded."" He noted inmate claims about ""the freezing temperature"" in one location, and ""numerous allegations of torture and other ill-treatment.""

Human rights group Amnesty International has reported extensively on cases of abuse and torture linked to the coup. Some of the worst punishment was reserved for military personnel.

Topkaya said he wasn't subjected to torture but spoke to prisoners who said they were.

Turkey's government insists it has a policy of zero tolerance to torture and says perpetrators are brought to justice.

This February, 16 months after Topkaya was lured to Ankara by commanders for an ""urgent meeting"" and detained, a judge granted him conditional release due to prosecution delays in substantiating its case, but he would have to report each week to police.

His diplomatic passport had been confiscated, but he still had an old normal one that was valid for a few more months and decided to use it. He fled to Greece a few weeks later and by March was back in Belgium, where his wife and children have refugee status.

""It was like coming to life again after death,"" he said. ""For the first few days we couldn't talk much. We just looked at each other's face and laughed, and sometimes we cried.""

In Turkey, though, Topkaya was called a traitor by his own brother, who applied to change his family name, according to Turkish media. The brother, who was also in the navy, was relieved of his duties because of his family ties to Topkaya and was waging a legal battle to be re-instated, media reports said.

""It's like a picture of what's happening in Turkey. Many families have been broken and split up like this,"" Topkaya said. ""I still love him,"" he added. ""I hope that like the rest of the nation he will one day wake from this dream and we will hug again.""",world
"A migrant woman and a toddler were abandoned and left to die in the Mediterranean Sea by the Libyan coast guard, a Spanish aid group alleged on Tuesday.

The group, Proactiva Open Arms, found the two bodies amid the remains of a destroyed migrant boat about 80 miles off the coast of Libya. Another woman was found alive.

The organization claimed that after the three migrants refused to board the Libyan vessels, they were abandoned – the Libyan coast guard had destroyed the boat they were on.

A spokesman for Libya's coast guard responded to the group's criticism late Tuesday, saying guard members carry out rescues of Europe-bound migrants ""in accordance with international standards in saving lives at sea.""

The head of the aid group, Oscar Camps, blamed the Italian government's cooperation with Libyan authorities for the death of the woman and the toddler.

CAPTAIN SAYS ITALY, MALTA AIM TO HIDE SEA DEATHS

Italy's new populist government has vowed to halt the influx of migrants across the Mediterranean and has given aid to Libyan authorities toward that end. Human rights activists have weighed in with sharp criticism, saying migrants being returned to Libya are at risk of beatings, abuse, rape and enslavement.

However, aid groups have been blocked from helping migrants in the Mediterranean, purportedly by being refused entry to ports or by having their vessels impounded.

City authorities said the 19-year-old suspect, identified only as Jawed S., appeared to target the American tourists in a stabbing attack at Central Station just after noon on Friday.

""Based on the suspect's first statements, he had a terrorist motive,"" the city administration said in a statement on Saturday. They did not elaborate on what the statements were or in what ways they might have shown intent.

Still, Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte doubled down on these claims after taking to Twitter to confirm that investigation was zeroing in the role played by extremist ideology.

Initial reports indicated that it did not appear to be a targeted attack, and that the victims did not appear to be chosen for a clear reason.

The victims were identified only as American citizens by the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands; police said they were recovering in a hospital with injuries that were considered serious but not life-threatening.

The suspect, who had a residency permit from Germany, was stopped by Dutch police officers when he was shot and wounded. He is scheduled to be arraigned during a closed-door hearing with an investigating judge on Monday. Officials have not disclosed the charges he could face.

"The Army has exonerated a decorated Fort Bragg chaplain and his assistant after they were accused of discrimination against a same-sex couple.

The chaplain – Army Maj. Scott Squires – and Sgt. Kacie Griffin, his assistant, had been facing dereliction of duty charges for declining to lead a marriage retreat that included a same-sex couple.

“We are grateful that the Army has rejected and abandoned these baseless charges,” First Liberty Institute attorney Mike Berry told the “Todd Starnes Radio Show.”

“The United States military is no place for anti-religious hostility against its own military chaplains,” said Berry, who is representing both the chaplain and the assistant. “Chaplains like Scott Squires and Kacie Griffin do not have to give up their First Amendment rights in order to serve their fellow soldiers.”

Squires said in a statement that he looks forward to resuming his military career and serving his fellow soldiers.

“I am eternally grateful to First Liberty for covering my six and fighting to restore my religious liberty,” Squires said.

The plight of Squires generated national outrage and thousands of my readers and listeners inundated the Pentagon with telephone calls and emails. And several members of Congress urged the military to take swift action.

“The case of Chaplain Scott Squires highlights how imperative it is that we protect freedom of conscience for every individual in the U.S. military – including the chaplains who minister to them as they carry out the military’s mission together,” U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., said in a statement.

In January, a same-sex couple asked to participate in a military-sponsored marriage retreat called, “Strong Bonds.” Squires had been scheduled to lead the retreat.

Squires is endorsed as a chaplain by the Southern Baptist Convention’s North American Mission Board (NAMB). According to NAMB policy, chaplains are prohibited from conducting “Strong Bonds” events for same-sex couples.

The NAMB policy clearly states that “endorsed chaplains will not conduct or attend a wedding ceremony for any same-sex couple, bless such a union or perform counseling in support of such a union … nor offer any kind of relationship training or retreat, on or off a military installation.”

When Squires realized he could not participate in the “Strong Bonds” event, he rescheduled the conference to accommodate the lesbian couple with a chaplain who could oversee the retreat. However, the same-sex couple chose not to attend.

Had Squires participated in the marriage retreat he would have risked losing his endorsement by the Southern Baptists. Likewise, the Army requires its chaplains to adhere to their endorsers’ rules and religious tenets.

“I simply did what I’m required to do under Army regulations and my endorser’s rules,” Squires said. “I am shocked that I would even be investigated, let alone threatened with punishment, for following the rules.”

The Pentagon was fundamentally transformed during the Obama administration. It became an institution rife with anti-Christian sentiment.

I documented countless instances of military personnel who were subjected to investigations and punishment because of their religious beliefs.

The Trump administration is working diligently to undo the damage that was done during the Obama administration.

However, some parts of the Pentagon are still stuck in muck and mire of the so-called swamp.

Just ask Chaplain Squires and his assistant.",world

The man easily favored to win Brazil's presidential election in October probably won't be on the ballot — blocked because of a conviction corruption that stems from a nationwide investigation that has ensnared many of the country's top businessmen and politicians. Here's a look at details of the case:

THE CONTROVERSY

Brazil's top electoral court is expected to soon rule on whether leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva can run for president despite a corruption conviction. Nearly all experts expect the court to rule against him, throwing the presidential race in the Latin America's largest nation into uncertainty.

That's causing renewed scrutiny at home and abroad of the 238-page conviction for corruption and money laundering imposed in July 2017 by Brazil's most famous judge.

Da Silva says the conviction and 12-year sentence amount to a ""coup"" by right-wing forces trying to prevent his return to office. Detractors say he's guilty and the nation can only move beyond a culture of endemic graft if the law applies to all.

Da Silva has won support abroad from figures including former U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and U.N.-appointed human rights experts. Writing an op-ed in the New York Times this month, Jorge Castaneda, a former Mexican foreign minister, also argued that da Silva should be allowed to run despite the conviction.

""The charges brought against him are too flimsy, the purported crime so petty (until now), the sentence so brazenly disproportionate and the stakes so high that in Latin America today, democracy should trump — so to speak — the rule of law,"" he wrote.

THE CASE

Judge Sergio Moro ruled that the former president helped steer contracts to construction company Grupo OAS before leaving office on Jan. 1, 2011.

In exchange, the judge said, da Silva was promised a renovated beachfront apartment worth about $1.1 million in Guaruja, a city outside of Sao Paulo.

Da Silva backers argue there was no crime because neither he nor his late wife ever legally owned the apartment. Moro said the intent to give it to him made it a crime.

Writing an op-ed in the New York Times this month, da Silva said the ""linchpin"" in the case against him was testimony from a man with a ""personal interest to tell authorities what they wanted to hear."" Da Silva was referring to former OAS president Leo Pinheiro, who got a reduced sentence after testifying that he met with da Silva in 2014 to discuss giving him the apartment as a gift.

Law professor Maristela Basso of the University of Sao Paulo said that a plea bargain in Brazil ""has to be combined with other evidence"" to win conviction. ""So to say it was all based on Pinheiro is not true.""

THE EVIDENCE

Witnesses testifying against da Silva included other top officials from OAS and another construction company, a former senator from da Silva's Workers' Party and a black-market money dealer at the center of the sprawling Carwash corruption investigation.

Prosecutors also presented text messages in which OAS executives discussed renovations on the apartment using code names ""boss"" and ""madam,"" allegedly referring to da Silva and his wife.

""The boss's kitchen project is ready, so we can set up an appointment with madam whenever you want,"" Paulo Gordilho, then OAS director, told Pinheiro, according to the sentencing document.

Moro noted that while OAS bought the building in 2009, it never put the unit in question up for sale or showed it to other potential buyers. Renovations to the apartment were made in 2014 after da Silva and his wife came to view it and before da Silva's wife made a second visit herself. Moro's decision says the work — which included installation of a sauna and increasing the size of a pool deck — is not the sort of renovation OAS typically does.

The deal apparently fell apart at some point in 2014, a time when Judge Moro and prosecutors were ramping up investigations into corruption in government contracts. Hundreds of businessmen and politicians, including many officials in da Silva's 2003-2010 administrations, were implicated.

DA SILVA'S VERSION

The former president acknowledged interest in buying the apartment as an investment, not receiving it as a gift. In his initial statements to investigators, da Silva said he decided against buying the apartment after his wife visited a second time in August 2014. He later changed that when testifying before Moro in 2017, saying he backed out after the couple's initial visit — before the renovations began that the judge says were made for them.

Cristiano Zanin, one of da Silva's attorneys, said the initial statements shouldn't have been part of the evidence because they were made when the former president was ""illegally detained"" for six hours in early 2016.

CONFIRMATION OR COINCIDENCE?

""The sentence is a jigsaw puzzle,"" said Rodrigo Falk Fragoso, a professor of criminal law at the Catholic Pontificate University in Rio de Janeiro. ""There isn't one direct piece of evidence of the property being transferred, but rather a combination of indications that the judge considered enough to determine a crime had been committed.""

DID THE PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME?

Even some who believe a conviction was warranted say the sentence is too long, largely because of the serious charge of money laundering.

Francisco Monteiro Rocha Junior, a law professor at the Federal University of Parana, argued that da Silva's actions didn't fit the legal definition of money laundering, which is hiding the origin of payments and using the money for lawful transactions in the future.

Still, the sentence length is in line with others leveled by Moro against politicians from opposition parties, such as former House Speaker Eduardo Cunha, sentenced to 15 years for corruption.

The length of the sentence reduces the chances that da Silva could get out of prison in time to run for office. Da Silva and supporters argue that ensuring he can't run has always been part of the plan by opponents.

THE APPEALS

The country's top court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal, which includes justices appointed by da Silva, earlier this year narrowly rejected his petition to be released from prison while he appeals. And in January, an appeals court with three magistrates unanimously upheld the conviction, of 9 ½ years, and extended it to 12 years and 1 month.

""Lula says there is a judicial conspiracy,"" said Jovacy Peter Filho, a criminal lawyer in Espirito Santo who thinks overall the evidence was weak. ""But it's harder to keep saying that after the appeals court upheld the conviction.""",world
"Terrorism was not being ruled out as a motive after a gunman fired into packed Toronto restaurants and cafes Sunday, killing two people and injuring 13 others before dying in a gun battle with police, officials said.

Ontario's Special Investigations Unit said in a news release two people were killed by a man who “fired shots at groups of people several times” while walking along Danforth Avenue.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders said cops were investigating ""every possible motive, including terrorism."" Saunders said the victims were an 18-year-old woman and 10-year-old girl. The 13 other victims ranged in age from 10 to 59-years-old

""I'm looking at every single possible motive for this,"" the Canadian top cop told reporters. ""When you have this many people struck by gunfire, it's a grave concern.""

Saunders said it was not clear if the gunman was killed by police or if he killed himself, but the Toronto Sun reported the suspect killed himself after the gunbattle. The SIU said the suspected gunman, a 29-year-old man, was located by police on Bowden Street and ""an exchange of gunfire took place."" The man fled the area and was located, deceased, on Danforth Avenue, according to the SIU.

Det. Sgt. Terry Brown of Toronto's homicide unit said during a news conference the shooting was a ""very rapid and fluid incident,"" and there are ""several scenes within the scene."" He said that some people have ""life changing injuries,"" and authorities are working to get a search warrant for the suspect's home.

SIU spokeswoman Monica Hudon said the agency is still working on identifying the shooter's identity and that authorities have the man's handgun. Hudon did not disclose any information on a possible motive for the rampage.

""The SIU's investigation will take as long as is necessary to conduct a thorough investigation,"" she told reporters. ""It takes as long as it needs to take.""

Hudon added that the suspect is from Toronto, and that the police watchdog will focus on what happened between police and the man. Toronto Police will focus on what took place before he was spotted by police.

A spokesperson with the Toronto Police told Fox News that officials are not identifying the gunman or other victims as of now. Investigators in the city's forensic, homicide, guns and gangs, and victim services units are on scene in addition to Toronto Police's canine unit, according to police.

Authorities received a call shortly after 10 p.m. about the incident in Toronto's Greektown neighborhood, a lively residential area with crowded Greek restaurants and cafes.

Witnesses reported hearing many shots and described the suspect walking past restaurants and cafes and patios on both sides of the street and firing into them.

John Tulloch told the Canadian Press he and his brother had just gotten out of their car when he heard about 20 to 30 gunshots.

""We just ran. We saw people starting to run, so we just ran,"" he said.

A video from one witness shows a man dressed in black clothes and a black hat walking quickly and firing three shots from the sidewalk into at least one shop or restaurant.

Dr. Najma Ahmed, a trauma surgeon with St Michael's Hospital and acting head of the trauma surgical unit, told reporters at a brief news conference on Monday that there were five patients at the hospital, including three who underwent ""immediate lifesaving surgery."" All five patients are in serious and critical condition, she added.

Another witness to the rampage told CP24 he was standing 10 to 15 feet away from the alleged gunman.

“He looked around 35, long hair, black hat. He had a dark shirt with long sleeves rolled up and black pants,” the man told the television station. “He was skinny, but he had this horrible look in his face, like he was under the influence or something.”

Andrew Mantzios told The Globe and Mail he heard gunshots ring out around 10 p.m. and saw a man dressed in all black walking towards the group of people he was with carrying a handgun.

“He had this horrible expression on his face,” Mantzios said.

Mantzios told the newspaper the gunman then fired at a group of people in the street.

“And then a lady tried to run and she fell down,” he said. “He turned around and shot her point blank, two or three times.”

Toronto Councilor Paula Fletcher told CP24 she was told the gunman was emotionally disturbed.

""It's not gang related. It looks like someone who is very disturbed,"" Fletcher said.

Councilor Mary Fragedakis also said she heard the gunman was disturbed.

Toronto Mayor John Tory said the city will be ""relentless"" in finding out what led to the shooting rampage, which he described as a “cowardly act of violence.”

""This is an attack against innocent families and against our entire city,"" he told the city council on Monday.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the rampage a ""terrible tragedy.""

""My thoughts are with everyone affected by the terrible tragedy on the Danforth last night in Toronto, and may the injured make a full recovery,"" he posted to Twitter. ""The people of Toronto are strong, resilient and brave - and we’ll be there to support you through this difficult time.""

Over the past weekend, Toronto police deployed dozens of additional officers to deal with a recent spike in gun violence in the city. The city's mayor has previously said the city has a gun problem.

The mass shooting comes a few months after the driver of a van plowed into pedestrians on a Toronto sidewalk, killing 10 people and injuring 14. Authorities have not disclosed a motive in that incident. But they have said the suspect, Alek Minassian, posted a message on social media referencing a misogynistic online community before the attack.

"North Korean state media accused the U.S. on Sunday of preparing for an invasion at the same time it is pursuing dialogue with the regime with a “smile on its face.”

An opinion piece in Rodong Sinum, the official newspaper of the Workers’ Party of Korea, alleged U.S. military drills in the region were “extremely provocative and dangerous” and threatened to derail any dialogue between the U.S. and North Korea.

The propaganda outlet cited a South Korean broadcast claiming that U.S. flew in “special units” from the Philippines simulating an “infiltration into Pyongyang.” The broadcast also claimed the USS Michigan nuclear submarine transported “Green Berets, Delta Force and other special units” from Japan to a South Korean naval base, according to The Washington Post.

The piece went on to accuse the U.S. of “hatching a criminal plot to unleash war” against North Korea and the crime would deserve “merciless divine punishment.”

“We cannot but take a serious note of the double-dealing attitudes of the U.S. as it is busy staging secret drills involving man-killing special units while having a dialogue with a smile on its face,” the piece said. “The U.S. would be sadly mistaken if it thinks that it can browbeat someone through trite ‘gunboat diplomacy’ which it used to employ as an almighty weapon in the past and attain its sinister intention.”

The U.S. military called the accusations “far fetched.”

Col John Hutcheson, U.S. Forces Japan director of public affairs, told The Washington Post he wasn’t sure what drills the newspaper was talking about.

“U.S. aircraft routinely fly from Japan to the Philippines and other nations around the region for a variety of training and operational reasons, so the notion that any single flight is related to North Korea is a bit far fetched,” he said.

Cmdr. Clay Doss, U.S. Seventh Fleet public affairs officer, told The Washington Post the report was “completely false.”

The accusations come days after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s trip was called off. President Trump said Friday he directed Pompeo to delay the trip because of a lack of progress in nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea, which he blamed on a lack of support from China.",world

Indian police on Tuesday arrested five rights activists for suspected links to Maoist rebels in raids on their homes and offices in several places in the country.

Police also accused the five of delivering speeches that triggered protests and violence between low-caste Dalits and right-wing groups near the western city of Pune in December. The government says Maoist rebels, who are active in several states, are India's biggest internal security threat.

The rebels, inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting the Indian government for more than four decades, demanding land and jobs for tenant farmers, the poor and indigenous communities.

Those arrested Tuesday were Telugu-language poet Varavara Rao in Hyderabad, Vernon Gonzalves and Arun Farreira in Mumbai, and Gautam Navalakha and Sudha Bhardwaj in New Delhi and a neighbouring town, the Press Trust of India news agency said.

The government crackdown was condemned by Aakar Patel, executive director of Amnesty International India, who said the arrests threatened core human rights values.

""All these people have a history of working to protect the rights of some of India's most poor and marginalized people. Their arrests raise disturbing questions about whether they are being targeted for their activism,"" Patel said.

Amitabh Behar, CEO of Oxfam India, said the government should protect people's rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly instead of creating an atmosphere of fear.

Police said the five activists arrested on Tuesday incited Dalits, members of Hinduism's lowest caste, to counter right-wing groups at a rally on Dec. 31, leading to violent clashes that left one person dead.

In June, police arrested five other activists on suspicion of also inciting the Dalits, who have been marginalized for centuries and forced to perform jobs considered unacceptable by other castes.

Caste prejudice is endemic in Hindu-majority India, even though the constitution outlaws the practice and has made it a crime punishable by up to a year in prison.",world
"Turkey blamed military officers loyal to a U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen for a failed military coup attempt on July 15, 2016 and declared a state of emergency five days later to clampdown on a vast network of alleged Gulen supporters in the military and other state institutions. The state of emergency led to mass arrests and purges.

Opponents say President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government used its emergency powers to crackdown on all dissent — not just Gulen's movement. The cleric denies involvement in the coup.

The two-year-old state of emergency expired in July, after Erdogan kept to an electoral campaign promise not to extend it, but new anti-terror laws enacted since then allow authorities to press ahead with mass purges of public employees.

Here's a look at Turkey's post-coup crackdown:

ARRESTS:

Some 160,000 people were detained for questioning, of which over 77,000 were formally arrested for alleged links to terror organizations, including Gulen's network and outlawed Kurdish rebels. Those arrested include military personnel, police, journalists, lawmakers, judges and prosecutors.

According to Justice Ministry figures, close to 35,000 people put on trial for links to Gulen's network have been convicted so far. Around 14,000 others were acquitted.

PURGES:

More than 130,000 people have been purged from the public service through emergency government decrees. Those dismissed include tens of thousands of teachers and close to 6,000 academics. Around 1,300 people were re-instated to jobs by a commission that was set up to review cases but 18,000 other appeals were rejected.

MILITARY:

Some 170 generals and around 7,000 other senior military officers were arrested as part of the crackdown. At least 58 generals and 629 senior officers have been convicted to life terms in prison so far in trials against military officers, according to Justice Ministry figures. Eight generals were acquitted.

MEDIA:

At least 143 journalists or media workers are currently behind bars, most accused of links to Gulen or Kurdish rebels, according to the Turkish Journalists Syndicate. Using emergency decrees, the government closed down around 200 media organizations, including newspapers, periodicals, radio stations and television channels.

POLITICIANS:

Ten legislators from Turkey's pro-Kurdish political party, including former co-chairs Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag, are in prison on terror charges for alleged links to Kurdish militants. Enis Berberoglu, a legislator from the main opposition Republican People's Party, is in prison convicted of espionage for giving an opposition newspaper images allegedly showing Turkey's intelligence agency trucking weapons into Syria.

ACTIVISTS:

Human rights activist and businessman Osman Kavala is in jail pending trial, accused of seeking to overthrow the government and having alleged links to Gulen. Eleven prominent activists were arrested last year at their hotel on an island off of Istanbul while on training. They were eventually released from jail pending the outcome of their trial for supporting terror groups. Among them was Taner Kilic, Amnesty International's former Turkey chairman, who was released earlier this month.",world

"A former scout worker was arrested Sunday in Spain in connection with the 1998 murder of a Dutch boy who was murdered at summer camp in the Netherlands that led to one of the country’s most extensive murder investigations, officials said.

Spanish authorities located Jos Brech, 55, in a mountainous region near the town of Castelltercol, about 31 miles from Barcelona, AFP reported. Brech was arrested in the murder of 11-year-old Nicky Verstappen after a resident reported seeing the alleged killer following a news conference last week, Dutch police said.

Authorities had put out photos last Wednesday of Brech asking the public for help finding him.

Verstappen vanished from his summer camp in Brunssum two decades ago and was found dead near a Christmas tree plot the next day, about half a mile away from the campsite. Police found the boy was sexually abused before he was killed.

Brech, then 35, was interviewed by police at the time of the 1998 murder, but was not named a person of interest.

For years, investigators combed through details in the case in hopes of finding the killer. A DNA profile in the case was developed in 2008 using samples found on Verstappen’s clothes. However, it wasn’t until February when police asked 21,500 men to donate their DNA samples that the case moved forward.

About 16,000 men volunteered to give DNA samples. Brech did not come forward in the DNA request, putting him on police’s radar, according to AFP.

Authorities went looking for Brech in France’s Vosges region after his family reported him missing in April. They were able to gather DNA from personal belongings left at Brech’s chalet and matched it to those found in Verstappen’s clothing, AFP reported.

Brech is in Spain awaiting extradition to the Netherlands. He is accused of murder, sexual aggression and kidnapping.",world

A plane from China landing on a rain-soaked Manila runway in poor visibility veered off in a muddy field with one engine and a wheel ripped off but no serious injuries among the 165 people aboard who scrambled out through an emergency slide, officials said Friday.

Only four passengers sustained scratches and all the rest including eight crew aboard Xiamen Air Flight 8667 were safe and taken to an airport terminal, where they were given blankets and food before going to a hotel, airport general manager Ed Monreal told a news conference.

The Boeing 737-800 from China's coastal city of Xiamen at first failed to land apparently due to poor visibility that may have hindered the pilots' view of the runway, Director-General of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines Jim Sydiongco told reporters. The plane circled before landing on its second attempt near midnight but lost contact with the airport tower, Sydiongco said.

The aircraft appeared to have ""bounced"" in a hard landing then veered off the runway and rolled toward a rain-soaked grassy area with its lights off, Eric Apolonio, spokesman of the civil aviation agency said, citing an initial report about the incident.

A Chinese passenger, Wang Xun Qun, who was traveling with her daughter, said in halting English that they embraced each other and were ""very scared"" before the aircraft landed in a rainstorm. She motioned with her finger how their plane circled for about an hour before the pilots attempted to land.

""Half lucky,"" the 15-year-old daughter said when asked to describe their experience. ""Scary, scary.""

Monreal expressed relief a disaster had been avoided. ""With God's blessing, all passengers and the crew were able to evacuate safely and no injuries except for about four who had some superficial scratches,"" he said.

Investigators retrieved the plane's flight recorder and will get the cockpit voice recorder once the aircraft has been lifted to determine the cause of the accident, Sydiongco said.

Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Manila's main international gateway, will be closed most of Friday while emergency crews remove excess fuel then try to lift the aircraft, its belly resting on the muddy ground, away from the main runway, which was being cleared of debris, officials said. A smaller runway for domestic flights remained open.

TV footage showed the plane slightly tilting to the left, its left badly damaged wing touching the ground and its landing wheels not readily visible as emergency personnel, many in orange overalls, examined and surrounded the aircraft. One of the detached engines and landing wheels lay a few meters (yards) away.

A Xiamen Air representative, Lin Hua Gun, said the airline will send another plane to Manila to resume the flight. The Civil Aviation of China said it was sending a team to assist in the investigation.

Several international and domestic flights have been canceled or diverted due to the closure of the airport, which lies in a densely populated residential and commercial section of metropolitan Manila. Airline officials initially said the airport could be opened by noon but later extended it to four more hours.

Hundreds of stranded passengers jammed one of three airport terminals due to flight cancellations and diversions. Dozens of international flights were cancelled or either returned or were diverted elsewhere in the region, officials said.

Torrential monsoon rains enhanced by a tropical storm flooded many low-lying areas of Manila and northern provinces last weekend, displacing thousands of residents and forcing officials to shut schools and government offices. The weather has improved with sporadic downpours.

A Philippine senator who has taken refuge in the Senate to avoid an arrest order by President Rodrigo Duterte asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to declare the order illegal and called on the military to defy it.

Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, Duterte's fiercest critic in Congress, told the high court in a petition that Duterte's proclamation voiding his 2011 amnesty for links to failed coup attempts and ordering his arrest was baseless.

""Their basis for this proclamation is a big lie,"" Trillanes told reporters in the Senate building, where he has remained since Duterte's order was made public Tuesday. ""It's bogus, they only wanted to pin me down for being a critic of Mr. Duterte.""

Known for his temper and outbursts against critics, Duterte has openly expressed anger against Trillanes, who has accused him of large-scale corruption and involvement in illegal drugs. Duterte has repeatedly denied the allegations.

The standoff has unfolded while Duterte is on a visit to Israel and Jordan. He is scheduled to fly home on Sunday.

The Department of Justice said Duterte voided Trillanes's amnesty because the senator did not file a formal amnesty application and admit guilt for his role in past coup attempts.

Trillanes, however, has presented TV and newspaper reports, along with defense department documents, showing he applied for the amnesty and acknowledged his role in three military uprisings between 2003 and 2007.

Trillanes, 47, a former navy officer, was jailed for more than seven years for involvement in the army uprisings, including a 2003 mutiny against then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo when he and other young officers rigged part of a road in the Makati financial district with bombs and took over an upscale residential building.

He and the other mutineers then demanded an end to government corruption and other irregularities. They surrendered after negotiations.

After being amnestied under Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, Trillanes successfully petitioned two Philippine courts to dismiss rebellion and coup cases against him, allowing him to later run for public office.

Duterte also ordered the Department of Justice and the military to restart administrative and criminal complaints against Trillanes. The order has sparked legal questions, with experts asking whether Duterte can invalidate an amnesty declared by a previous president and approved by Congress.

In his Supreme Court petition, Trillanes said Duterte's arrest order violated the constitution, which only empowers the judiciary to issue arrest warrants.

Despite legal questions, the Department of Defense said it has deployed officers to the Senate to take custody of Trillanes and have him face a military court of inquiry into his role in the past uprisings. A military detention cell was also being readied for him.

Trillanes called on military officials to defy Duterte's order, which he said was illegal. He cited abuses and wrongdoings by the military when then dictator Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972. Marcos was overthrown in a 1986 army-backed ""people power"" revolt.

""They know the lessons in history, they know what happened during martial law, they know a legal and illegal order,"" Trillanes said in a news conference.

Since Duterte took office in 2016, another opposition senator has been jailed on illegal drugs charges, a critical Supreme Court chief justice has been ousted by fellow judges, and foreign critics, including an Australian nun, have been barred from entering the Philippines or threatened with deportation.",world
"Amidst so much war and terrorism in the Middle East, there is actually remarkably good news coming out of Saudi Arabia.

A reformer is rising, pursuing the most dramatic economic, social and foreign policy changes in the history of the kingdom.

His name is Mohammed bin Salman. Widely known simply as “MBS,” he’s young. On August 31st, he will turn just 33 years old. Yet he has already amassed tremendous power. In January 2015, he became Defense Minister. In June 2017, he was named Crown Prince, and thus heir to throne.

With the blessing of his father, King Salman, he’s moving quickly to expand women’s rights, diversify the country’s oil-based economy, confront violent Islamism and even advance peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

“We are…reverting to what we [once] followed – a moderate Islam open to the world and all religions,” MBS told a conference of investors in Riyadh. “We want to lead normal lives, lives where our religion and our traditions translate into tolerance, so that we coexist with the world and become part of the development of the world.”

Radicals like Hamza bin Laden – son of the late terrorist mastermind – accuse MBS of being too moderate and working too closely with Washington. ISIS leaders despise MBS and have threatened to launch attacks in the kingdom. Iranian proxy forces in Yemen have fired more than 100 missiles at Saudi Arabia since 2015 and drawn MBS into a deadly and expensive war.

Liberals attack MBS for not being moderate enough. Human Rights Watch argues that “since [MBS] has ascended to power, there’s been an intensified repression of dissent.” Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says she is “very alarmed” by recent Saudi decisions, and Tweeted that Ottawa is “gravely concerned” about the state of civil society in the kingdom.

Yet consider 21 impressive reforms MBS and his team have advanced already.

1. On June 24, 2018, it became legal for women to drive in the kingdom. More than 120,000 Saudi women have already applied for licenses, and officials expect there to be 3 million women drivers by 2020.

2. Saudi women may now attend soccer matches and sporting events.

3. Woman are no longer required to wear the long black cloak known as the abaya.

4. Gyms and fitness centers for women are opening throughout the kingdom.

5. Women’s sports teams are forming in the kingdom.

6. Saudi women may now join the military and intelligence services.

7. Movies theaters are legally opening for the first time in 35 years.

8. Concerts by international artists are now permitted.

9. Tourist visas are now available for international travelers to visit the kingdom without having to pay an exorbitant fee.

10. MBS has launched a strategy called “Vision 2030” to wean the kingdom off of oil revenues – what he calls their “dangerous addiction to oil” – and diversify the economy.

11. Financial reforms are being made to attract international investors.

12. MBS has launched an anti-corruption campaign and already recovered $100 billion from officials allegedly bilking the government.

13. MBS and his father have committed some $500 billion to build a futuristic new city along the Red Sea called “NEOM” that will link Saudi Arabia with Egypt and Jordan and create high-tech businesses and thousands of new jobs.

14. The Crown Prince is increasingly outspoken that the most serious threat to peace in the Mideast is not Israel but Iran, and he’s urging world leaders to join forces to neutralize the Iran threat. In an interview with The Atlantic, MBS warned, “The [Iranian] supreme leader is trying to conquer the world. He believes he owns the world….He is the Hitler of the Middle East. In the 1920s and 1930s, no one saw Hitler as a danger. Only a few people. Until it happened. We don’t want to see what happened in Europe happen in the Middle East. We want to stop this through political moves, economic moves, intelligence moves. We want to avoid war.”

15. Last year, the Saudis opened a new Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology, aimed at “refuting extremist rhetoric….combating its activities and curbing its impact….[and] promoting moderation, tolerance and coexistence.”

16. During his March visit to the U.S., the Crown Prince held a rare and impressive meeting with Jewish and Catholic leaders. The Jerusalem Post reported that MBS met leaders of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the American Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League, the Conference of President of Major American Jewish Organizations, B’nai B’rith International and the Jewish Federations. “The meeting emphasized the common bond among all people, particularly people of faith, which stresses the importance of tolerance, coexistence, and working together for a better future for all of humanity,” read a statement by the Saudi Embassy in Washington.

17. The Crown Prince stunned observers in April by publicly announcing that Israel has the “right” to exist on “their own land” as a “Jewish nation-state.”

18. Flights to Israel from India are now allowed to fly over the kingdom.

19. MBS is taking an active role behind the scenes in urging the Palestinian leadership to end the 70-year stalemate with Israel and forge a comprehensive peace treaty. Intelligence and security cooperation between Saudi and Israeli officials is underway and increasing.

20. In January, a high-ranking Saudi religious cleric publicly denounced those who deny the Holocaust, writing: “This human tragedy perpetrated by evil Nazism won’t be forgotten by history, or meet the approval of anyone, except criminal Nazis or their genre. True Islam is against these crimes.”

21. The Crown Prince has also held unprecedented meetings with Christian leaders, including the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Egyptian Coptic Pope Tawadros II. MBS even visited a Coptic Church in Cairo, publicly declared Christians are welcome to visit the kingdom, and called for inter-faith tolerance and dialogue between Christians and Muslims.

Are more reforms needed? To be sure.

Yet clearly something historic is underway in Saudi Arabia. In a region of radicals, a reformer is rising. MBS and his team should be lauded for the progress they have made, and encouraged to keep going.",world
"A 55-year-old man was arrested Sunday in connection to a protest that saw him paraglide within meters of President Donald Trump as he visited his golf course in Scotland on Friday, officials said.

The man, not yet identified, was spotted breaching a no-fly zone carrying a banner reading, “Trump: Well Below Par,” as he flew just meters past the U.S. leader at his Turnberry resort in Ayrshire.

“Police Scotland can confirm that a 55-year-old man has been arrested in connection with an incident when a powered parachute was flown in the vicinity of the Turnberry Hotel around 9.45 pm on Friday, 13 July 2018,” a spokesman told the Independent in a statement.

No further details were released.

TRUMP HITS COURSE AFTER PARAGLIDER FLEW OVER HIS SCOTLAND GOLF RESORT

The stunt, orchestrated by environmental group Greenpeace, was slammed by police who claimed the man had placed himself in “grave danger” as snipers watched from the hotel’s roof.

Police said the protester breached a no-fly zone over the hotel and committed a criminal offense, but the environmental group said it had informed police about the stunt before it took place.

Footage of the incident shows Trump cutting across the grass, quickly heading to the entrance of the resort soon after the glider appeared.

"The Ukrainian city of Lviv, once a major center of Jewish life in Eastern Europe, is commemorating the 75th anniversary of the annihilation of the city's Jewish population by Nazi Germany and honoring those working today to preserve what they can of that vanished world.

City authorities honored recipients during Sunday's ceremony with 75 sculptured glass keys modeled by an American artist on an old metal synagogue key that she found at a Lviv market. The ceremonies, including a concert amid the ruins of synagogues, come amid a larger attempt to revive the suppressed memories of the Jews who were once an integral part of life in the region.

""God forbid our city once suffered such a misfortune,"" Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadoviy said at the ceremony. ""Today we cannot even imagine for a moment the pain, humiliation and grief that thousands of Lviv's people suffered in the last century.""

Iryna Matsevko, deputy director of the Center for Urban History of East Central Europe and one of the organizers, said it was the first time the western Ukrainian city has acknowledged the efforts in such an extensive way.

She said it comes amid a growing consciousness in Ukrainian society of the need to remember the Jews who were annihilated by Nazi forces during their occupation of Eastern Europe, which occurred with the participation of local people in some cases. The new efforts have included Jewish history courses at universities, new research by young Ukrainian scholars and grassroots efforts by local teachers and other volunteers that otherwise get little attention. Volunteers have also worked to recover Jewish gravestones that were used to pave roads and return them to cemeteries.

""This is part of the process of reviving the memory of the Jewish heritage. Of course, this process is slow. I want it to be quicker, but for the last 10 years we have seen how the Jewish heritage is returning to people's consciousness and a lot of activities are taking place,"" Matsevko said. ""It is very important that people are being acknowledged for their work in Jewish heritage.""

Before World War II, Lviv and the surrounding area belonged to Poland. Then called Lwow, it was the third largest Jewish community in prewar Poland after Warsaw and Lodz, with most working as merchants, manufacturers or artisans. Before World War I, Lviv and the surrounding area were part of the eastern Galicia region of the Austro-Hungarian empire and the city was called by its German name, Lemberg.

In June 1941, Germany attacked the Soviet Union, its former ally. As soon the German forces entered the city they and their Ukrainian collaborators massacred Jews in the city and countryside. While occupying the area, Germans murdered Jews in the ghetto, the Belzec death camp and a forced labor camp, Janowska, with the final annihilation occurring in 1943, the anniversary that was being marked Sunday.

Of a population of about 150,000 Jews, only an estimated 1 percent survived.

In the postwar years, with Ukraine part of the Soviet Union, the memories of the murdered Jews began to vanish. Historian Omer Bartov has called the area a ""land of memory and oblivion, coexistence and erasure, high hopes and dashed illusions.""

The remembrance work is taking place as Ukraine finds itself mired in crisis and conflict following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and with a Russia-backed insurgency in the east. With Ukraine under attack, nationalism has been on the rise, with some lauding the Nazi-affiliated irregulars who fought against the Soviet Army in World War II. To what extent this has led to greater anti-Semitism is a matter of dispute, but many of those working in the area of Jewish remembrance feel that anti-Semitism is exaggerated and part of a Russian propaganda effort.

The glass keys are the work of New Mexico-based artist Rachel Stevens, who found a rusted synagogue key at a street market in Lviv in February while seeking remnants of Jewish culture in eastern Galicia as part of a research project.

She reproduced them in glass, which in Jewish tradition ""represents the fragility of life,"" she said, explaining that the ""glass synagogue keys became a tangible way for me to express my grief about the past and my hope for the future.""

""The idea for this artwork seems almost mystically delivered to me,"" Stevens said.

"Scotland’s former first minister, who once took the country to the brink of independence from the United Kingdom, has resigned from his party after being accused of sexual harassment.

Alex Salmond, a towering force in British politics for more than three decades, resigned from the Scottish National Party on Thursday amid an investigation into claims he harassed two members of staff when he was first minister in 2013.

He said he was quitting to prevent division in the party, but said he rejected “any suggestion of criminality” and is suing the SNP government over the way it handled the complaints process against him.

“For my part I have always thought it a very poor idea to suspend any party member on the basis of complains and allegations,” Salmond said in a statement. “Innocent until proven guilty is central to our concept of justice.”

STUNNING DINOSAUR DISCOVERY: 170-MILLION-YEAR-OLD FOOTPRINT FOUND IN SCOTLAND

However, he has been accused of “dragging Scotland into the gutter” for launching a crowdfunding effort to help pay for his legal costs. He asked supporters for $65,000 (£50,000) to help cover the judicial review at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. He has already surpassed that target.

Rhoda Grant, a member of the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Labour party, said: “That an independently wealthy man with his celebrity and political power is to raise legal fees through a crowdfunder for a case ultimately linked to sexual harassment is unbelievable.

“It suggests that he is sending a signal to those who have made allegations that he has the upper hand,” she added. “Decent people will rightly be furious that he is to raise money to take the Scottish Government to court. Alex Salmond is abusing his power, and dragging Scotland into the gutter.”

THERESA MAY DISMISSES CALLS FOR 2ND BREXIT VOTE AS NINTH PARLIAMENT MEMBER RESIGNS

Jack McConnell, Salmond’s predecessor as Scotland’s leader, urged people to instead donate to charities which help victims of sexual assault and harassment. Nicola Sturgeon, the current first minister who took over from Salmond in 2014, shared a link on her Twitter account promoting Women’s Aid.

In a statement on Twitter, Sturgeon said she felt a “huge sadness about this whole situation” and paid tribute to her “friend and mentor for almost 30 years”

But she added: “The hard fact remains that two complaints were received by the Scottish Government that could not be ignored or swept under the carpet. Complaints must be investigated without fear or favor, regardless of the seniority of the person involved.”

Scotland’s Daily Record newspaper, which first reported the allegations last week, claims one of the two staff members accused an alcohol-fueled Salmond of making unwanted advances to her while at the first minister’s official residence Bute House in Edinburgh in December 2013.

After being investigated by the government’s permanent secretary Leslie Evans for eight months, the complaints were subsequently passed to the police.

Salmond first became leader of the SNP in 1990 and served for 10 years, during which time the Scottish Parliament was established.

He returned to the role and was elected first minister in 2007 when the SNP swept to power. He stepped down seven years later after leading, and losing, the campaign for an independent Scotland.

"Hurricane Lane, which is headed toward Hawaii, strengthened on Tuesday to a Category 5 storm, the National Weather Service announced.

Continue Reading Below

The hurricane could now produce winds 157 mph or above, heavy rain, flash flooding and high surf. The winds are capable of knocking down trees and power poles, the NWS said.

The hurricane is about 500 miles southeast of Honolulu as of Wednesday morning.

Hurricane Lane “is forecast to move dangerously close to the main Hawaiian islands as a hurricane later this week, potentially bringing damaging winds and life-threatening flash flooding from heavy rainfall,” the weather service’s Central Pacific Hurricane Center warned.

Earlier Tuesday, the weather service issued a hurricane warning for Hawaii island and a hurricane watch for Oahu, Maui and other smaller islands, meaning tropical storm-force winds, excessive rain and large swells could arrive starting Wednesday.

The weather service also issued a hurricane watch for Maui and other smaller islands, meaning tropical storm-force winds, excessive rain and large swells could arrive starting Wednesday. It’s possible Oahu and Kauai may later be included in an advisory for the hurricane.

But the hurricane center said the storm will move very close to or over the islands from Thursday through Saturday.

Hawaii Gov. David Ige signed an emergency proclamation on Tuesday in anticipation of the storm, which would provide relief for disaster damages, losses and suffering as a result of the hurricane.

Hawaii residents rushed to stores to stock up on bottled water, ramen, toilet paper and other supplies.

Maui County and Big Island schools will be closed starting Wednesday until further notice, the state Department of Education said. All after-school activities statewide are canceled for the rest of the week.

Longtime Hawaii residents recalled a devastating 1992 hurricane as they prepared for Hurricane Lane.

Kauai resident Mike Miranda was 12 when Hurricane Iniki devastated the island 26 years ago. He said Iniki's turn into the islands was sudden.

""A lot of people are comparing the similarities between Iniki and Lane,"" he said. ""I remember how very little rain fell. But I remember the wind being the strongest force of nature I've ever witnessed and probably the scariest sounds I've ever heard in my life.""

Utility poles were down all over the island, and his 7th-grade classes were held in Army tents for several months.

"A 19-year-old American tourist visiting Australia plunged to his death from a cliff while taking a selfie, police said.

The unidentified man was part of a group visiting a popular whale-watching clifftop called Cape Solander, south of Sydney, on Monday when he slipped, falling about 30 feet into the sea below.

A lifesaver helicopter, which arrived about seven minutes after he fell, used green dye to help trace the currents. He was found unconscious just below the water’s surface “directly below the whale watching platform” about 30 minutes later, a spokesman for Westpac Life Save Rescue Helicopter told news.com.au.

Paramedics pulled him onto dry land, but were unable to revive him after performing CPR.

“He was here with a group of friends to go whale watching. They've made their way down onto the rock platform at this stage it appears to be misadventure where he's slipped and fallen over the edge,” New South Wales Police Chief Inspector Chris Hill told the Daily Telegraph.

The man’s death comes about a month after a man in his 30s died after falling from the same spot while whale watching, news.com.au reported.

“Those rocks are very slippery. For your safety, we recommend that you stay up on the whale watching platform and please don’t go down on the rocks,” hill told the Australian Associated Press.

Cape Solander is considered one of Sydney’s best whale-watching locations, as hundreds of humpback whales migrate in June and July to the warmer waters.

"A marriage between a 41-year-old Malaysian Muslim man and an 11-year-old Thai girl prompted widespread outcry and calls for child brides to be banned as authorities launch an investigation.

Che Abdul Karim Che Abdul Hamid secretly married his third wife in Thailand. The marriage was only made known after one of Che Abdul Karim’s wives lodged a complaint with police. The girl in question is set to meet with Malaysian officials Monday to discuss the marriage, authorities said.

Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said the marriage was illegal because it hadn’t been approved by the Shariah court. Muslim girls under the age of 16 can wed with the consent of a Shariah court and their parents. Muslim men in Malaysia can marry four wives.

Che Abdul Karim, who is a rubber scrap dealer and an imam in a rural Malaysian village, has two wives and six children between the ages of 5 and 18. Photos on social media showed Che Abdul Karim holding the hand of his new wife. The photo had since-been deleted.

The marriage was lawful and approved by the girl’s parents, he told the Bernama news agency. He said he will wait until the girl is 16 to formalize the marriage in Malaysia.

“I know that my third wife is only 11 years old, that she does not attend school and that she has to reach the age of 16 for us to live together. [She] agrees to this too,” Che Abdul Karim told Bernama.

Officials were investigating whether the parents approved the marriage due to poverty, Wan Azizah told local media. The girl’s parents are rubber tappers who work for Che Abdul Karim, the Borneo Post reported.

Wan Azizah said the initial investigation concluded that the girl was wooed twice and that her mother told the man the girl was too young for marriage and asked for it to be consummated only when she turns 16.

“Pedophilia, child exploitation, child pornography... we must be firm on this as children are our responsibility,” Wan Azizah said.

The U.N. children agency slammed the child marriage, calling it “shocking.” The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia expressed concern that allowing child marriage in the name of religion might ""provide cover for pedophiles and child sexual predators.""

The National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, also known as Rio Museu Nacional, caught fire late Sunday after the building had closed for the day, according to O Globo. It was not immediately clear what sparked the fire; the museum reportedly had infrastructure problems in recent years.

"A Thai boy was beaten to death by an incensed Buddhist monk after the child displayed ""playful"" behavior during a temple prayer session, Thai police said Friday.

Monk Suphachai Suthiyano, 64, allegedly assaulted Wattanapol Sisawad, 9, with a bamboo stick and slammed the boy's head against a pillar before Sisawad fell into a coma last weekend, AFP reported. Sisawad died as a result of his injuries on Thursday.

Suthiyano reportedly flew into a rage after the young boy disrupted a Buddhist ceremony at the temple in Kanchanaburi, Thailand, two hours west of Bangkok.

Thai police originally charged Suthiyano with assault when he was arrested Sunday, but, after the boy’s death, the charge will be revised to assault resulting in death, authorities said.

"Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen vowed that “no one can obliterate Taiwan’s existence” on Sunday amid pressure from China to stamp out references to the island.

China has long claimed the self-ruled democratic island as its own, but it has stepped up a campaign more recently as it tries to assert Chinese sovereignty by ordering foreign companies to label Taiwan as a part of China.

Also, Reuters reports that China also has been whittling down the number of countries that recognize Taiwan, now just 18, with Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic switching relations to Beijing this year.

Speaking before her flight to Los Angeles, where she will spend one night prior to visiting Belize and Paraguay, Tsai struck a defiant tone.

“In going abroad, the whole world can see Taiwan; they can see our country as well as our support for democracy and freedom,” Tsai said, reports Reuters. “We only need to be firm so that no one can obliterate Taiwan’s existence.”

China, which believes Tsai wants to push for Taiwan’s formal independence, has already complained to the United States about her American stopovers, which include Houston on her way back.

Although Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo with China, she will also be looking to reaffirm Washington-Taipei ties and to shore up support ahead of local elections in Taiwan in November amid renewed pressure from Beijing.

During her U.S. stops, Tsai will also meet with business representatives to discuss how Taiwan could drum up investment and procurement with the U.S.

France's foreign minister says Syrian President Bashar Assad has won his country's civil war but won't ""win the peace"" without a political solution brokered by the international community.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also reiterated threats of Western retaliation if Assad cedes to the ""temptation"" of using chemical weapons in the looming battle for the northern Idlib province, the last major opposition stronghold.

Le Drian said Sunday on France-Inter radio that ""Assad won the war, we have to state this. But he hasn't won the peace.""

He said that even if Assad's forces retake Idlib, that won't solve the problems that unleashed the war seven years ago.

"An ex-Russian spy and his adult daughter were critically injured after they were poisoned by a nerve agent back in March — and now Russia is paying for the attack.

Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia were found unconscious March 4 on a bench in a shopping mall in Salisbury, about 90 miles west of London. The pair were released from the hospital two months later and moved to a private, secure location.

On Aug. 8, the U.S. announced it was imposing sanctions on Russia for using a chemical weapon in violation of international law, though the Kremlin repeatedly denied involvement. Following a 15-day congressional notification period, the sanctions took effect on or around Aug. 22, according to a statement from the State Department.

British Prime Minister Theresa May said days after the poisoning that it was “highly likely” Russia was responsible. And the U.S., Germany and France all appeared to back her.

2 RUSSIANS CHARGED OVER NOVICHOK POISONING OF EX-SPY, USED FAKE PERFUME BOTTLE, BRITISH OFFICIALS SAY

Since the March attack, a British couple with no ties to Russia have also been poisoned by the substance in Salisbury.

Dawn Sturgess, 44, died more than a week after authorities believe she was exposed to Novichok — the military-grade nerve agent also used in an attempt to assasinate Skripal. Charlie Rowley, 45, was also exposed to the agent and remains in critical but stable condition.

On Sept. 5, authorities in Britain charged two Russian men, identified as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, with the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter, as well as Sturgess.

The nerve agent used to poison the Skripals was smuggled to Britain in a counterfeit Nina Ricci perfume bottle and applied to the front door of their house, according to Metropolitan Police. Police believe the couple later found that same bottle, thus exposing them to the toxic nerve agent.



Here’s what we know about Skripal, and the incident that nearly killed him.

His background as a spy

Skripal served with Russia’s military intelligence, often known by its Russian-language acronym GRU, and retired in 1999. He then worked at the Foreign Ministry until 2003, and later became involved in business.

Skripal was arrested in 2004 in Moscow and later confessed to having been recruited by British intelligence in 1995. He also said at the time that he provided information about GRU agents in Europe, receiving over $100,000 in return.

WHAT'S THE GRU, RUSSIA'S MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AGENCY? 3 THINGS TO KNOW

At the time of Skripal’s trial, the Russian media quoted the FSB domestic security agency as saying that the damage from his activities could be compared to harm inflicted by Oleg Penkovsky, a GRU colonel who spied for the United States and Britain. Penkovsky was executed in 1963.

In 2006, Skripal was convicted on charges of spying for Britain and sentenced to 13 years. However, he later was pardoned and released from custody in July 2010 as part of a U.S.-Russian spy swap, which followed the exposure of a ring of Russian sleeper agents in the U.S.

Skripal’s wife and son have both died in recent years.

Prior to his wife’s death, however, she reportedly told police she feared for her husband’s life, the New York Daily News reported.

How world leaders responded to the attack

On March 15, world leaders said in a joint statement they ""abhor"" the attack against Skripal.

""It is an assault on U.K. sovereignty and any such use by a State party is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and a breach of international law. It threatens the security of us all,” the statement, signed by British Prime Minister Theresa May, President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, read.

The leaders called on Russia to ""live up to its responsibilities as a member of the UN Security Council to uphold international peace and security.""

May had given Russia until midnight on March 13 to respond to the charges. When Moscow failed to respond, May expelled 23 Russian diplomats from the U.K. They were given a week to pack their belongings and head back to Russia.

“This will be the single biggest expulsion for over 30 years and it will reflect the fact that this is not the first time the Russian state has acted against our country,"" May said at the time.

The U.S. also ordered 60 Russian diplomats to leave and announced it would close the Russian consulate in Seattle. In response, Russia then said it would expel 60 U.S. diplomats and close the U.S. consulate in St. Petersburg.

Two dozen countries, including the U.S., ordered more than 150 Russian diplomats out within a one-week span in a show of solidarity with the U.K.

How Russia reacted to the allegations

On March 18, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would cooperate with the U.K. in an investigation of the poisonings, calling them a ""tragedy."" However, Putin said if the claims they were poisoned by the Soviet-designed nerve agent were true, the victims would've died instantly.

""Russia does not have such [nerve] agents,"" Putin said, according to The Guardian. ""We destroyed all our chemical weapons under the supervision of international organizations and we did it first, unlike some of our partners who promised to do it, but unfortunately did not keep their promises.”

Putin added that he thought ""any sensible person would understand that it would be rubbish, drivel, nonsense, for Russia to embark on such an escapade on the eve of a presidential election.""

Putin's remarks came after Russia earlier retaliated against the U.K.: Moscow announced March 17 that it also would expel 23 British diplomats, among other diplomatic measures.

Franklin David was arrested last week in this impoverished town outside Caracas for doing what his family says he has done almost every day for the past 25 years: selling car parts.

In a surprise raid, about two dozen armed police officers flanked by Santa Teresa del Tuy's mayor and journalists showed up at David's four-story warehouse, Autopartes Guarico 2000, and hauled away the 49-year-old father of three for allegedly raising prices by too much in a country ravaged by hyperinflation.

His already-struggling business, built from scratch during a more prosperous era, was shut down and David remains jailed on charges of speculation, a crime punishable with up to 10 years in prison.

""It was like they were celebrating a triumph,"" said Julio Pernia, one of 20 employees who have no idea how they'll feed their families now that their boss is behind bars ""They treated us like killers but all we were doing was our work.""

David's plight is shared to some extent by thousands of small business owners nationwide — a few dozen who have been arrested and far more who fear having to choose between closing shop or hitting customers with steep price increases as they adapt to President Nicolas Maduro's sweeping plan to rescue the crisis-wracked economy.

The plan imposes a more-than-3,000 percent increase to the minimum wage while maintaining laws that threaten prison for storeowners who raise their prices in excess of what state regulators determine.

Even so — despite the heavy-handed crackdown that trapped businesses like David's — the reforms announced three weeks ago represent the most serious bow to market forces in two decades of socialist rule.

Developed in secret over several months with input from economic advisers to former Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, the plan consisted of some measures that Wall Street had been urging for years, like hiking give-away gas prices to close a yawning budget deficit and dismantling currency controls in place since 2003. Some opponents even accused Maduro of imposing a neoliberal blueprint — the ultimate insult in a country where hundreds were killed during days of looting the last time economic austerity was seriously attempted in 1989.

""We now have to play another way, with Prussian fiscal discipline to definitively eliminate the printing of non-organic money and sustain the creation of wealth through oil production, tourism and more-efficient collection of taxes,"" Maduro said in announcing the reforms. He also encouraged supporters to be vigilant against price-gouging and denounce merchants who raise prices ""excessively.""

But most economists view the plan as half-baked and ill-suited for a nation sitting atop the world's largest petroleum reserves. They argue that the minimum wage hike will bankrupt businesses and require the government to print bolivars with abandon, further stoking inflation forecast to reach 1 million percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.

In August, as a new currency with five fewer zeros was being rolled out, prices jumped a whopping 223 percent, according to a report by the opposition-controlled National Assembly. The central bank stopped regularly publishing inflation data in 2004.

""To dismantle this requires dismantling the clientele base of Chavismo with all the obstacles fueled by ideology, populism and corruption,"" said Orlando Ochoa, an Oxford University-trained economist who has been working the past two years with Venezuela's opposition on an economic transition plan. ""Asking Maduro to come up with a complex recovery plan is like asking him to undertake a human mission to Mars.""

But government backers blame U.S. financial sanctions and what Maduro calls an ""economic war"" by his opponents.

Pedro Paez, a former antitrust regulator in Ecuador, was among several officials linked to the leftist Correa as well as experts from Russia, China and multilateral banks who attended meetings in June with Vice President Tareck El Aissami to suggest ways out of Venezuela's economic mess.

He believes that Venezuela's biggest problem remains the price-setting power of its anti-government elite, which for years profited from access to the illegal currency markets and almost free public utilities even as inflation slashed the wages of the working class in dollar terms to the lowest level in Latin America.

""There's no increase in the cost structure that justifies such brutal increases in prices,"" said Paez.

But that's hardly comforting to small businesses.

Nationwide more than 130 merchants have been arrested since the measures were announced, according to the chief prosecutor's office. They include store managers of the nation's biggest pharmacy chain and at least two others — a Chinese grocer and a butcher — in Santa Teresa del Tuy.

Like many small business owners in Venezuela, the David family had become adroit at averting disaster. The business was started in 1991 by David's father, a mechanic who gradually built a chain of three stores. Over the years the family business survived riots, a banking crisis and more recently a shortage of imports that depleted inventories by half. The day David was arraigned was the 15th anniversary of his father's murder in a botched carjacking.

But David David, co-owner of the business, said that with his brother locked up, he doesn't know how he'll survive the potent mix of hyperinflation and ironclad controls.

For the first time, he's seriously considering permanently closing shop and joining the exodus of 2.3 million Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years. The only thing stopping him is the support of loyal employees he says are family and who this week took the unusual step of holding a small protest outside their shuttered workplace with signs that read ""Free Franklin"" and ""Let us work!""

According to a police report obtained by The Associated Press, a manager for the Miranda state government visited the shop on Aug. 27 and asked for the price of a small engine part for a Toyota Tacoma pick-up. When he returned a week later, the price had jumped almost five-fold, to 13,000 Bolivars, or about $210 at the new official exchange rate. As part of the reform package, Maduro devalued the official rate by 95 percent.

David David disputes the allegations in the complaint, but acknowledges that he had no choice to raise prices of his entire inventory by an average of 30 percent to absorb part of the higher costs for imports and now a 60-fold increase in wages. He says he didn't hike them more for fear it would've dried up the trickle of business he still has. In any case, auto parts have never been subject to price caps like food and medicine, leaving him to wonder what his apolitical family did to deserve such treatment.

""It's illogical to think that the government that should be helping you produce is instead the one that won't allow you to work,"" said David.

Mayor Ismael Capinel, a member of the ruling socialist party, didn't respond to a request for comment. At the run-down town hall building painted with several murals with the eyes of the late Hugo Chavez, a secretary said that Capinel doesn't have any set days or hours to show up at his office.

But when announcing the arrest, the mayor said he was fulfilling the will of Maduro and Miranda State Gov. Hector Rodriguez.

""This is a big defeat,"" he said while overseeing the raid, ""to those trying to destabilize the country.""

The new U.N. human rights chief on Monday announced plans to send teams to Italy and Austria to examine migrants' treatment, drawing a quick retort from Vienna.

Both countries' governments take a hard line on migration, and U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said that ""prioritizing the return of migrants from Europe, without ensuring that key international human rights obligations are upheld, cannot be considered a protection response.""

Bachelet said her office expects to dispatch a team to Austria to ""assess recent developments in this area."" She added that ""we also intend to send staff to Italy, to assess the reported sharp increase in acts of violence and racism against migrants, persons of African descent and Roma.""

She didn't say when either team would travel, or give other details in a written statement to the U.N. Human Rights Council, posted on her office's website , in which she also called on the European Union to set up a dedicated search and rescue operation for people crossing the Mediterranean Sea. She didn't mention sending teams to Austria and Italy in shorter oral remarks to the council in Geneva.

Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he welcomes Bachelet's announcement as offering an ""opportunity to rectify prejudices and deliberate false information about Austria,"" the Austria Press Agency reported.

Kurz said in a statement that ""living conditions for migrants"" in Austria are among the best in the world and added that Austria had taken in some of the highest numbers of migrants per capita in Europe.

""We hope that, after this examination, the U.N. will again have time and resources to dedicate to those countries where torture and the death penalty are on the agenda and the freedom of opinion, the press, assembly and religion are trampled on,"" Kurz said.

The conservative leader added that the check was ordered by a ""former socialist politician and member of the Socialist International."" Bachelet served two terms as Chile's president, the last of which ended earlier this year.",world
"The Chinese government is destroying crosses, burning bibles, closing churches and forcing Christian believers to sign papers renouncing their faith as the crackdown on religious congregations in Beijing and several provinces intensifies.

The suppression of religious freedoms is part of an official campaign to “Sinicize” religion by demanding loyalty to the atheist Communist party and removing any potential challenge to the party’s power in the country.

“The international community should be alarmed and outraged for this blatant violation of freedom of religion and belief,” Bob Fu of China Aid, said.

“The situation for Chinese #Christians becomes more dire by the day. We are working tirelessly to put maximum pressure on China stop the persecution,” Jay Sekulow, President Trump attorney and Chief Counsel at the American Center for Law & Justice (ACLJ), wrote in a tweet.

The persecution of Christians in China is nothing new. A report by the watchdog group Freedom House found that Christians and other religious groups in China have been persecuted since 2012, Fox News reported.

A third of all religious believers in China who belong to a faith group were also found to face “high” to “very high” levels of persecution, which ranges from bureaucratic harassment and economic exploitation to harsh prison terms and even violence, the report said.

But experts and activists say the Chinese government is now waging the most severe suppression of Christianity in the country since religious freedoms were granted by the Chinese constitution in 1982.

The escalating anti-Christian campaign coincides with President Xi Jinping recent consolidation of power that made him the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, the notorious communist leader responsible for millions of deaths.

Activists reportedly filmed footage of what appeared to be piles of burning bibles and forms declaring that the signatories had rejected their faith. The authorities allegedly forced the believers to sign the forms or risk being expelled from school or loosing welfare benefits.

A Christian Pastor in the Henan city of Nanyang, whose name was not identified out of fear of retaliation by the authorities, reportedly confirmed that crosses, bibles and furniture were burned during a raid on his church on Sept. 5.

He added that local authorities were in discussions with the church about reforming it, but no agreement had been reached.

According to Chinese laws, religious believers are allowed to worship only in government-sanctioned congregations. But many millions of Christians belong to underground or house churches that ignore government regulations.

Officials reportedly disputed the allegations raised by Christians, saying authorities respect religious freedom.

The anti-religion campaign affected not only Christian denominations. Around 1 million Uighurs and other members of Muslim minority groups in the country's northwest have been detained in indoctrination camps where they are forced to denounce Islam and profess loyalty to the Communist Party.

The Chinese government denied setting up the camps for indoctrination, but stressed the importance to tackle extremism.

China has an around 38 million Protestants, and some have predicted that the country will have the world's largest Christian population in a few decades.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said that Moscow ID'd the two men Britain accused in the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter, and he insisted that the two do not work for the military and urged them to come forward to talk to the media, the AP reported.

Britain said two men, whom they named last week as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, work for Russian military intelligence and are key suspects in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia in March.

But Putin said on Wednesday that he denied the two men worked for the military. He said Russian officials “know who these people are” and called on the two men to talk to the media and “tell about themselves.”

Skripal and his daughter were found unconscious March 4 on a bench in a shopping mall in Salisbury, about 90 miles west of London. The pair were released from the hospital two months later and moved to a private, secure location.

The nerve agent used to poison the Skripals was smuggled to Britain in a counterfeit Nina Ricci perfume bottle and applied to the front door of their house, according to Metropolitan Police.

Since the March attack, a British couple with no ties to Russia have also been poisoned by the substance in Salisbury.

Police believe Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner, 45-year-old Charlie Rowley, later found that same bottle, thus exposing them to the toxic nerve agent. Sturgess died more than a week later, while Rowley remains in critical but stable condition.

After the Skripals were poisoned, Britain and more than two dozen other countries expelled a total of 150 Russian spies working under diplomatic cover. Russia kicked out a similar number of those countries' envoys.

On Aug. 8, the U.S. announced it was imposing sanctions on Russia for using a chemical weapon in violation of international law, though the Kremlin repeatedly denied involvement. Following a 15-day congressional notification period, the sanctions took effect on or around Aug. 22, according to a statement from the State Department.

"Security forces have launched a search operation to determine the source of three mortar shells that landed inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, following a night of violent confrontations between protesters and security forces in the country's south in which three people were shot dead.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the mortar shells that landed just after midnight Friday in an abandoned lot in the Green Zone, and no casualties were reported.

The rare attack comes amid a political crisis and worsening protests against poor services and unemployment in the southern city of Basra, which have turned violent in the past few days.

Hundreds of angry protesters in Basra took to the streets on Thursday night. Some clashed with security forces, lobbing Molotov cocktails and setting fire to a government building as well as the offices of Shiite militias. At least three people were shot dead in confrontations with security forces.

Residents of Basra and other cities in Iraq's oil-rich southern Shiite heartland have been protesting since July over endemic corruption, soaring joblessness and poor public services. Clashes erupted earlier this week, leaving several civilians and police dead. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has ordered an investigation into the violence which shows no sign of abating.

The violence prompted the temporary head of Iraq's parliament, the eldest lawmaker, to call an emergency meeting on Saturday to discuss the snowballing protests.

The newly-elected parliament earlier this week held its first session since the national elections in May. The session was adjourned amid disagreements as two blocs, both claiming to hold the most seats, vied for the right to form a new government.

The new parliament faces the twin tasks of rebuilding the north of the country following the war against the Islamic State group and rehabilitating services in the south, where severe water and electricity shortages have fueled protests.

A coalition led by al-Abadi and populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has the support of the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, while an alliance between former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and militia leader Hadi al-Amiri has the backing of Iran.

Both alliances are dominated by Shiites, who have held the preponderance of power in Iraq since Saddam Hussein's ouster in 2003. But the largest Sunni blocs are aligned with al-Abadi and al-Sadr. Iraq's two main Kurdish parties have not taken a side.

A representative of the Shiite community's spiritual leader, the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, condemned during the Friday prayers sermon the violence against peaceful protesters and called for the quick formation of a new government that can deal with the challenges facing the country.",world
"U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley echoed recent White House statements and again warned Syria and its allies Russia and Iran that the U.S. will act again if chemical weapons are used against Syrian civilians. Haley was addressing a United Nations Security Council meeting on chemical weapons use in Syria Thursday afternoon.

Haley made the Trump administration’s intentions clear telling the Security Council that: “We have a message for the Assad regime, and anyone contemplating using chemical weapons in Syria … we want to take this opportunity to remind (President Bashar al-Assad) and his Russian and Iranian partners: You don’t want to bet against the United States responding again.”

The U.S. and its allies responded twice before against the Assad regime for its use of chemical weapons, once in 2017 and earlier this year.

Haley called on Russia to stop the Assad regime’s current offensive plans in Idlib in Syria’s northwest province. It’s estimated that up to three million civilians are at risk, many of them having fled previous fighting in the last rebel stronghold.

“Today’s Security Council session is devoted to chemical weapons — but make no mistake, an Assad regime offensive on Idlib would be a reckless escalation even if chemical weapons were not used. It is up to Russia to keep this from happening,” she said.

Haley said that according to U.S. estimates Assad had used chemical weapons on its own people some 50 times, leading to 1,500 hundred deaths including women and children in Syria’s seven-year war. “Fifteen-hundred murders covered up by the Russian regime. And 1,500 reasons to disbelieve the claims that others are responsible for these atrocities.”

Earlier in the meeting, Russian U.N. ambassador Vassily Nebenzia complained about what he called “the anti-Damascus stance,” adopted by the Western countries on the council.

Nebenzia said, “Damascus does not have chemical weapons and nor does it have plans to use it.” He then echoed a recent Russian talking point that claimed that Syrian rebels were planning a chemical attack with the intent of blaming it on the Syrian regime to provoke a military response from Western countries.

Great Britain’s Ambassador Karen Pierce joined with Haley and other members of the council in calling for the Russians to ensure chemical weapons are not used against the civilian population: “Either Russia calls for restraint or Russia will be deemed complicit in their use when these weapons are used.”

Pierce responded to the Russian ambassador’s earlier use of an Agatha Christie novel to prove his point.

“Turning to the risk of the use of chemical weapons over Idlib, and taking account of what the Russian representative said: ‘Agatha Christie is a fiction writer.’ What's fact … is that the Syrian authorities have been found to have used chemical weapons against their own people.”

Pierce continued, “So what we hear from the Russian ambassador is an inversion of the facts; an inversion of the concern for protection of civilians that this Council has mandated; an inversion of what the rules-based international order of multilateralism is all about; and fundamentally, an inversion of what governments are supposed to do, which is their first duty — is to protect their people and to keep their people safe.”

Syria’s U.N. Ambassador Bashar Jaafari, while not a member of the Security Council, spoke at length claiming, among other things, that his country had not used chemical weapons, and echoed Russian talking points bizarrely accusing the U.S., Great Britain and France of being involved in prohibitive acts in Syria, by supporting terrorist groups in his war-torn nation.

On Friday, the Security Council meets again on Syria. This time, members will discuss the humanitarian and political situations in Syria with a special focus on Idlib.

The Trump administration also Thursday played down talk of an imminent pullout of American forces from Syria, while simultaneously demanding a complete withdrawal of Iranian forces from Syrian territory.

U.S. special representative for Syria James Jeffrey, speaking to reporters Thursday about U.S. policy toward the war-torn nation, is pledging the “U.S. will remain in Syria” until the “enduring defeat” of the Islamic State group.

There are roughly 2,000 U.S. troops deployed there.

Trump previously has expressed a desire to get the U.S. out of Syria.

Continually during the Trump administration, America’s foreign policy is trying to roll back the U.S.’ role as a global policeman.

"Photos of a female hunter from Kentucky proudly showing off the results of her “dream hunt” – a dead black giraffe in South Africa – have ignited a firestorm across social media after being picked up by a local African media outlet.

“White American savage who is partly a Neanderthal comes to Africa and shoot down a very rare black giraffe courtesy of South Africa stupidity,” read the June 2018 tweet, posted by Africa Digest. “Her name is Tess Thompson Talley. Please share.”

The controversial images, which were posted by a Kentucky woman identified as Tess Thompson Talley a year ago, show her standing proudly beside a dead giraffe bull along with the caption: “Prayers for my once in a lifetime dream hunt came true today! Spotted this rare black giraffe bull and stalked him for quite a while. I knew it was the one. He was over 18 years old, 4000 lbs. and was blessed to be able to get 2000 lbs. of meat from him.”

Trophy hunting is a legal practice in a number of African countries, including South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

“The giraffe I hunted was the South African sub-species of giraffe. The numbers of this sub-species is actually increasing due, in part, to hunters and conservation efforts paid for in large part by big game hunting. The breed is not rare in any way other than it was very old. Giraffes get darker with age,” said Talley, in an email to Fox News.

She points out that the giraffe she killed was 18, too old to breed, and had killed three younger bulls who were able to breed, causing the herd’s population to decrease. Now, with the older giraffe dead, the younger bulls are able to continue to breed and can increase the population.

“This is called conservation through game management,” says Talley, who insists hers was not a “canned” hunt.

Prominent activist and Hollywood actor Ricky Gervais, on the same day Talley’s images went viral, tweeted that “Giraffes are now on the 'red list' of endangerment due to a 40% decline over the last 25 years. They could become extinct. Gone forever. And still, we allow spoilt c--ts to pay money to shoot them with a bow and arrow for fun.”

However, there is some debate of the “rarity” of the giraffe on Talley’s hit list.

“The giraffe in the photo is of the South African species Giraffa giraffe, which are not rare – they are increasing in the wild,” Julian Fennessy, Ph.D., co-founder of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation told Yahoo Lifestyle. “Legal hunting of giraffe is not a reason for their decline, despite the moral and ethical side of it which is a different story.”

Nonetheless, the images have spurred deep emotions among those opposed to the controversial practice.

“Shame on you to think your life is more than any other living creature and gives you the right to end its life! Who are you to place yourself above any other living creature,” one person tweeted. “I hope nature takes revenge on you!”

Others have vowed that “killing animals for fun is a sign of serious mental illness,” while others have referred to Talley as a “disgusting excuse for a human being” and a “spoiled wealthy brat with no conscience.” She was also referred to as a “disgusting, vile, amoral, heartless, selfish murderer” by actress Debra Messing.

However, the self-described passionate hunter is hardly the first American to come under intense Internet fire in recent times for overseas trophy kills.

Nikki Tate, a 27-year-old lawyer and “ethical hunter” from Texas sparked outcry – and death threats – late last year after she posted pictures with her kills. But she also attested to receiving scores of messages of support too, being referred to as a “role model and inspiration” in the conservation arena.

And in 2015, Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer was internationally scorned after killing the famous “Cecile the Lion” near a national park in Zimbabwe.

""I get that hunting is not for everyone; that’s what makes this world great is the differences. But to make threats to anyone because they don’t believe the way you do is completely unacceptable. If it was any other belief that was different, threats and insults would be deemed hideous. However, for some reason it is OK to act this way because it’s hunting,"" Talley wrote in her email.

Meanwhile, in the United States, the issue of trophy hunting abroad remains a controversial one legislatively as conservation and welfare groups are banding together to encourage the Trump administration to reject import permits for South African lions.

Under a new process instituted in March this year, trophy hunters are able to provide the U.S government with information confidentially rather than giving public notice in their quest to obtain an import permit, raising questions over the legalities how the kill was carried out, and whether or not mostly illicit practices such as “baiting” were used, violating the ethics of “fair chase.”

Big-game hunters appointed by the Trump team to assist in the re-writing of federal rules pertaining to the importing of heads from African elephants and lions last week defended the trophy hunting practice, contending that threatened and endangered species would go extinct without the anti-poaching programs financed in large part by the hefty fees wealthy Americans pay to carry out the souvenir slaughters.

Where the president himself now stands on the matter, however, remains unclear.

“Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal,” he tweeted in November.",world

At least four people have been killed as the Syrian government and Russian warplanes targeted the southern edge of Idlib province with an intense wave of airstrikes and shelling on Saturday, activists and a war monitoring group said.

Those killed include two children and a woman, most of them in Abdeen.

The intense air raids came a day after Iran and Russia backed a military campaign in the rebel-held area despite Turkey's pleas for a cease-fire. Turkey has troops and 12 observations points that ring Idlib.

State-run Al-Ikhbariya TV said the government was retaliating against overnight shelling from rebel-held areas on a government-held town in Hama province, south of Idlib. The shelling late Friday in Mhradah killed nine civilians, according to state media.

But the government and Russian raids targeted a wide swath of rebel-held area in the southern edge of the rebel-held enclave that includes most of Idlib province and northern Hama province.

On Saturday, the spokesman for the Turkish president criticized world players for their lack of action to stop a looming offensive against the last remaining rebel stronghold in northwestern Syria.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported more than 68 air raids in the southwestern Idlib town of Khan Sheikhoun, and other villages and towns in the province and in northern Hama.

US MARINES LAUNCH LIVE-FIRE AIR ASSAULT INTO SYRIA DESERT IN 'STRONG MESSAGE' TO RUSSIA

The intense raids forced schools to close in Khan Sheikhoun, an area under attack, according to the Observatory.

The local council of Morek, a town that serves as a crossing between Hama and Idlib, sent an urgent appeal, asking Turkey for a quick solution. ""We need a quick solution or our town will burn!"" the official pleaded in an audio recording shared on social media groups.

Separately, clashes broke out in eastern Syria in Qamishli, a town close to the border with Turkey, between government and Kurdish security members. The Observatory said the clashes left 10 government security personnel and seven Kurdish fighters dead.

The town is run by Kurdish-led administrators and forces, but Syrian government troops hold pockets of territory there, including the airport. Clashes rarely erupt there over turf control and authority and are usually a reflection of deepening political tension between the uneasy partners.

Kurdish security forces, known as Asayish, said in a statement that a government patrol entered the areas controlled by the Kurdish militia in Qamishli and began arresting civilians, then shot at a Kurdish checkpoint sparking the gun battle. The Asayish said seven of its members and 11 government personnel were killed.

TRUMP REPORTEDLY APPROVES NEW OBJECTIVES IN SYRIA, KEEPING MILITARY PRESENCE INDEFINITELY

A journalist and resident of the area, Arin Sheikmos, said the government security troops went on an arrest campaign in Kurdish-controlled areas, detaining people it accuses of skipping compulsory military service. This prompted the clashes, which lasted no more than 20 minutes, Sheikmos said.

There was no immediate word about the clashes from the government.

The U.S-backed Kurdish administration has recently begun talking with the Syrian government — essentially seeking government recognition of its self-rule areas. But in recent days, the Damascus government announced it is holding local administration elections, including in Kurdish-ruled areas, undermining the negotiations and talk of Kurdish self-rule.

"A 13-year-old Alabama girl with special needs was beheaded last month after watching her grandmother be fatally stabbed in a cemetery, an investigator testified Thursday.

The details emerged in a Madison County court during a preliminary hearing for Yoni Aguilar, 26, AL.com reported.

Aguilar and Israel Palomino, 34, are charged with two counts each of capital murder in the June slayings of Oralia Mendoza, 49, and her granddaughter, Mariah Lopez.

Authorities said Mendoza was associated with the Sinaloa cartel, one of the world’s most powerful drug-trafficking organizations.

Aguilar told investigators that he, Mendoza, Palomino, and another woman traveled to Georgia in early June to pick up a kilo of methamphetamine.

The arrangement reportedly turned awry when Palomino became suspicious of Mendoza and the other woman because of their cartel connections, FOX 25 News reported, citing Aguilar’s testimony.

Aguilar, who was Mendoza’s live-in boyfriend, said he thought he was being set up.

A couple of days later, Palomino and Aguilar picked up Mendoza and her granddaughter from Mendoza’s house, saying they would take them “somewhere safe,” AL.com reported.

The men reportedly drove Mendoza and her granddaughter to a cemetery and Mendoza was fatally stabbed following an argument over the drug buy.

Aguilar told investigators that Palomino then forced him to kill the girl in a secluded area because she was a witness, police said.

"Pope Francis said Wednesday he hopes to visit Japan next year, a trip that would enable him to draw attention to both the legacy of Christian martyrs centuries ago and survivors of the atomic bombs in 1945.

Francis made the announcement while meeting with members of a visiting Japanese cultural association.

""Taking advantage of this visit, I want to announce my hope to visit Japan next year. We hope to do it,"" Francis said, speaking off-the-cuff.

Francis has long expressed his admiration for Japanese culture and history, and famously had hoped to become a missionary in Japan after he was ordained a priest. His superiors dashed his hopes, however, citing his frail health at the time.

But during his five-year papacy he has repeatedly spoken in admiration of the missionary work of his Jesuit order to bring Christianity to Japan in the 16th century, and of the witness of the martyrs who suffered from the anti-Christian persecution that ensued.

Any papal visit to Japan would certainly include a visit to the Museum of the 26 Martyrs and monument in Nagasaki at the site where 26 Christians were killed in 1597.

Visiting Nagasaki would also allow Francis to draw attention to its devastating atomic legacy; Francis has called for a world completely free of nuclear weapons and earlier this year had the Vatican print up thousands of cards purportedly of a Nagasaki child survivor carrying his dead brother on his back with the words ""the fruit of war"" printed on it.

Earlier this year, the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reportedly asked Francis to visit to encourage survivors. And Japan's bishops have been urging him to visit since he was elected, in part to honor the so-called ""Hidden Christians"" who kept the faith alive during decades of persecution.

Jesuit missionaries first began spreading Christianity in Japan in 1549, famously led by St. Francis Xavier, one of the founders of Francis' Jesuit order. By 1585 Christianity had spread so much that a delegation of four young Japanese Catholics traveled halfway around the globe to participate in the festivities of the election of Pope Sixtus V in Rome.

But a backlash against Christians was already brewing and persecution became rampant and systematic, with Christians executed en masse, including the famous 26 martyrs. In 1612, a famous anti-Christian edict was passed and a few years later Christianity was banned outright.

Today, Japan has a tiny Catholic community; Francis has praised its strong faith as a result of the history of brutal Christian persecution.

"Israeli warplanes struck dozens of targets in the Gaza Strip and three people were reported killed there, while Palestinian militants from the territory fired scores of rockets into Israel in a fierce burst of violence overnight and into Thursday morning.

The flare-up comes as Egypt is trying to broker a long-term cease-fire between the two sides. At least three Palestinians died — a pregnant woman, her 1-year-old daughter and a Hamas militant, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

On the Israeli side, at least seven people were wounded.

It was not clear if the escalation, the latest in a series of intense exchanges of fire in recent months, would derail the indirect negotiations between Israel and Gaza's Hamas militant rulers.

Air raid sirens signaling incoming rocket fire continued in southern Israel on Thursday morning, raising the likelihood of further Israeli reprisals.

Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza in 2007. Despite the animosity, the bitter enemies appear to be working through Egyptian mediators to avoid another war.

Hamas is demanding the lifting of an Israeli-Egyptian border blockade that has devastated Gaza's economy, while Israel wants an end to rocket fire, as well as recent border protests and launches of incendiary balloons, and the return of the remains of two dead soldiers and two live Israelis believed to be held by Hamas.

But the continued outbursts of fire have jeopardized those cease-fire efforts. On Tuesday, the Israeli military struck a Hamas military post in Gaza after it said militants fired on Israeli troops on the border. Hamas said two of its fighters were killed after taking part in a gunfire parade inside a militant camp.

The incident occurred while a group of senior Hamas leaders from abroad were visiting Gaza to discuss the ceases-fire efforts with local leaders.

A top Hamas official told The Associated Press that the group waited for the delegation to leave Gaza before responding with rocket fire late Wednesday.

The Israeli military said over 150 rockets and mortars were fired at Israel, and Israel carried out over 140 airstrikes targeting Hamas militant positions.

Gaza's Health Ministry identified those killed in the airstrikes from Wednesday to Thursday as Hamas fighter Ali Ghandour, 23-year-old Enas Khamash and her daughter Bayan. The ministry said the militant and the civilians were killed in separate incidents.

Israeli army spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus insisted Israel only targeted Hamas military targets in Gaza.

In southern Israel, two Thai laborers were among the seven wounded by rocket fire, and rockets damaged buildings in the cities of Sderot and Ashkelon. The military said it intercepted some 25 rockets, while most of the others landed in open areas. Israel said it launched airstrikes targeting rocket launchers, weapons stockpiles, tunnels and other Hamas infrastructure.

Israeli Cabinet minister for construction and housing, Yoav Galant, said that ""whatever is needed to be done to defend our civilians and soldiers, will be done, no matter what would be the price in Gaza.""

Conricus wouldn't comment on Israeli media reports of troops preparing for a possible ground operation, but said Israel ""had ground troops that are ready to deploy. We are reinforcing the southern command and Gaza division.""

On Wednesday, the Israeli military shelled the Palestinian territory after civilians working on the Gaza border fence came under fire. Hamas militants responded with a cross-border fusillade that sent Israelis scrambling for air raid shelters.

The Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing classified negotiations, said that cease-fire talks were in their final stage but that disagreements remained. He said Hamas is demanding the complete lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade, while Israel has offered only to ease the restrictions.

Tension along the Israel-Gaza border has escalated since late March, when Hamas launched what would become regular mass protests along Israel's perimeter fence with Gaza. The protests have been aimed in part at trying to break the blockade.

Over the past four months, 163 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, including at least 120 protesters, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and a local rights group. An Israeli soldier was killed by a Gaza sniper during this period.

Israel says it has been defending its sovereign border against infiltration attempts by Hamas. But it has come under heavy international criticism for its frequent use of force against unarmed protesters.",world

The Latest on Syria talks in Iran (all times local):

9:40 p.m.

Syrian pro-government media reported that nine civilians have been killed by shells fired from rebel areas south of the province of Idlib on a government-held town.

Syria state news agency SANA said they were killed when the missiles struck into a residential area in Mhardeh town in the northern countryside of Hama. Hama lies to the south of Idlib, and several of its villages and towns remain under rebel control.

Warplanes, including suspected Russian ones, hit rebel areas in northern and southern Idlib earlier Friday, killing at least five, including one civilian, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The violence comes on the day that the presidents of Iran, Turkey and Russia are meeting to discuss the fate of the last rebel stronghold in Idlib and surrounding areas in Hama.

The director of U.N. humanitarian operations is warning that if a military offensive takes place in Idlib and millions of people start fleeing, aid operations to help them will be overwhelmed.

John Ging told the U.N. Security Council on Friday this worst-case scenario ""has the potential to create a humanitarian emergency at a scale not yet seen through this crisis,"" now in its eighth year.

He urged council members to ask the parties to cease hostilities in the Idlib de-escalation zone which includes parts of Idlib, Aleppo, Latakia and Hama governorates and includes some 3 million people, about 2.1 million already in need of humanitarian aid.

Ging also called for protection of civilians, humanitarian and medical personnel, hospitals, schools and other infrastructure as well as freedom for people to move, access for aid deliveries, and increased funding.

While donors including Britain and Germany have recently provided resources, he said, the U.N. is still ""woefully short of the $311 million that we estimate is required if there is an increase in violence resulting in mass displacement.""

Ging said humanitarian aid is being prepositioned inside Idlib and in surrounding areas, and ""plans are in place to support up to 900,000 women, children and men that could be affected by conflict.""

He warned that if millions of people flee Idlib, however, it ""will overwhelm all capacity to respond regardless of plans or funding made available.""

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday after a trilateral meeting between Iran, Russia and Turkey to discuss the war in Syria.

In the Friday report carried by the leader's website, Khamenei.ir, he said that the United States is worried about the formation of an ""Islamic authority.""

""America is concerned about the cooperation of Islamic countries and the formation of an Islamic authority,"" Khamenei was quoted as saying.

The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. is warning Syria and its allies Russia and Iran that ""the consequences will be dire"" for an assault on the last major stronghold for Syrian rebels in Idlib.

Nikki Haley told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that an offensive against Idlib is starting despite warnings from President Donald Trump and other world leaders, including Russian and Syrian airstrikes against civilian areas.

""The United States has been very clear, with Russia and with the broader international community: we consider any assault on Idlib to be a dangerous escalation of the conflict in Syria,"" Haley said.

""If (Syrian President Bashar) Assad, Russia, and Iran continue, the consequences will be dire,"" she said.

Haley said Syria must halt its offensive, and Russia and Iran have the power to prevent ""this catastrophe.""

8:05 p.m.

Eight aid agencies have called on world leaders to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Syria's northwestern Idlib province, where the Syrian government is threatening a military offensive.

The agencies called on leaders of the Iran, Russia and Turkey meeting in Tehran and members of the U.N. Security Council meeting later in New York to work together to find a diplomatic solution that can protect civilians, aid workers and allow access to humanitarian agencies to the overcrowded province and surrounding areas.

More than 3 million live in Idlib and its environs, many of them already displaced by conflict elsewhere in Syria.

The agencies, including CARE, Mercy Corps and the International Rescue Committee, said the ""most vulnerable"" are likely to pay the heaviest price in case of an offensive. They said aid workers working in Idlib are already overwhelmed trying to provide basic needs and shelter to the province's population, which has doubled in size in recent months because it is hosting displaced citizens from all over Syria.

7:50 p.m.

The U.N. envoy for Syria says any proposal to avoid Idlib becoming ""the biggest humanitarian tragedy at the end of the most horrible recent conflict in our memory"" must be given a chance — and he has some ideas on how to separate ""terrorists"" from civilians.

Staffan De Mistura is also calling for ""protected voluntary evacuation routes"" for civilians if they want to leave Idlib.

He told the U.N. Security Council Friday that talk of a military offensive on Idlib ""is happening at exactly the same time when there is serious talk"" on moving to establish a committee to draft a new Syrian constitution and encourage the return of Syrian refugees.

De Mistura said these are incompatible.

""Either we are trying to find a political way to end this war and move to a post-war political scenario or we will see this war reach new levels of horrors.""

He said that's why Friday's meeting of the leaders of Russia, Iran and Turkey in Tehran is so important and why he will be meeting with the three countries in Geneva on Monday and Tuesday — and next Friday with Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Britain and the United States.

It would be a failure of diplomacy ""if with these efforts we simply saw an increase of military activities,"" De Mistura said.

Turkey's president says his country does not have the ""strength or capability"" to host millions of more refugees from Idlib.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that a call for terror groups in Idlib to lay down arms was a strong message to them and would help halt refugee flows.

""We have to take joint steps to prevent the migration, we need to be successful in the fight against terrorism,"" Erdogan said.

""Turkey is already sheltering 3 ½ million refugees (from Syria). The population of Idlib is 3 ½ million. Turkey doesn't have the strength or capability to host 3 ½ million more,"" he added.

"America's long-running reluctant relationship with the International Criminal Court came to a crashing halt as decades of U.S. suspicions about the tribunal and its global jurisdiction spilled into open hostility, amid threats of sanctions if it investigates U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

National security adviser John Bolton on Monday denounced the legitimacy of The Hague-based court, which was created in 2002 to prosecute war crimes and crimes of humanity and genocide in areas where perpetrators might not otherwise face justice. The court has 123 state parties that recognize its jurisdiction.

Bolton's speech, on the eve of the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attack, came as an ICC judge was expected to soon announce a decision on a request from prosecutors to formally open an investigation into allegations of war crimes committed by Afghan national security forces, Taliban and Haqqani network militants and U.S. forces and intelligence in Afghanistan since May 2003. The accusations against U.S. personnel include torture and illegal imprisonment.

""The International Criminal Court unacceptably threatens American sovereignty and U.S. national security interests,"" Bolton told the Federalist Society, a conservative Washington-based think tank.

Bolton also took aim at Palestinian efforts to press war crime charges against Israel for its policies in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza.

He said the U.S. would use ""any means necessary"" to protect Americans and citizens of allied countries, like Israel, ""from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court."" The White House said that to the extent permitted by U.S. law, the Trump administration would ban ICC judges and prosecutors from entering the United States, sanction their funds in the U.S. financial system and prosecute them in the U.S. criminal system.

""We will not cooperate with the ICC,"" Bolton said, adding that ""for all intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead to us.""

In response, the court issued a statement Tuesday saying it was ""an independent and impartial judicial institution"" created to ""ensure accountability for crimes that shock the conscience of humanity.""

The court said it prosecuted cases only when those states fail to do so or did not do so ""genuinely.""

It pledged to ""continue to do its work undeterred, in accordance with those principles and the overarching idea of the rule of law.""

Bolton's speech was an extraordinary rebuke decried by human rights groups that complained it was another Trump administration rollback of U.S. leadership in demanding accountability for gross abuses.

""Any U.S. action to scuttle ICC inquiries on Afghanistan and Palestine would demonstrate that the administration was more concerned with coddling serial rights abusers — and deflecting scrutiny of U.S. conduct in Afghanistan — than supporting impartial justice,"" said Human Rights Watch.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents several people who claim they were detained and tortured in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2008 and could be victims or witnesses in any ICC prosecution, said Bolton's threats were ""straight out of an authoritarian playbook.""

""This misguided and harmful policy will only further isolate the United States from its closest allies and give solace to war criminals and authoritarian regimes seeking to evade international accountability,"" the ACLU said.

Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, slammed the U.S. opposition on Tuesday.

""The U.S. threatens to impose sanctions on the ICC & even prosecute its judges in American courts. Where is the outrage?"" he wrote on his Twitter account. ""The boorishness of this rogue US regime seems to know no bounds. When will the international community say enough is enough & force US to act like a normal state?""

Since its creation, the court has filed charges against dozens of suspects including former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed by rebels before he could be arrested, and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who is accused of charges including genocide in Darfur. Al-Bashir remains at large, as does Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony, who was among the first rebels charged by the court in 2005. The court has convicted just eight defendants.

The court has been hobbled by the refusal of the U.S., Russia, China and other major nations to join. Others have quit: Burundi and the Philippines, whose departure, announced earlier this year, takes effect next March.

The Clinton administration in 2000 signed the Rome Statute that created the ICC but had serious reservations about the scope of the court's jurisdiction and never submitted it for ratification to the Senate, where there was broad bipartisan opposition to what lawmakers saw as a threat to U.S. sovereignty.

When George W. Bush took office in 2001, his administration promoted and passed the American Service Members Protection Act, which sought to immunize U.S. troops from potential prosecution by the ICC. In 2002, Bolton, then a State Department official, traveled to New York to ceremonially ""unsign"" the Rome Statute at the United Nations.

Bush's first administration then embarked on a diplomatic drive to get countries who were members of the ICC to sign so-called Article 98 agreements that would bar those nations from prosecuting Americans before the court under penalty of sanctions. The administration was largely successful in its effort, getting more than 100 countries to sign the agreements. Some of those, however, have not been formally ratified.

In Bush's second term, the U.S. attitude toward the ICC shifted slightly as the world looked on in horror at genocide being committed in Sudan's western Darfur region. The administration did not oppose and offered limited assistance to an ICC investigation in Darfur.

The Obama administration expanded that cooperation, offering additional support to the ICC as it investigated the then-Uganda-based Lord's Resistance Army and its top leadership, including Kony.

On Monday, Bolton effectively turned Washington's back on the court, accusing it of corruption and inefficiency. Above all, he took aim at the court's view that citizens of nonmember states are subject to its jurisdiction.

""The ICC is an unprecedented effort to vest power in a supranational body without the consent of either nation-states or the individuals over which it purports to exercise jurisdiction,"" Bolton said. ""It certainly has no consent whatsoever from the United States.""

A 2006 letter from a top Vatican official confirms that the Holy See received information in 2000 about the sexual misconduct of now-resigned U.S. cardinal, lending credibility to bombshell accusations of a cover-up at the highest echelons of the Roman Catholic Church.

Catholic News Service, the news agency of the U.S. bishops' conference, published the letter Friday from then-Archbishop Leonardo Sandri to the Rev. Boniface Ramsay, a New York priest who made the initial allegation.

Ramsay informed the Vatican in a November 2000 letter about then Cardinal Theodore McCarrick's misconduct with seminarians from Seton Hall University's Immaculate Conception Seminary. Ramsay, who in 2000 was on the faculty at the seminary, has said he sent the letter at the request of the then-Vatican ambassador because he had heard so many complaints from seminarians that McCarrick would invite them to his beach house and into his bed.

Sandri, now a top-ranked Vatican cardinal who was the No. 3 in the Vatican's secretariat of state at the time, wrote Ramsay on Oct. 11, 2006, seeking his recommendation for a former seminarian for a Vatican job.

In it, he referred to Ramsay's 2000 letter, saying: ""I ask with particular reference to the serious matters involving some of the students of the Immaculate Conception Seminary, which in November 2000 you were good enough to bring confidentially to the attention of the then-Apostolic Nuncio in the United States, the late Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo.""

Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, at the center of a storm rocking Pope Francis' papacy, cited Ramsay's 2000 letter in his own expose of a cover-up about the McCarrick affair. He named Sandri among a long list of Vatican officials who knew about McCarrick's penchant for seminarians. Vigano also accused Francis of knowing in 2013 of McCarrick's misconduct but of rehabilitating him from sanctions purportedly imposed by Pope Benedict XVI.

Sandri's letter is significant because it corroborates Ramsay's story as well as Vigano's claims. It shows the Vatican knew about allegations against McCarrick in 2000, a year before St. John Paul II made him a cardinal. And it further implicates the Benedict's papacy for failing to take action against McCarrick for years even as more allegations against him arrived.

Vigano says Benedict eventually imposed some form of sanction on McCarrick in 2009 or 2010, nearly a decade after Ramsay's letter arrived. The fact that Sandri cited it so readily suggests it wasn't lost in a pile of unread mail somewhere, but was relevant even for a simple job reference.

Significantly, Sandri appeared more concerned about the sexual purity of the seminarian-candidate than that McCarrick might have sexually abused or harassed him, or abused his power over him.

McCarrick resigned as a cardinal in July after a U.S. church investigation determined an accusation that he groped a teen-age altar boy in the 1970s was credible. Since then several seminarians have come forward to say he routinely bedded them, or harassed them when they refused.

His lawyer has said the accusations are serious and that McCarrick looks forward to invoking his right to due process at the right time.",world
"Dutch prosecutors on Monday announced that the 19-year-old Afghan citizen accused of stabbing two American tourists may have done so because he believes Islam is insulted in the Netherlands.

The announcement came after officials said there was a “terrorist motive” behind the attack.

The suspect, identified only as Jawed S., allegedly stabbed the two Americans at Amsterdam’s Central Station just after noon on Friday. His reasoning for targeting the victims was not based on their nationality, prosecutors said. Rather, the suspect's grievance was with the European country where the assault took place, they said in a written statement.

""It is apparent from his statements that he believes that in the Netherlands, the Prophet Muhammad, the Quran, Islam and Allah are repeatedly insulted,"" prosecutors said, noting that the Afghan man specifically mentioned Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders, who is known for his fierce anti-Islam rhetoric.

""From the suspect's statements so far, it is clear the man had a terrorist motive ... and that he traveled to the Netherlands for that reason,"" the prosecutors said.

The Americans suffered serious but non life-threatening injuries. Prosecutors said they did not believe the suspect was working with anyone else.



Wilders last week called off a planned contest for cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad following death threats and concerns other people could be put at risk. Prosecutors said the suspect did not mention the contest in his statements.

DUTCH LAWMAKER CANCELS PROPHET MUHAMMAD CARTOON CONTEST

Wilders reacted with a tweet, writing: ""Muslim terrorists hate our way of life and our freedoms. They answer criticism of Islam with violence.""

The suspect, who was shot after the stabbings and was recovering from his injuries in a hospital, had applied for asylum in Germany and was not considered a security threat there, German officials said Monday.

An investigating judge extended the suspect's custody because of fears he may escape the region, repeat the crime or otherwise break the law, according to a statement by an Amsterdam court.

Palestinian postal workers in the West Bank are sifting through eight years' worth of undelivered mail held by Israel.

In recent days the Palestinian postal staff in Jericho has been sorting through tons of undelivered mail in a room packed with letters, boxes and even a wheelchair.

The Palestinians say Israel has withheld delivery of post shipments to the Palestinian territories through its national postal service since 2010. According to Palestinian postage official Ramadan Ghazawi, Israel did not honor a 2008 agreement with the Palestinians to send and receive mail directly through Jordan. Mail was indeed delivered through Jordan but was denied entry by Israel, causing a years-long backlog.

""It was blocked because each time they (Israel) used to give us a reason and an excuse. Once they said the terminal, the building that the post was supposed to arrive to is not ready and once (they said) to wait, they're expecting a larger checking machine (security scanner),"" he said.

Israel says the sides came to an understanding about a year ago on postage delivery but that it has not yet resulted in a ""direct transfer,"" according to Cogat, the Israeli defense body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs in the West Bank.

Cogat said in a statement that the one-time release of the ten and a half tons of mail was a ""gesture.""

Jericho resident Rami Baker said ordering goods by mail has been a challenge.

""The problem that I suffer from is that the mail is very delayed. For example you order something and the website will tell you it will arrive within 20 to 30 days and after 30 days you get a note that it reached Jerusalem or Israel. After that, a day or two later, we come and check with the Palestinian post office here in Jericho and they say we did not receive it yet from the Israeli side and this thing takes months,"" he said.

The development highlights the tight controls Israel maintains over many aspects — even the mundane like postal delivery — of Palestinian life.",world

Scientists say the deadly Indonesian earthquake lifted the island it struck by as much as 10 inches.

In the northwest of the island near the epicenter, the rupturing faultline lifted the earth by nearly a foot. In other places it dropped by 2-6 inches. Using satellite images of Lombok from the days following the August 5 quake, scientists from NASA and the California Institute of Technology's joint rapid imaging project made a ground deformation map and measured changes in the island's surface.

The quake killed more than 300 people while some 270,000 people are homeless or displaced. About 68,000 homes were damaged or destroyed on this island with a population of more than 3 million.

Nearly a week since the 7.0 quake, Lombok is still reeling but glimmers of normality are returning and devout villagers are making plans for temporary replacements of mosques that were flattened.

In Tanjung, one of the worst affected districts in the hard-hit north of the island, a food market opened Saturday and locals bought vegetables and fish. Some shops also opened for business despite being in damaged buildings.

""If I just stay at the camp and don't come here to sell then I don't have money to buy rice,"" said Natbudi, one of the market vendors.

Lombok, a popular but less developed tourist destination than neighboring Bali, was hit by three strong quakes in little over a week and has endured more than 500 aftershocks.

A July 29 quake killed 16 people. An aftershock measuring magnitude 5.9 on Thursday caused panic, more damage and more than two dozen injuries.

Villager Sunarto, buying fish at the makeshift market, said it was a relief to do something ordinary.

""I feel happy and thank God that finally the market is open,"" he said. ""We can buy our needs while waiting for the situation to get back to normal even though we're still worried.""

Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries.",world
"Public trust in the Philippines’ popular, yet polarizing, leader Rodrigo Duterte is at its lowest point since he took office in 2016, a new poll shows.

The study, administered by Social Weather Stations to gage public opinion with a president’s personality, showed that trust in Duterte fell 8 points, from 65 percent to 57 percent, his lowest score in nine surveys since becoming president.

However, the score was enough to maintain a rating of “very good.” Respondents were not asked to explain their rating, Reuters reported.

A rating decline is normal for a president at the two-year stage of his term, Ramon Casiple, head of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reforms in Manila, told the news agency.

Duterte enjoyed a high rating of 79 percent shortly after taking office.

A spokesman for the leader didn’t mention the survey results but welcome the support.

“We are now working double time to aid families affected by high prices while keeping the economy stable,” presidential spokesman Harry Roque said in a statement.

Pollsters surveyed 1,200 people face-to-face at the end of June, during a week where Duterte called God “stupid” and blasted the Roman Catholic Church after high-ranking priests criticized his anti-drug campaign that has left thousands dead and has been criticized by human rights groups.

At a Saturday news conference, he again took aim at the church, which is facing a number of child sex abuse scandals, calling priests’ groups “the most hypocritical institution in the Philippines today.”",world

The U.N. envoy for Syria hosted key diplomats from Iran, Russia and Turkey on Tuesday to discuss work toward rewriting the country's constitution, amid concerns about a possibly devastating military offensive on rebel-held Idlib province.

The talks led by Staffan de Mistura started and ended with little or no comment to reporters at the U.N. offices in Geneva, and offered a sideshow to the concerns about a looming battle for the northern province — the last remaining rebel stronghold in Syria after 7½ years of war and now home to some 3 million civilians.

De Mistura's spokesman, Michael Contet, said in an email that any debriefing by the envoy about the meeting will be ""reserved"" for comments that he plans to make to U.N. Security Council next Tuesday.

On Monday, the head of the U.N. humanitarian agency, Mark Lowcock, warned that Idlib could see ""the worst humanitarian catastrophe, with the biggest loss of life of the 21st century.""

Iran and Russia have backed a military campaign on Idlib involving Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces, despite Turkey's pleas for a cease-fire.

Before Tuesday's meeting, Hossein Jaberi Ansari, a special envoy for Iran's foreign minister, said a ""good result"" could emerge. Asked whether Iran shared the concerns about a possible humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib, Jaberi Ansari replied: ""We are worried too. We are trying to avoid this.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy for Syria, Alexander Lavrentiev, declined to answer a question on his way into the talks about whether Russia would stop its airstrikes.

De Mistura met informally with members of the three delegations on Monday.

The talks are set to focus on creating a constitutional committee under Syria's Russian- and Iranian-backed government. Russia, Turkey and Iran have been working together as ""guarantors"" for a series of talks around ending Syria's war. Turkey has taken in 3.5 million refugees from its neighbor.

On Monday, airstrikes on Idlib and Hama provinces forced some people to flee their homes, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.",world
"Russia said Thursday it is holding up release of a report by U.N. experts who said North Korea is violating U.N. sanctions including by not stopping its nuclear and missile programs and by ""a massive increase in illicit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products.""

Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters after a closed Security Council meeting on the report that he was blocking its release ""because we disagree on certain elements of the report.""

He said Russia also asked for an investigation into regular leaks of reports on North Korea to the media. The Associated Press and other news organizations reported the panel's latest findings in early August.

Nebenzia didn't disclose Russia's concerns but diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because consultations were private, said a key objection was the panel's mention of Russian ships being involved in illegal ship-to-ship transfers.

Britain's U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce, the current Security Council president, said there will be informal consultations Friday to determine what Russia's objections are in hopes of finalizing and releasing the report.

""I need to stress that this panel of experts report is independent,"" she said. ""It's an interesting question as to whether you should be objecting to an independent report. But, as I say, the council hopes we can resolve this.""

Pierce said the Security Council has been ""very strong"" on enforcing sanctions against North Korea, ""and getting this report out and implemented is the next stage in enforcing the sanctions.""

The experts' report said sanctions against North Korea are also being violated by transfers of coal at sea and the flouting of an arms embargo and financial restrictions.

North Korea also attempted to sell small arms and light weapons and other military equipment via foreign intermediaries, including Syrian arms traffickers in the case of Houthi Shiite rebels in Yemen as well as Libya and Sudan, the report said. And North Korea has continued military cooperation with Syria, in breach of U.N. sanctions.",world

The Russian military said Tuesday that its forces in Syria will help U.N. peacekeepers fully restore patrols along the volatile frontier between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

The Russian deployment in the area has highlighted Moscow's growing clout in the region, marking a successful attempt to balance the sharply conflicting interests of Israel and Iran.

""The Russian flag is the guarantor of peace and security on that land,"" said Lt. Gen. Sergei Kuralenko. He noted that Russian and Israeli officials have maintained regular communications, adding that ""operations by Russian military police help ensure the security of Israel.""

Kuralenko said that the Russian military police have set up four checkpoints on the edge of the demilitarized zone and plan to add another four.

""The Russian military police work in close interaction with the U.N.,"" he said, adding that they have set up a hotline with the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and held regular meetings to coordinate their actions.

Speaking to international reporters on a trip to the area organized by the Russian Defense Ministry, Kuralenko noted that a top priority for the Russian military police is to help clear mines left by militants. He said Russian forces have inspected the demilitarized zone and adjacent areas to help UNDOF map safe routes.

""We are offering all possible assistance to the U.N. mission to allow it to resume its operations in the demilitarized zone in full,"" Kuralenko said, adding that the Russian military police will be ready to leave once the U.N. mission fully takes charge.

The U.N. peacekeepers first deployed in the area in 1974 under a deal to separate Syrian and Israeli forces after Israel occupied the Golan Heights in the 1967 war, but they were driven away by al-Qaida-linked militants in 2014. Russia-backed Syrian government forces have recently regained control of the area.

Kuralenko said most U.N. facilities in the area were heavily damaged during fierce fighting between al-Qaida militants and Syrian government forces.

""The main problem is a large number of explosive objects left,"" he said. ""We see our mission not only in clearing mines, but also in training local personnel. We are helping train Syrian military engineers so that they can do the job themselves.""

By deploying its forces along the Syrian-Israeli frontier, Moscow has sought to assuage Israeli concerns about the Iranian presence in Syria.

Israel has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran, or its proxy Hezbollah militia, to establish a permanent presence in postwar Syria. Moscow, which has played a delicate diplomatic game of maintaining friendly ties with both Israel and Iran, warned that it would be unrealistic to expect Iran to fully withdraw from Syria.

But in a bid to accommodate Israel's security interests, Moscow announced two weeks ago that it struck a deal with Tehran to keep its fighters 85 kilometers (53 miles) from the Golan.

While Russia and Iran have teamed up in Syria to shore up President Bashar Assad's government, their interests don't always converge. Iran is loath to surrender any of its hard-won gains in Syria, but it can't afford a falling out with Moscow amid the continuing tensions with the U.S. and the Saudis. Washington's withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal has made ties with Russia even more important for Tehran.

"In the face of a bipartisan congressional effort to expand sanctions against Russia, the Trump administration is escalating pressure on the Kremlin over its interference in U.S. political life.

The State Department announced last week that it had called in Russia’s top diplomat in Washington and conveyed that the U.S. would “not tolerate” Kremlin “attempts to use social media accounts to promote violent and divisive causes in the U.S.”

U.S. social media companies are also taking actions. Facebook is removing over 30 pages and fake accounts that exploit social divisions and use methods employed by Russian agents who interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook’s diligence and pressure from U.S. authorities may help stem the threat, but by how much is uncertain.

Much of Russia's tradecraft in 2016, including on social media platforms, has been exposed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s indictments and congressional and media investigations. This diminishes its utility.

One ploy was Moscow’s attempt to manipulate the National Rifle Association, including through the alleged activity of Maria Butina, who federal prosecutors recently charged with conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent.

Former senior CIA Russian operations officer Charles Leven thinks the Kremlin may do more to incite violence, such as stoking racist and anti-immigrant passions by hyping alleged links to crime.

From the Kremlin’s perspective, the 2016 election interference may look successful despite political blowback in Washington and resulting expanded sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin may think he helped elect an American president that he favored.

Former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper says the Russians “actually turned” the election. If Clapper is right, perhaps not since the theft of U.S. atomic bomb secrets in World War II has Moscow been so successful in a covert operation in the U.S.

Russia will again threaten midterm elections in November, although by how much is unclear. On July 14 Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielson said Russia was not targeting the midterms with the same “scale or scope” as the 2016 presidential election. But on Aug. 2 Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats pointed to “a pervasive messaging campaign.”

The Kremlin may expect less favorable circumstances this November. To influence elections for the Senate and House, Moscow would have to invest on a wider geographical scale than in 2016.

Many states and localities will likely have hardened their electoral systems. Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms will be more resistant to manipulation. And Moscow may assess that few congressional candidates will be as favorably inclined toward Russian interests as the Kremlin likely believes Trump to be.

For these reasons Moscow might be more restrained this year, but it could be wilier.

The Kremlin might try to funnel dark money, possibly though U.S.-based shell corporations, to issue-oriented “social welfare” groups that have divisive goals. Under section 501(c)(4) of the federal tax code, such groups are not required to disclose sources of funds.

Using disguised websites and trolls, Moscow may continue exploiting social tensions, as it did after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting by inflaming the gun-control debate.

Some states and localities might still not have high security in their vote-counting systems, and Kremlin hackers may seek to penetrate them to alter results.

At the July 16 summit in Helsinki, Putin made clear his preference for Trump in 2016 because candidate Trump “talked about normalizing” U.S.-Russian relations. The Kremlin may want to protect its investment. It could visibly back some of President Trump’s opponents so as to deflect attention from its support for him. This would seem to validate Trump’s claim that Moscow will favor Democrats in November.

Former senior CIA Russian operations officer Charles Leven thinks the Kremlin may do more to incite violence, such as stoking racist and anti-immigrant passions by hyping alleged links to crime.

The Kremlin also may not overlook “open source” intelligence collection, to learn where races are close and how candidates might be vulnerable. Granular insights can be obtained from regional and local newspapers, as well as expert political reports.

Russian operatives may spot and assess those whose views accord with the Kremlin’s and seek to cultivate them online as unwitting assets. Moscow might ask some to volunteer for campaigns of candidates it opposes, so they can report on or expose inside developments. The Kremlin also can be expected to wine and dine U.S. political figures who visit Russia and seem vulnerable.

Intelligence officers, as Putin once was, know they must adapt and improve their tradecraft to stay ahead of adversaries. So it may be with Kremlin election ploys this year.",world
"Amid fears of a new cold war, an examination of Russia's nuclear arsenal by Fox News shows that there may be no need to worry about a devastating attack on the U.S.

Nuclear warfare experts say that Russia's arsenal of nukes is strictly for defense, and that while Moscow has a ""first strike"" option, it isn't likely to use it. In fact, a pre-emptive strike would not be very effective, according to military experts.

""Because we have this nuclear triad, the U.S. relies more on naval components, and for Russia, it's mostly land-based,"" Omar Lamrani, a senior military expert with Stratfor, a geopolitical intelligence platform, tells Fox News. He adds that the naval part of the nuclear triad -- the triad is a military force structure consisting of nuclear weapons launched from land, naval submarines and strategic aircraft -- is at an advantage over Russia due to its weak military.

“Because they have a weaker navy, they tend to use a more defensive strategy,” Lamrani says. “It gives them the ability to compensate for those primary military weaknesses.”

The Russian military operates on a fraction of the sum that supports U.S. forces, spending $69.2 billion annually compared with a much larger American war chest of $554.2 billion. While there are, numerically, more Russian land forces than U.S. troops, Russia's air and naval forces are considerably less robust, making its overall military structure much weaker.

Lamrani also suggests that Russia wants New START – Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -- to stay in effect and keep a level playing field with the U.S. as it gives Moscow a seat at the table of global diplomacy. The treaty between the U.S. and Russia has been extended about three times since it was ratified back in 2010 as a revision of the previous pact. Under New START, the number of strategic nuclear warheads are to be reduced by half; the treaty also limits the number of deployed strategic warheads to 1,500.

If the treaty were lifted, Russia would not be able to build up its arsenal and would be placed at a severe disadvantage, the military analyst says.

“If there are no limits on nuclear weapons, Russia would not be able to compete with the U.S.,” Lamrani says. “New START gives them a bargaining position.”

Other nuclear experts say that if there were an escalation between the U.S. and Russia, it could still be a tough-to-contain situation.

“There are no winners. That’s the widely agreed-upon conclusion,” Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, tells Fox News, “If things begin to escalate and escalate out of control, we very quickly get into significant exchanges of nuclear weapons. We're talking about many hundreds of nukes fired back and forth.”

“So you could try to put X's on the maps and see how quickly that becomes an overwhelming amount of destruction, and of course collateral damage with radioactive fallout.”

Kristensen also says that a comparison of today’s arsenals with those of the Cold War is a poor one. ""When we hear governments talking about the size of their stockpiles, they often compare them to the Cold War,” he says. “U.S. government officials will say ‘[Our stockpile is] less than 4,000 today; we haven't had that little since the Eisenhower years.'”

“And of course the point is just that, yes, there are fewer than there were during the Cold War, but the weapons we have today are immensely more effective than those in the Eisenhower years. It’s a very poor comparison because you could do a lot more with what you have today.”

The nuclear scientist points out that a half-dozen other countries -- France, China, the United Kingdom, Israel, Pakistan and India—building up their nukes collectively over the last half of the 20th century raised the number of nukes globally. While the Cold War nuclear players have decreased, other countries like North Korea are increasing the size of their forces. Kristensen adds that he believes the biggest nuclear threat is more than likely a regional scenario like India and Pakistan, or the Korean Peninsula. Such a conflict would likely draw larger nuclear powers in.

""So now you can imagine a scenario where the U.S. doesn't get involved through their own nuclear conflict, but through a regional scenario where it would then have to commit nuclear forces,"" Kristensen said. And if the U.S. gets involved, he adds, you can expect that ""someone like China or Russia might come along to defend the other side.”

With New START set to expire in 2021, Kristensen says that the most contentious issue is likely to be whether it will be extended for another five years. Failure to do so, he adds, could turn this debate a contentious global issue.

“I think if New START is allowed to expire, it would mean for the first time since the ‘70s we would have no limits, no constraints on U.S. and Russian strategic forces,” He says. “That’s a much more serious issue because of the enormous capacity of these strategic forces, and also they're much more directly threatening to both countries. INF [Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty] weapons don’t directly threaten the U.S. and Russia because of the range issue. They threaten regions and allies.”",world
"Russia and the West sparred over the reconstruction of Syria on Friday as its military forces continue to capture opposition-held territory and Syrians express hope that the country's seven-year civil war is nearing an end.

France's U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre made clear at a Security Council meeting that the European Union will not participate in rebuilding Syria ""unless a political transition is effectively carried out — with constitutional and electoral processes carried out in a sincere and meaningful way.""

Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky, whose country is militarily backing Syrian President Bashar Assad, countered that reconstruction should not be linked to politics and the international community should join the country's recovery effort now.

But Western nations are adamant about withholding reconstruction money to maximize pressure for a political transition.

Major powers including the five veto-wielding Security Council nations — the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France — agreed on a roadmap for a Syrian political transition at a meeting in Geneva on June 30, 2012, about 16 months after the Syrian conflict began.

The roadmap starts with the establishment of a transitional governing body vested with full executive powers, includes drafting a new constitution, and ends with elections. Successive U.N. envoys have tried to get the government and opposition to the negotiating table, so far unsuccessfully. The current U.N. envoy, Staffan de Mistura, is now working to establish on a committee to draft a new constitution.

After seven years of war, the country has suffered catastrophic damage and massive rebuilding is needed. Ground warfare, airstrikes and barrel bombs have left entire cities and infrastructure a landscape of rubble. In some places like Aleppo, the destruction is reminiscent of World War II devastation.

Earlier this year, the government estimated reconstruction will cost some $200 billion dollars and last 15 years. But like neighboring Iraq, which also needs massive reconstruction after the war against the Islamic State extremist group, no one is offering much to help fund the process.

Russia's Polyansky told the council meeting on the humanitarian situation in Syria that ""a critical challenge"" to the Assad government's call this month for the return of over 5.6 million refugees ""is the revival of the Syrian national economy — the generation of new jobs.""

""The country is experiencing an acute shortage of construction materials and heavy equipment for which fuel is necessary,"" he said, and the educational and health systems need to be revived.

Polyansky then said: ""It would be wise for all international partners to join assistance in the Syrian recovery effort, to eschew artificial linkages to political momentum.""

More broadly, he called for Syria to be reintegrated into the regional trade and economic system which ""will best advance the objective of overall normalization of relations among states in the Middle East.""

""And, of course, stabilization will help to advance the U.N.-led political settlement process which is unanimously supported by all members of the Security Council,"" Polyansky said.

But France's Delattre said a political transition with a new constitution and credible elections is ""the essential condition for the country's stability, and for our contribution to the financing of reconstruction.""

""Without that,"" Delattre said, ""nothing can justify having France and the European Union engage in financing reconstruction.""

And he added that without ""a breakthrough"" in the political process, the humanitarian situation will never be fully resolved.",world

A top official said Tuesday the Palestinians have filed a new complaint against Israel with the International Criminal court, after the United States said it would resort to any means to protect its allies against such actions at the international war crimes body.

The move comes a day after the U.S. closed the Palestinian de facto embassy in Washington because of its leaders' refusal to enter peace talks with Israel. National security adviser John Bolton also lashed out at the Palestinians for their attempts to have Israel prosecuted at the ICC, denouncing the court's legitimacy and threatening sanctions if it targeted Israel and others.

But at a press conference in Ramallah, Saeb Erekat doubled down by saying the Palestinians have asked the ICC to investigate Israel's planned demolition of the Palestinian Bedouin village of Khan al Ahmar in the West Bank. He also indicated the Palestinians plan to join other international bodies.

Erekat said the Palestinians have asked the chief prosecutor to meet with village representatives and include Israel's actions as part of her investigation into possible war crimes by Israel.

""The U.S. threats against the ICC are a coup against the rules in the international system,"" he said. ""The Trump administration wants to dismantle the international order to ensure that it can stay above the laws and escape accountability.""

Israel has long denounced Palestinian efforts to globalize their conflict by turning to external bodies with bogus claims. In particular, it says the ICC lacks jurisdiction because Israel is not a member of the court.

The Trump administration dramatically ratchetted up its rhetoric by threatening sanctions if the court pursues investigations against the U.S., Israel or other allies. John Bolton said the ICC ""is already dead"" to the U.S.

""The United States supports a direct and robust peace process, and we will not allow the ICC, or any other organization, to constrain Israel's right to self-defense,"" he said in a speech to The Federalist Society, a conservative, Washington-based think tank.

The administration also cited the refusal of Palestinian leaders to enter into peace talks with Israel as the reason for closing the Palestinian Liberation Organization office in Washington, although the U.S. has yet to present its plan to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

The Palestinians accuse the administration of dismantling decades of U.S. engagement with them by blatantly siding with Israel.

The closure of the PLO office was the latest in a series of moves targeting the Palestinians. Just last month, it canceled more than $200 million in aid for projects in the West Bank and Gaza as well as the remainder of its planned assistance for the U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees around the Middle East. Over the weekend, it announced it would cut $25 million in assistance for hospitals in east Jerusalem that provide critical care to Palestinian patients.

""We don't want confrontation with the U.S., by the way, but how can anyone with all these American decisions, Trump's decisions, believe that these people can be honest brokers, facilitators in any peace process? They are no longer partners in the peace process,"" Erekat said.

He said Israel should be held accountable for its plans for the Khan al-Ahmar encampment, a West Bank hamlet that has focused attention on what critics say is the displacement of Palestinians by Israel. European countries urged Israel this week to refrain from demolition.

Israel says Khan al-Ahmar was illegally built and has offered to resettle residents 12 kilometers (7 miles) away. But critics say it's impossible for Palestinians to get building permits and that the demolition is meant to make room for an Israeli settlement.

Israel's Supreme Court rejected an appeal last week, paving the way for demolition.

Palestinian activists put up several trailers early Tuesday in protest. Abdallah Abu Rahmeh said the white shipping containers, one with a Palestinian flag, were a message to Israel that ""it's our right to build on our land.""

Meanwhile, the Palestinian envoy to Washington said his staffers have been given a month to pack up after the U.S. punished them for what the State Department called the Palestinian leadership condemnation of ""a U.S. peace plan they have not yet seen.""

Husam Zomlot told The Associated Press the closure of the PLO mission would not deter Palestinians from seeking a state with east Jerusalem as the capital.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas halted ties with the Trump administration in December after the U.S. recognized contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The U.S. embassy was later moved there from Tel Aviv.

Zomlot was called home by Abbas in the spring as part of the crisis.

""We lost the U.S. administration but we gained our national rights,"" Zomlot said.",world
"Sweden has become the latest European country to have its political order shaken by a backlash against large-scale immigration, with voters giving a boost to a far-right party and weakening the more established ones.

Sunday’s election left the two rival blocs — a center-left group and a center-right alliance — with roughly 40 percent of the vote each, portending what is likely to be weeks of uncertainty and complex coalition talks before a new government can be formed.

The Sweden Democrats, which has roots in a neo-Nazi movement but has worked to soften its image, won 17.6 percent, up from 13 percent in 2014, for a third-place finish. That showing is not strong enough for it to lead a government, but it reflects how deeply that Sweden, famous for its progressive policies, is being transformed by migration.

The country that is home to the Nobel prizes and militarily neutral policies for the better part of two centuries has been known for its comparatively open doors to migrants and refugees.

Sunday’s general election was the first since Sweden, with a population of 10 million, took in a record 163,000 migrants in 2015 — the highest per capita of any European country.

That had followed the earlier arrival of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers.

Since 2015, the center-left government has sharply restricted immigration, but many Swedes complain that society cannot cope with integrating so many newcomers, many of them Muslims from Africa and the Middle East.

The growing strength of the Sweden Democrats also reflects how old taboos are collapsing.

Only a few years ago, Swedes would be shunned as racist for suggesting the country had limits on how many migrants it should take, or for expressing the view that it is hard to integrate Africans and Arabs. But people increasingly are expressing such ideas more freely — adding to the support for the party.

While the result is a boost for the Sweden Democrats, the party fell short of pre-election predictions.

The Expressen tabloid said in editorial that “it all pointed at the Sweden Democrats taking over the position as Sweden’s second-biggest party. But the expected ... bang didn’t happen.”

The election came after populist and anti-migrant parties made significant political gains in Germany, Austria and Italy since 2015 — the other countries that have shouldered the heaviest burden of accommodating those fleeing war and conflict or simply searching for a better life elsewhere.

Sweden also gained international scrutiny after U.S. President Donald Trump portrayed the country as place where multiculturalism has brought crime and insecurity.

In early 2017, Trump claimed that a terrorist attack had happened the previous night in Sweden. The night, in fact, had been quiet, but Trump had seen a Fox News report about crime by immigrants in Sweden. He has insisted that he is still right about the general picture of the country as one where large-scale migration has brought security threats.

That narrative of Sweden as a failed multicultural experiment is also pushed by some on the right in Europe. While some Swedes say there is some truth to that, others feel it is too exaggerated and ignores the fact that Sweden is a place with a strong economy where many things work very well.

Both the left-leaning bloc led by the Social Democrats and the center-right bloc, in which the Moderates is the largest of four parties, have said they would refuse to consider the Sweden Democrats as a coalition partner.

Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, who brought the Social Democrats to power in 2014, said he intended to remain in the job. His party emerged with the greatest share of the vote — 28.4 percent as the count neared completion — yet is looking at holding fewer seats in parliament than four years ago.

Lofven told his supporters the election presented “a situation that all responsible parties must deal with,” adding that “a party with roots in Nazism” would “never ever offer anything responsible but hatred.”

“We have a moral responsibility. We must gather all forces for good. We won’t mourn, we will organize ourselves,” he said.",world

“While checking the oil supplies for the Sohae Satellite Launching Station during the comprehensive inspections of wartime supplies on April 10, Hyon stated, ‘We no longer have to suffer and tighten our belts to make rockets or nuclear weapons.’ This was seen as an abuse of authority and a treasonous statement that opposed the Party’s military-first policy,” a source told Daily NK.

"The U.S. military said Wednesday that two Russian nuclear-capable bombers escorted by two fighter jets flew near Alaska on Sept. 11 before being intercepted by a pair of Air Force F-22 stealth fighter jets, according to a statement by the North American Aerospace Defense Command.

The Russian formation never entered U.S. or Canadian airspace, according to the statement.

NORAD said the Russian bombers and fighter jets were intercepted ""west of mainland Alaska"" by the American fighter jets at 10 p.m. ET Tuesday, but did not give a more precise location.

More than 18,000 people marched Saturday in Paris as part of an international mobilization to show popular support for urgent measures to combat climate change in advance of a San Francisco summit.

Crowds overflowed a plaza in front of City Hall before marching east to the Place de la Republique, carrying an urgent message that it's up to the public to put global warming at the top of the political agenda.

""Planet in Danger,"" read some banners.

Activists around the world encouraged ""Rise for Climate"" protests before the summit taking place Sept.12-Sept. 14. California's governor proposed the event after President Donald Trump vowed to pull the U.S. out of a landmark 2015 climate accord.

The international agreement was negotiated in France, and the French capital's march was more successful than ones held Saturday in other French cities or elsewhere in Europe.

Police estimated that 18,500 took part in the Paris march, while organizers put the number at some 50,000.

Several hundred people gathered in France's southern port city of Marseille. Several dozen called for an end to the use of fossil fuels outside London's Tate Modern art gallery. Only about two dozen showed up in Barcelona, Spain.

The front-page of France's daily Liberation newspaper featured a call from 700 French scientists for the government to ""move from incantations to acts to move toward a carbon-free society.""

The language was a reference to French President Emmanuel Macron's use of the phrase ""Make our planet great again,"" a takeoff on Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan.

The signing scientists also called for ""strong and clear political choices"" and said ""solutions are available.""

The march in Paris, organized with the theme ""Change the system, but don't change the climate,"" was both festive and serious.

One protester, Manuel Bibes, denounced the plastic that inundates daily life. Another, Rodgrigo de la Vega criticized the practice of driving down the road to buy bread.

""There is no Planet B,"" a sign read.

"Iran’s regime has not stopped its drive to secure technology and scientific knowledge to produce weapon of mass destruction, the intelligence agency of the German state of Baden-Württemberg disclosed in a report last week.

“Iran continued to undertake, as did Pakistan and Syria, efforts to obtain goods and know-how to be used for the development of weapons of mass destruction and to optimize corresponding missile delivery systems,” said the intelligence document, reviewed by FoxNews.com.

The intelligence agency — the State Office for the Protection of the Constitution — monitors threats to Germany’s democratic, constitutional order and is the equivalent of the FBI, operating at the state level. The counterespionage officials wrote that Iran’s illicit activities in Germany are concentrated in the classic sectors for espionage: politics, the economy, science, the military and the armaments industry.

“The observation and combating of proliferation efforts of ... Iran was also an important task of counterintelligence"" in 2017 in Baden-Württemberg, said the report.

Scores of specialized technology and engineering companies are located in the southwestern state. FoxNews.com reported in February that Iranian businessmen purchased material from the Krempel firm in Baden-Württemberg that later turned up in chemical rockets used to gas Syrian civilians in January and February.

Even after the revelation of the German construction material in the Iranian-produced chemical rockets, Germany’s Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control declined to halt trade between Krempel and the Islamic Republic.

The Baden-Württemberg intelligence officials said they had gathered “intensive intelligence on activities of Iran’s spy agencies.”

The 345-page report, released May 24, devotes lengthy sections to Iran’s sponsorship of the Lebanese terrorist organization Hezbollah, and to Tehran’s espionage agencies and state agencies of repression — the Ministry of Intelligence of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Revolutionary Guards Intelligence.

Last month, President Trump pulled the plug on the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), saying the agreement did not advance American security interests. Trump said that “not only does the deal fail to halt Iran’s nuclear ambitions, but it also fails to address the regime’s development of ballistic missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads,” adding that “finally, the deal does nothing to constrain Iran’s destabilizing activities, including its support for terrorism.”

German intelligence officials, who wrote the report prior to Trump’s May 8 decision to withdraw the U.S. from the nuclear deal, said Tehran’s “current worsening relations with the U.S.A., as well as Western governments’ critical views toward Iran’s atomic program, may lead to an increase of Iranian espionage activities.”

The report noted that Iran continues to spy on Iranian dissidents in Germany who oppose the clerical leadership in Tehran.

According to the report, “Iran has continued unchanged the pursuit of its ambitious program to acquire technology for its rocket and missile delivery program.” Iran’s reported test of the mid-range Khorramshahr rocket in September was noted.

Iran’s regime seeks German software, sophisticated vacuum and control engineering technologies, measurement devices and advanced electrical equipment for its missile program, said the report. Germany has been the European country most reluctant to crack down on trade with the Islamic Republic.

Last year, FoxNews.com reported that Iran's efforts to develop its nuclear and missile programs resulted in ""32 procurement attempts ... that definitely or with high likelihood were undertaken for the benefit of proliferation programs,"" in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Richard Grenell, the new American ambassador to Berlin — and a former Fox News contributor — reiterated U.S. policy in May in a tweet, writing: “As @realDonaldTrump said, US sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran’s economy. German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.”

Each of Germany's 16 states has a dometsic intelligence agency. FoxNews.com’s examination of additional intelligence reports released in April and May from the German states of Bavaria, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein and Saxony detailed, in terms similar to those in the Baden-Württemberg document, Iran’s illicit procurement behavior in Germany and its threat to international security.

Italian transport official Edoardo Rixi initially said 22 people were killed and eight were injured. Local reports, however, indicated the death toll could rise a rescue efforts continue.

The victims appear to all have been in vehicles when the structure crumbled beneath them, causing them to plunge nearly 300 feet to the ground, according to Borrelli. The concrete pieces also crushed two warehouses below, but officials believe no one was inside because the buildings were closed for summer holiday.

About 20 vehicles were involved, firefighter Amalia Tedeschi told RAI state TV.

The transport minister, Danilo Toninelli, earlier said the collapse was likely ""an enormous tragedy.""

""We are following minute by minute the situation of the bridge collapse in Genoa,"" Interior Minister Matteo Salvini wrote on Twitter.

Tedeschi said two people were pulled from the rubble alive as rescuers searched the scene for survivors.

The exact cause of the collapse was unclear, though a witness said he saw lightning strike the structure, which fell apart soon after.

""It was just after 11:30 a.m. when we saw the lighting bolt hit the bridge and we saw the bridge go down,"" witness Pietro M. told ANSA.



Authorities earlier said they suspected there was a structural weakness.

Images posted by state police and witnesses showed a huge section of the bridge missing and crushed trucks and cars. Parts of the structure also landed on the rooftops of nearby buildings. Video captured the sound of a man screaming: ""Oh, God, oh, God!""

Firefighters said they are concerned about gas lines in the area.

The bridge was inaugurated in 1967 and is about 0.6 miles long. It's an interchange between the northern regions of Lombardy and Piedmont and the beaches of Liguria.

The collapse also occurred on the eve of Ferragosto, a major Italian holiday. Authorities said traffic on the bridge was expected to be higher than usual because many people travel to beaches or mountains during the holiday.

Two years before the deadly collapse, an engineer said the bridge was bound for disaster. Antonio Brencich, who is also a professor at the University of Genoa, said in July 2016 that there were problems with the structure, Ingegneri.info reported.

"Sen. Dick Durbin (search) went to the Senate floor late Tuesday to offer his apologies to anyone who may have been offended by his comparison of treatment of detainees at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Nazis, Soviet gulags and Cambodia's Pol Pot.

""More than most people, a senator lives by his words ... occasionally words fail us, occasionally we will fail words,"" Durbin, D-Ill., said.

""I am sorry if anything I said caused any offense or pain to those who have such bitter memories of the Holocaust, the greatest moral tragedy of our time. Nothing, nothing should ever be said to demean or diminish that moral tragedy.

""I am also sorry if anything I said cast a negative light on our fine men and women in the military. ... I never ever intended any disrespect for them. Some may believe that my remarks crossed the line. To them I extend my heartfelt apology,"" Durbin said, choking on his words.

""They're the best,"" he said of U.S. service men and women.

""I think it was the right thing to do and the right thing to say to our men and women in uniform,"" said White House press secretary Scott McClellan.

Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist called Durbin's apology ""an honorable step"" along the road to understanding how words strengthen the nation's enemies in the war against terror.

""Intended or not, damage was being done,"" Frist, R-Tenn., said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""It's a lesson that we all learn over and over again and again.""

Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, in an interview that was to air Wednesday on FOX News Radio's ""The Tony Snow Show,"" tried to equate Durbin's comment with actress Jane Fonda's calling U.S. soldiers war criminals during a visit to North Vietnam in 1972.

""Some people always in their lives say something they wish they hadn't said,"" Rumsfeld said. ""We just watched Jane Fonda run around trying to recover from the things she did and said during the Vietnam War. ... He said some things and he's going to have to live with them, and I think that that's not a happy prospect.""

Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood said Rumsfeld stands by his statements, even in light of the apology.

Durbin said in the course of his remarks on June 14, he raised ""legitimate concerns"" about U.S. policy toward prisoners and whether their treatment makes America safer.

Durbin read from an FBI report that included descriptions of one case at Gitmo in which a detainee was held in such cold temperatures that he shivered, another in which a prisoner was held in heat passing 100 degrees, one in which prisoners were left in isolation so long they fouled themselves and one where a prisoner was chained to the floor and forced to listen to loud rap music.

""If I read this to you and did not tell you that it was an FBI agent describing what Americans had done to prisoners in their control, you would most certainly believe this must have been done by Nazis, Soviets in their gulags or some mad regime — Pol Pot or others — that had no concern for human beings,"" Durbin said last week.

After the uproar that followed those remarks, Durbin said he was not comparing U.S. soldiers to Pol Pot (search), Nazis or Soviet guards, but was ""attributing this form of interrogation to repressive regimes such as those that I note.""

Durbin attempted to clarify his remarks last Thursday evening and then again Friday, saying that he regretted if people did not understand his historic analogies, and he suggested that he could not verify the accuracy of the FBI document.

""If this indeed occurred, it does not represent American values. It does not represent what our country stands for, it is not the sort of conduct we would ever condone ... and that is the point I was making. Now, sadly, we have a situation here where some in the right-wing media have said that I have been insulting men and women in uniform. Nothing could be further from truth,"" Durbin said.

According to his spokesman, Joe Shoemaker, one reason the senator apologized was ""this loud, continuous drumbeat of misinformation that was being broadcast and printed.""

But on Tuesday, he left little room for second-guessing whether he considered his remarks an error.

""After reading the horrible details in that memo which characterized the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo, I then, on my own, my own words, made some characterizations about that memo ... I have come to understand that was a very poor choice of words,"" he said.

Under Pol Pot's regime, 1.5 million died in death camps and another 200,000 so-called ""enemies of the state"" were executed. The Nazis killed 6 million Jews and forced hundreds of thousands into slave labor. The USSR's Joseph Stalin (search) sent 25 million people to labor camps where many were worked to death.

While more than 1,700 U.S. soldiers have died helping to liberate Iraq first from Saddam Hussein and then from a deadly insurgency, no detainees at Guantanamo Bay have died in custody.

Durbin pledged to ""continue to speak out on the issues that I think are important to the people of Illinois and the nation,"" but added that he did not mean to diminish the image of the United States in the world.

""I don't want anything in my public career to detract from my love for this country, my respect for those who serve it and this great Senate. I offer my apologies to those who were offended,"" he said.

Immediately after his remarks, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he thought Durbin made a ""heartfelt statement"" and he was satisfied with the apology.

""He did the right thing, the courageous thing and I think we can put the situation behind us,"" McCain said.

In a written statement, Frist said: ""Senator Durbin's apology was a necessary and appropriate step in repairing the harm his earlier remarks have had on the image of the millions of fine men and women serving in America's military. As members of Congress we must always be sensitive to the fact that it is their struggles and sacrifices that keep us safe in the War on Terror,"" he said.

Asked what the next step for Durbin would be, an aide to Frist told FOX News, ""Well, when you say something that appears all over Al Jazeera, you have a lot of work to do.""

"Missiles were fired at Libya's capital Tripoli, including the city's only functioning airport, forcing authorities to divert flights to another airport to the south, government and airport officials said Wednesday, less than a week after the U.N. brokered a cease-fire between rival armed groups.

The source of Tuesday's missile attack was unclear and there were no casualties reported, the officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.

Mitiga International Airport posted on its Facebook page late Tuesday that the airport was closed and all flights were being diverted to Misrata International Airport.

Pilots were called Tuesday night to fly planes out of Tripoli to Misrata so they would not be hit, said one official.

""This was the only option to make sure they were not destroyed after the missiles landed on the airport grounds,"" he said.

Also on Wednesday, the U.N. envoy for Libya, Ghassan Salame, met with the head of the U.N.-backed government, Fayez Sarraj, and military commanders in the western town of Zawiya to discuss a ""Tripoli security arrangement,"" according to the U.N. mission in Libya.

""There is readiness by the international community to deal firmly with those who manipulate or violate the cease-fire,"" Salame said in the meeting.

The missile attack followed recent fighting in Tripoli between rival armed groups, which left at least 61 people dead. A cease-fire has been in place since last week.

Clashes in Tripoli erupted Aug. 26 when militias from Tarhouna, a town south of Tripoli, attacked southern neighborhoods of the capital, prompting militias supporting the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli to come to the city's defense. The fighting has killed 78 people and wounded 216 including eight children and six women, according to the Health Ministry.

Separately, the extremist Islamic State group on Tuesday claimed responsibility for an attack on the headquarters of Libya's national oil company in the capital Tripoli that killed two people and wounded at least 10 others.

Islamic extremists expanded their reach in Libya after the 2011 uprising plunged the country into chaos and toppled and later killed longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi.

IS was driven from its main stronghold, the coastal city of Sirte, in 2016 and fled inland.

Libya is currently split between rival governments in the east and the west, each backed by an array of militias.",world
"Pope Francis will summon the presidents of every bishops conference to a meeting in February to discuss preventing clergy sex abuse and protecting children, his advisers revealed Wednesday.

The Vatican is grappling with claims that the leader of the Catholic Church helped cover up an American cardinal’s misconduct.

The Feb. 21-24 meeting at the Vatican is believed to be the first of its kind, according to the Associated Press, and signals a realization at the highest levels of the church that clergy sex abuse is a global problem, as many church leaders have long tried to insist.

A delegation of U.S. cardinals and bishops is already heading to the Vatican Thursday to meet with Francis over accusations from a retired Vatican ambassador that he rehabilitated a top American cardinal from sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI for having molested and harassed adult seminarians.

POPE TO MEET WITH HEAD OF US BISHOPS' CONFERENCE OVER SEX ABUSE, COVER-UP SCANDAL

The Vatican hasn't responded to the accusations by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, but has promised ""clarifications"" that presumably will come sometime after Francis' meeting Thursday with the U.S. delegation.

The Vatican said Tuesday the meeting would be headed by Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, and also include Francis' top sex abuse adviser, Cardinal Sean O'Malley.

Di Nardo has said he wants Francis to authorize a full-fledged Vatican investigation into ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was removed as cardinal in July after a credible accusation that he groped a teenager.

The Vatican has known since at least 2000 that McCarrick would invite seminarians to his New Jersey beach house and into his bed, the Associated Press reported.

St. John Paul II made him archbishop of Washington and a cardinal in 2001, presumably because Vatican officials were impressed by his fundraising prowess and considered his past homosexual activity a mere ""moral lapse"" and not a gross abuse of power, it added.

POPE FRANCIS FACING CALLS TO RESIGN; SEXUAL ABUSE SCANDAL EXPOSES RIFTS IN THE VATICAN

DiNardo has also said recent accusations that top Vatican officials - including the current pope - covered up for McCarrick since 2000 deserve answers.

In addition, embattled Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl, who is facing calls to step down over his handling of sex-abuse cases, revealed this week he will travel to Rome to meet with the pope ""very soon"" to discuss his possible resignation -- which the cardinal had proposed two years ago.

Earlier this year, Francis faced what was then the worst crisis of his papacy when he repeatedly discredited victims of a notorious Chilean predator priest. He eventually admitted to ""grave errors in judgment"" and has taken steps to make amends, sanction guilty bishops and remake the Chilean episcopacy.

"Italy’s populist government said this week that it is considering cutting funding to the United Nations after the new U.N. human rights chief blasted the government for its crackdown on mass migration.



Former Chilean Socialist President Michelle Bachelet was appointed as High Commissioner for Human Rights last month, and has wasted no time in continuing her predecessor’s attacks on the populist and nationalist wave sweeping through Europe.



In her maiden speech at the controversial Human Rights Council on Monday, Bachelet criticized Italy’s populist government’s policy of denying entry to NGO rescue boats from the Mediterranean to its ports.



“This kind of political posturing and other recent developments have devastating consequences for many already vulnerable people,” she said.

Italy's coalition government of the populist Five-Star Movement and the nationalist League has taken a hard stance on migration, and has stood by its policy in turning away boats of migrants crossing from North Africa, despite strong criticism from the E.U.

ITALY'S POPULIST GOVERNMENT WON'T PERMIT BOATS CARRYING MIGRANTS TO DOCK, DESPITE EU PRESSURE

In her opening statement, Bachelet said her office would be dispatching teams to both Italy and to Austria -- where a right-wing, anti-migration government formed in December.



“We also intend to send staff to Italy, to assess the reported sharp increase in acts of violence and racism against migrants, persons of African descent and Roma,” she said in her opening statement.

Her remarks sparked a fierce response from League leader and Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who said that Italy may slash funding to the U.N.

""The U.N. is an organization that costs billions of euros, to which Italy gives over 100 million every year in contributions and we will weigh with our allies on the usefulness of continuing to give these 100 million euros to fund waste, embezzlement, theft for a body that wants to give lessons to Italians and that also has countries that engage in torture and (still have) the death penalty,"" he said, according to ANSA.

If I were the U.N."" Salvini continued, ""I would have half a world to send inspectors to before Italy. Go look for racism elsewhere, not in Italy.""

The Italian Foreign Ministry released a statement, calling Bachelet's remarks ""inappropriate, ungrounded and unfair.""

MICHELLE BACHELET, SOCIALIST EX-PRESIDENT OF CHILE, IS TAPPED FOR UN HUMAN RIGHTS POST

""Thanks to our decisive contribution, we have recorded a 52% percent reduction in the number of people drowned in shipwrecks in the Mediterranean since the beginning of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017. This is a result we are proud of,"" the statement said.

""And we are also proud that our efforts – humanitarian, political, diplomatic, financial and material – have produced an 80 percent reduction in the arrival of migrants on the coasts of Italy, and therefore of Europe, over the last 12 months,"" it said.

Salvini’s skeptical stance on U.N. funding comes amid a push by the U.S. to trim its obligations to the world body. The Trump administration has hailed cuts to the U.S. contribution to the budget, and has also cut funding to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency.

Last month, National Security Advisor John Bolton told The Associated Press that the U.S. intends to cut funding to Bachelet’s office as well as the Human Rights Council.

In June, the U.S. announced its departure from the Human Rights Council, with U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley describing it as a “cesspool of political bias.”",world
"Iran's nuclear chief told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he hopes the atomic deal between Tehran and world powers survives, but warns the program will be in a stronger position than ever if not.

Ali Akbar Salehi also told the AP in an exclusive interview Tuesday in Tehran that the ""consequences . will be harsh"" if there are any new attacks targeting Iran's nuclear scientists. A string of bombings, blamed on Israel, targeted a number of scientists beginning in 2010 at the height of Western concerns over Iran's program.

Salehi also said that President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw America from the 2015 accord ""puts him on the loser's side"" of history.

He added: ""That deal could have paved the way for building the trust and the confidence that we had lost.""

Salehi's comments come after Trump decided to pull the U.S. from the deal in May. The 2015 accord, struck under President Barack Obama's administration, saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.

In the wake of Trump's decision, Western companies from airplane manufacturers to oil firms have pulled out of Iran. Iran's rial currency, which traded before the decision at 62,000 to $1, now stands at 142,000 to $1.

""I think (Trump) is on the loser's side because he is pursuing the logic of power,"" Salehi said. ""He thinks that he can, you know, continue for some time but certainly I do not think he will benefit from this withdrawal, certainly not.""

Salehi spoke about Iran's efforts to build a new facility at Natanz's uranium enrichment center that will produce more advanced centrifuges. Those devices enrich uranium by rapidly spinning uranium hexafluoride gas.

For now, the nuclear accord limits Iran to using a limited number of an older model, called IR-1s. The new facility will allow it to build advanced versions called the IR-2M, IR-4 and IR-6, which can enrich uranium much faster.

""If we have to go back and withdraw from the nuclear deal, we certainly do not go back to where we were before,"" Salehi said. ""We will be standing on a much, much higher position.""",world
"The Trump administration is now pledging the U.S. will remain in Syria until the ""enduring defeat"" of the Islamic State group, a move that could signal open-ended American involvement in the war-torn country.

The announcement ""means we're not in a hurry to pull out,"" the U.S. special representative for Syria, James Jeffrey, told journalists in Washington Thursday, although he added that didn't necessarily mean a long-term American military presence in the country.

President Donald Trump has previously expressed a desire to get the U.S. out of Syria. There are roughly 2,000 U.S. troops deployed there, according to the Pentagon.

""We're no longer pulling out by the end of the year, we're going to stay in until we have an enduring defeat of (the Islamic State group),"" Jeffrey said. The other pillar of U.S. policy was the complete withdrawal of all Iranian-commanded forces from Syrian territory, said the veteran diplomat, who was appointed last month.

Jeffrey's comments come as the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, backed by Russia, prepares to retake the last pocket of territory of held by anti-government rebels, amid fears that could cause a bloodbath. An estimated 10,000 hard-core fighters, including al-Qaida-linked militants, are said to be hiding among 3 million civilians.

Jeffrey repeated a sharp warning to Russia, saying any offensive in the northwestern province of Idlib is ""objectionable"" and would be seen as a ""reckless escalation."" Jeffrey said a U.S. response to a Russian assault would involve ""all of our tools,"" but did not elaborate further.

The U.S. and the United Nations have repeatedly warned that a Russian assault on the enclave would cause carnage the scale of which has not been seen in Syria's seven-year war. The leaders of Iran, Russia and Turkey are set to meet in Tehran on Friday, widely seen as a last chance to avert bloodshed.

In an effort to increase pressure on Assad, the U.S. Treasury Department announced Thursday it was imposing sanctions on four individuals and five companies that have facilitated weapons or fuel transfers, or provided other financial or material support, to his government. They include Muhammad al-Qatirji and his Syria-based company Qatirji Company, said to facilitate fuel trade between the Assad government and IS, and companies based in Syria, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates that procure fuel for the government.

""The United States will continue to target those who facilitate transactions with the murderous Assad regime and support ISIS,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.

Trump campaigned on a pledge to keep the U.S. out of foreign wars and as president he made a number of statements saying it was time for American troops to ""get out"" of Syria.

The United States first launched airstrikes in Syria in 2014 at Islamic State group targets in the country's north, beginning a military intervention in the country that would steadily balloon over the next four years. In April Trump instructed military leaders to begin planning for a withdrawal from Syria.

Jeffrey said he was confident Trump now supported a more open-ended Syria policy. Jeffrey defined an ""enduring defeat"" of IS in Syria as creating the conditions where local communities can secure and govern themselves.

Trump administration officials have estimated that IS has been more than 90 percent defeated for months. A pocket of IS fighters remains in Syria and IS cells continue to carry out insurgent attacks inside neighboring Iraq.",world
"Investigators said Thursday they have found 166 skulls in clandestine burial pits in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, one of the biggest mass graves discovered so far in Mexico.

Veracruz state prosecutor Jorge Winckler said that for security reasons he would not reveal the location of the site.

Mexican drug cartels frequently use clandestine pits to dispose of their victims.

Winckler said the bodies were buried at least two years ago and did not rule out finding more remains. He said investigators had found 114 ID cards in the field, which held about 32 burial pits.

Clothes, personal possession and other parts of skeletons also were recovered, but investigators focused on the skulls in counting, because each corresponds to one person.

Veracruz was the scene of bloody turf battles between the Zetas and Jalisco drug cartels, but the state also suffered waves of kidnappings and extortions.

Winckler said prosecutors found the field after a witness told them that ""hundreds of bodies"" were buried there.

Investigators used drones, probes and ground-penetrating radar to locate the pits and began digging about a month ago.

Winckler said groups of relatives of missing people who perform their own searches for graves were not invited to participate in this one to maintain secrecy. He said they would be shown photos of items found at the site in a bid to help identify the remains.

Maria de Lourdes Rosales Calvo, who has been searching for her son Jonatten Celma Rosales since he was abducted with his girlfriend in July 2013, said the news of the newly discovered grave ""gives hope.""

""They await us in forensics next week to look at the belongings and IDs that were found,"" she said.

She said authorities invited all of the state's collectives of families searching for missing loved ones, including hers known as the Veracruz Mothers Network, to come to the state capital of Xalapa.

Her son was 25 years old and working in foreign trade when four armed men abducted him and his girlfriend from their home six blocks from the mother's home. When she reported it, authorities told her that she had to wait 72 hours. Later, they brushed her aside, saying the couple had run off, she said.

Four days after they were taken, she received a call demanding ransom and warned her not to go to the authorities. She paid a fraction of it for five seconds on the phone with someone who might have been her son. It was only long enough to hear him say, ""Mom,"" and then the line cut. She did not hear from them again.

It was not the first time that someone with inside knowledge of mass graves revealed their location.

In 2016 and 2017, Veracruz investigators found 253 skulls and bodies in burial pits outside the state capital, after relatives of missing people said they received a hand-drawn map from someone detailing the location of the graves.

In 2011, police found 236 bodies in burial pits in the capital of northern Durango state, which is also named Durango.

A total of 193 corpses were found in the town of San Fernando in Tamaulipas state, just north of Veracruz. Officials say most of those were Mexican migrants heading to the United States who were kidnapped off buses and killed by the Zetas cartel.",world

As North Korea celebrates a major anniversary this weekend, the presence — or absence — of Chinese President Xi Jinping could highlight just how much vitality has been restored to ties between Pyongyang and its most powerful backer after a prolonged chill.

A visit by Xi to North Korea for the 70th anniversary of the North's founding on Sunday is expected — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made three trips to China since March this year and has invited Xi to reciprocate — but neither side has said whether Xi will attend.

China could be keen to demonstrate the strong ties it has with Pyongyang to ensure it remains a key player in efforts to dismantle the North's nuclear program. But the celebrations come as President Donald Trump has blamed Beijing for the slow progress of denuclearization.

Below is a look at issues affecting ties between the allies.

___

WHAT'S THE TRUMP FACTOR?

Trump suggests that China has been encouraging North Korea to drag its feet with denuclearization to gain leverage against the U.S. in a trade dispute that has seen both sides leveling tariffs on $50 billion of each other's products. On Wednesday, he tweeted that North Korea ""is under tremendous pressure from China because of our major trade disputes with the Chinese government,"" adding: ""This is not helpful!""

China wasn't having any of it. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Washington should ""engage in self-reflection and stop flip-flopping and blaming others.""

""Regarding America's attempts to pass the buck, I'm sorry, we'd rather not accept,"" Hua told reporters.

China has already distanced itself somewhat from its significant cooperation with the U.S. on North Korea. After supporting tough U.N. sanctions and scaling back trade with the North after it ramped up nuclear and missile tests last year, Beijing has eased the pressure on its neighbor slightly.

___

WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF A XI VISIT?

No Chinese head of state has visited North Korea since President Hu Jintao met with Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, in Pyongyang in 2005, a time when Beijing was urging Pyongyang to reform its economy and take part in six-nation denuclearization talks.

When the younger Kim took power in 2011, exchanges slowed as Kim sought to assert his independence and China grew impatient with Kim's nuclear and missile tests. Ties frayed last year when China supported tougher U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang and suspended coal and iron ore imports.

That made Kim's three visits to China this year all the more striking, a sign that the relationship was back on track.

A visit on such a symbolic occasion would underscore the unique historical ties between the two countries' ruling parties. Mao Zedong sent Chinese troops to aid the North after the Korean War began in 1950, setting up a relationship once described as being ""as close as lips and teeth.""

Xi would also use the opportunity to reassert China's claim to a place at the table when key decisions are made concerning Pyongyang's relationships with both Washington and South Korea, including over a possible formal end to the Korean War. Beijing is determined to ensure its interests are honored, especially its desire to maintain the viability of Kim's regime and keep U.S. and South Korean forces far from its border.

""By going, Xi would reduce the sense that China is being excluded from any diplomacy going forward,"" said John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul. ""I think Beijing is worried that North Korea will go its own way and work out new relationships with Washington and Seoul and move out of China's orbit.""

___

WHAT IF XI DOESN'T GO?

If Xi were absent from the celebration, it could be a sign that China was displeased with North Korea's lack of progress with denuclearization, analysts said.

It ""would be a strong signal"" if Xi did not go, said Michael Kovrig, senior adviser for Northeast Asia at the International Crisis Group, indicating that ""North Korea has a lot to do to get back in China's good graces.""

But China could send a member of the ruling Communist Party's all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee such as Premier Li Keqiang to show that ties were still on track, Kovrig said.

Xi may stay away for more practical reasons as well. With China committed to U.N. economic sanctions on the North, it may be looking for real signs of progress toward denuclearization before giving up any political capital.

""For China, all actions should serve the interests of denuclearization and a visit by Xi will depend on whether there is an agreement on this,"" said Guo Rui, a North Korea expert at Jilin University in northeast China.

___

WHAT'S THE STATE OF RELATIONS?

Kim's visits to Beijing displayed all the customary pomp and circumstance bestowed on his father and grandfather. A separate visit to the northern port of Dalian showed the two leaders strolling along the beach and chatting amid lush gardens — all apparently intended to imply a warm personal relationship between them.

Diplomats say Beijing continues to implement U.N. sanctions covering exports of coal, iron ore, seafood and other products. In one area not covered by the sanctions, however, it seems to be cutting Pyongyang some slack: tourism.

Recent visitors to North Korea say numbers of Chinese visitors have exploded in recent months, with busloads turning up at key spots such as the Demilitarized Zone dividing the two Koreas and Mount Paektu that touches the country's border with China.

China is likely advertising the potential benefits of North Korean compliance further down the line.

""China has a strategy of trying to prevent North Korea from straying too far,"" Delury said. ""This relationship is full of mutual distrust, but they keep it within certain bounds.""",world
"Some 400 prisoners escaped from a jail in the Libyan capital, authorities said Sunday, as fighting between rival militias that has killed dozens of people forced the U.N.-backed government to declare a state of emergency in and around Tripoli.

The inmates overwhelmed guards and forced open the doors of the Ain Zara prison after riots broke out there, police said in a statement posted on Facebook. The prisoners included many supporters of the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi who had been found guilty of killings during the 2011 uprising that ended his rule and plunged the country into chaos.

The fighting in Tripoli erupted last week when the Seventh Brigade, militias which hail from Tarhouna, a town about 40 miles (60 kilometers) south of Tripoli, attacked southern neighborhoods of the capital. The Tripoli Revolutionaries' Brigades and the Nawasi Brigade, militias which support the U.N.-backed government, have come to the city's defense.

At least 47 people, including civilians, have been killed, and another 130 have been wounded, the Health Ministry said.

The government declared a state of emergency in and around Tripoli, saying the fighting is ""an attempt to derail peaceful political transition"" in the country. The government said it ""could not remain silent over the attacks on Tripoli and its suburbs, which is a violation of security in the capital and of citizens' safety.""

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned the violence in and around Tripoli and called on all sides to abide by a U.N.-brokered cease-fire.

Libya is currently governed by rival authorities in Tripoli and the country's east, each of which are backed by an array of militias. Other armed groups have carved out fiefdoms across the country, many profiting from smuggling and extortion.

Elsewhere in Libya, a rocket fell on a camp for people displaced from the town of Tawergha, killing two people and wounding 15 others, according to the municipal council.

A powerful militia from the nearby city of Misrata drove Tawergha's residents from their homes during the uprising, accusing them of siding with Gadhafi's forces, which had used the town as a staging ground for attacks on the city. Many have been living in makeshift camps since then.",world
"Does the queen use her fashion to send a message?

Queen Elizabeth II reportedly wore a brooch President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama gave to her during a visit in 2011 on the day President Trump arrived in the U.K.

The Obamas gave the royal matriach the vintage 1950 brooch, decked out with moss agate, 14-karat yellow gold and diamonds, according to Politico.

The queen reportedly wore the jewelry on Thursday, the day President Trump arrived in England, while receiving other dignitaries at Windsor Castle, the Daily News reported.

The next day, she hosted Trump and first lady Melania Trump at the castle for tea. Her son, Prince Charles, and her grandson Prince William did not attend the meeting. A source told The Times of London that they refused to meet with Trump but the palace denied the claims.

Trump called the queen a “tremendous woman” before his meeting with her.

""She is a tremendous woman. I really look forward to meeting her. I think she represents her country so well,"" he told The Sun. ""If you think of it, for so many years she has represented her country, she has really never made a mistake. You don't see, like, anything embarrassing. She is just an incredible woman.""

Thousands of people took to the streets of London to protest Trump's visit to the U.K.

"Allegations that disgraced ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick engaged in sex with adult seminarians have inflamed a long-running debate about the presence of gay men in the Roman Catholic priesthood.

Some conservatives are calling for a purge of all gay priests, a challenging task given that they are believed to be numerous and few are open about their sexual orientation. Moderates want the church to eliminate the need for secrecy by proclaiming that gay men are welcome if they can be effective priests who commit to celibacy.

Among the most outspoken moderates is the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and writer whose book, ""Building a Bridge,"" envisions a path toward warmer relations between the Catholic Church and the LGBT community.

""The idea of a purge of gay priests is both ridiculous and dangerous,"" Martin said in an email. ""Any purge would empty parishes and religious orders of the thousands of priests (and bishops) who lead healthy lives of service and faithful lives of celibacy.""

That outlook infuriates some conservative Catholics.

Citing McCarrick's case, Michael Hichborn of the Lepanto Institute, which promotes traditional Catholic teaching, says there must be a ""complete and thorough removal of all homosexual clergymen from the church.""

""It is going to be difficult and will likely result in a very serious priest shortage,"" Hichborn said. ""But it's definitely worth the effort.""

While the McCarrick scandal has intensified debate in the U.S. about gays in the priesthood, it's a global issue. Recent gay priest sex scandals have surfaced in Chile, Honduras, France and Italy.

In the U.S., where investigations may determine if church leaders turned a blind eye to McCarrick's penchant for young seminarians, there have been follow-up allegations of sexual misconduct in seminaries. Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston, who said Monday that he didn't see a letter sent to his office by a priest in 2015 concerning McCarrick's activities, recently announced an investigation into his diocesan seminary.

Catholic teaching, when it comes to homosexuality, is nuanced. The church says gays should be treated with dignity and respect, yet it has long taught that homosexual acts are ""intrinsically disordered.""

In 2005, the Vatican stated that even celibate gays should not be priests, saying church leaders cannot accept seminary applicants who ""practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called 'gay culture.'""

Pope Francis has reaffirmed this policy, despite his famous ""Who am I to judge?"" comment in 2013 when asked about a purportedly gay priest.

In a May meeting with Italian bishops, Francis said, ""If there's even the slightest doubt, better to not accept them"" into seminary, according to participants at the closed-door session.

On the front lines in implementing that policy are priests like the Rev. Thomas Berg, admissions director at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York.

Berg said he and his colleagues strive to rigorously screen the young men applying for admission, assessing their psychosexual development and emotional maturity. Applicants are asked about their dating history and their level of attraction to other males; Berg believes the process has reduced the number of seminarians with same-sex attraction.

As for gays already serving as priests, Berg says he doesn't advocate a ""witch hunt"" to root them out. But he says the church needs to identify sexually active priests, challenge them to repent, and consider their removal from the priesthood.

Berg proposes that dioceses appoint independent watchdogs — ideally people with law enforcement background — to receive and assess anonymous allegations of clergy sexual misconduct.

""Our problem is sexually active priests who are breaking their commitment to celibacy,"" Berg said. ""That wreaks havoc.""

Francis DeBernardo of New Ways Ministry, which advocates equality for LGBT Catholics, questioned the effectiveness of the seminary screening process.

""Anecdotally, what we're finding is that the policy encourages people to lie,"" DeBernardo said. ""If a man feels called to the priesthood, he'll rationalize that he should not admit his sexuality.""

The effort to exclude gays complicates things for those who do become priests, DeBernardo added.

""The institutional leaders want to promote a message that gay men should not exist in the priesthood,"" he said. ""So they don't offer healthy, holy examples of gay priests who are living their celibacy in effective ways.""

Rome-based journalist Robert Mickens, a veteran of Vatican coverage, argued in a recent essay that the church should be more forthright in acknowledging the substantial presence of gay priests.

""Rather than encourage a healthy discussion about how gays can commit themselves to celibate chastity in a wholesome way, the Church's official policies and teachings drive such men even deeper into the closet,"" Mickens wrote.

Some conservative Catholics blame the climate of secrecy directly on gay clergy, contending there is a ""homosexual subculture"" in many dioceses and seminaries.

""Numerous reports from clergy and seminarians are coming out worldwide which confirm the existence of networks of homosexually active men who cover for each other,"" said the Rev. Paul Sullins, who has taught sociology at Catholic University in Washington.

The current debate over gay priests is framed by the allegations against McCarrick — that he allegedly had sex with adult seminarians as well as abusing minors. Pope Francis ordered him removed from public ministry in June.

In past years, the debate has often focused on the problem of child sex abuse by priests — and the extent to which homosexuality played a role. Those questions are being revisited following the recent release of a grand jury report in Pennsylvania detailing alleged sexual abuse of more than 1,000 children by about 300 priests in six dioceses over a 70-year period.

A study by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, released in 2011, concluded that gay priests were no more likely than straight priests to abuse minors. Some conservatives, noting that about 80 percent of the abuse victims were male, nonetheless cite the findings to advocate for a purge of gay priests.

One of the top conservatives in the U.S. Catholic leadership, Cardinal Raymond Burke, indicated this month that he favors at least a partial purge.

""Now it seems clear in light of these recent terrible scandals that indeed there is a homosexual culture, not only among the clergy but even within the hierarchy, which needs to be purified at the root,"" he said in an interview with Catholic Action for Faith and Family, a conservative advocacy group.

""What is needed is an honest investigation into the alleged situations of grave immorality followed by effective action to sanction those responsible,"" Burke said. ""Shepherds can go astray ... and then must be appropriately disciplined and even dismissed from the clerical state.""

One of Burke's moderate colleagues, Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago, sounded a different tone in an interview with the Jesuit magazine America.

""I really believe that the issue here is more about a culture of clericalism in which some who are ordained feel they are privileged and therefore protected so that they can do what they want,"" Cupich said. ""People, whether heterosexual or homosexual, need to live by the Gospel.""

"A British couple found dead at an Egyptian resort hotel in late March died after contracting the bacteria E. coli, officials said Wednesday.

John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, were found dead while on vacation at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Hurghada. Cooper suffered acute intestinal dysentery caused by the E. coli, an Egyptian prosecutor announced Wednesday.

Susan Cooper had haemolytic uremic syndrome most likely caused by E. coli.

Officials said “no criminal violence” appeared on the bodies. Samples of the hotel’s water and air also tested negative for harmful bacteria, Sky News reported.

HOTEL ROOM WHERE BRITISH COUPLE FOUND DEAD HAD 'STRANGE ODOR,' EGYPTIAN OFFICIAL SAYS

Kelly Ormerod, John and Susan Cooper’s daughter, told Sky News on Wednesday she doesn’t believe her parents died from E. coli.

""The Egyptians are looking for someone to blame and I don't believe for one minute that caused their deaths,” Ormerod said. ""It is unheard of that someone dies of E.coli in such a short space of time.""

Thomas Cook, the travel company, said last week that high levels of E. coli and staphylococcus bacteria, which can cause toxic shock syndrome, were found at the hotel where the couple stayed. The company evacuated 300 guests as a precaution shortly after the Coopers’ deaths.

Ormerod previously recalled finding her parents seriously ill in their room.

""As I opened the door, I could see that my dad was extremely ill and he was staggering back to the bed,” she said.

""They [the doctors] tried basically to save his life and they couldn't — they did CPR on him but nothing could help him, nothing could save him,” she said. ""Mom had no idea what was going on — she was oblivious to what was actually happening because she was so poorly.""

E. coli is a bacteria commonly found in intestines of humans and animals. Most strains are harmless, but some could cause serious illnesses if toxins are produced.

Pope Francis told newly ordained bishops Saturday that they must reject all forms of abuse and work in communion to fight the clerical culture that has fueled the sex abuse and cover-up scandal rocking his papacy.

Francis cited his recent letter about combatting abuse during an audience with 74 new bishops from 34 countries in the developing world. The bishops are in Rome this week to learn how to lead their dioceses.

Their seminar has come during a moment of crisis for Francis, accused by a lone archbishop of having covered up for a disgraced ex-cardinal, who in turn has been accused of sexually molesting children as well as adult seminarians.

Francis has ignored calls from clergy and ordinary faithful to respond directly to the claims, saying there are times when ""silence and prayer"" are the best response.

Francis did however speak generally about the abuse crisis to the new bishops, many of whom hail from dioceses where the clerical sex abuse scandal hasn't erupted publicly in the same way that it has in the Anglo-Saxon world, Europe, and parts of Latin America.

""Just say no to abuse — of power, conscience or any type,"" Francis said, adding that to do so they must reject the clerical culture that often places clergy on a pedestal and which Francis himself has blamed for fueling the scandal.

Francis also told the new bishops they are there to serve their flocks, and must work in communion with the church, not as lone actors.

""The bishop can't have all the gifts — the complete set of charisms — even though some think they do, poor things,"" Francis said. The church, he said, needs unity of bishops ""not lone actors working outside the chorus, conducting their own personal battles.""

It was perhaps an indirect swipe at Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who broke with centuries of Vatican protocol and pontifical secret to name names and denounce two decades of cover-up by top Vatican bishops, cardinals and popes of the misconduct by ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick.

Vigano's bombshell accusations have plunged the papacy into crisis, with a steady trickle of revelations coming out about who knew what and when about McCarrick — and what they did with that information.

On Friday, Catholic News Service, the news agency of the U.S. bishops' conference, published a 2006 letter from a top Vatican official confirming that the Holy See knew as early as 2000 about McCarrick's penchant for inviting seminarians into his bed.

The letter, from now-Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, confirmed a key part of Vigano's testimony: That a New York City priest, the Rev. Boniface Ramsay, had written the Vatican's U.S. ambassador in November 2000 complaining about McCarrick's behavior.

Previously, there were reports that a group of concerned Americans had travelled to the Vatican in 2000 to complain about McCarrick, and Ramsay himself had said he had written the letter in 2000.

But the documentary evidence of Sandri's 2006 missive confirms that Ramsay's 2000 letter had indeed arrived in the Vatican, hadn't been lost in a pile of mail or ignored, and was still so present and relevant six years later that Sandri cited it in a simple request to Ramsay for information about a job applicant.

Vatican watchers have compared the McCarrick cover-up scandal to that of the Rev. Marcial Maciel, the 20th-century Catholic Church's most notorious pedophile whose sex crimes against children were ignored for decades by a Vatican more impressed by his ability to bring in donations and vocations.

Like Maciel, McCarrick was a powerful and popular prelate who funneled millions in donations to the Vatican. He apparently got a calculated pass for what many in the church hierarchy would have either discounted as ideological-fueled rumor or brushed off as a mere ""moral lapse"" in sleeping with adult men.

Francis in July accepted McCarrick's resignation as a cardinal after a U.S. church investigation determined that an allegation he fondled a teen-age altar boy in the 1970s was credible.

McCarrick's lawyer has said the allegations against him are serious and that he intends to invoke his right to due process at the appropriate time.",world
"The day after a grand jury report revealed that Roman Catholic clergy in Pennsylvania molested more than 1,000 children over decades, Adrienne Alexander went to Mass at a Chicago church and waited for the priest to say something about the situation.

He didn't. And that left Alexander fuming. So she went on Facebook to vent — then organized a prayer vigil in Chicago that became the catalyst for similar laity-led vigils in Boston, Philadelphia and other cities nationwide.

Alexander is among countless Catholics in the U.S. who are raising their voices in prayer and protest to demand change amid new revelations of sex abuse by priests and allegations of widespread cover-ups. They are doing letter-writing campaigns and holding prayer vigils and listening sessions in an effort to bring about change from the pews, realizing it's up to them to confront the problem and save the church they love after years of empty promises from leadership.

""I think it's important that the large body hears from us,"" Alexander said. ""We actually make up the church.""

Their grassroots efforts are gaining momentum. In the last week more than 39,000 people have signed their names to a letter demanding answers from Pope Francis himself.

Another effort, sponsored by reform groups, has seized upon the ""Time's Up"" and #MeToo movements and is organizing events across the country this weekend under the CatholicToo hash tag.

Some of the efforts are calling for specific reforms, such as laity-led investigations and transparency, while others are still brainstorming solutions. One woman in Michigan founded a website to make it easy for anyone to speak up and write to church officials.

""I've never seen anything like this before,"" Marjorie Murphy Campbell, a civil and canon lawyer in Park City, Utah, said of the laity's engagement. She said many Catholics feel they have no choice.

""You either have to get involved now, because you cannot trust the bishops to solve this themselves, or you leave. ... It's our job to help the mother church get through this.""

The actions come as the church is facing a global crisis over clergy abuse following the scathing Pennsylvania grand jury report and the pope's removal of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick from public ministry amid allegations McCarrick sexually abused a teenage altar boy and preyed upon adult seminarians decades ago.

Francis wrote a letter to Catholics in August, saying the laity must help end the clerical culture that has placed priests above reproach. He then found himself immersed in the scandal amid claims that he knew about allegations against McCarrick in 2013, but rehabilitated him anyway.

A collective of individual Catholic women last week wrote a letter urging Francis to deliver answers. The letter, which had more than 39,000 signatures by Friday, declared ""we are not second-class Catholics to be brushed off while bishops and cardinals handle matters privately.""

""In short, we are the Church, every bit as much as the cardinals and bishops around you,"" the letter said.

Robert Shine, a Catholic in Boston and vice president of the Women's Ordination Conference, said he believes Catholics are now ready to confront what's been happening in the church and talk about how they can be involved in reform, reflecting a broader trend in the U.S. with people getting more active in protests. Other denominations have been struggling with the issue as well.

""People are less willing to look the other way ... This new consciousness and new honesty about politics is sort of being transferred to the Catholic Church as well.""

Miriel Thomas Reneau of Ann Arbor, Michigan, founded a website to make letter-writing easy. Her site lists the names and addresses of local dioceses and includes templates for people to write letters to church leaders.

Others are withholding donations in protest. Legatus, an association of Catholic businessmen, announced it would put its annual tithe to the Holy See in escrow. Thousands of people have also signed a statement that calls on Catholic bishops in the U.S. to consider resigning as a public act of repentance.

There are examples of laity forcing change in other countries. In the city of Osorno, Chile, a group of lay members organized themselves to raise attention to the sex abuse crisis, and their movement helped throw out a bishop. It took more than three years, but they decided it was necessary to try to change their church from within.

Lori Carter of Ocean Springs, Mississippi, and two other women started a ""Wear Gray"" campaign in which they are urging ""prayer warriors"" like themselves to wear gray to Mass and fast as a symbol of repentance. They are also asking people to write letters to the pope and local bishops.

""I'm assuming it's going to have to go back to sort of how it was — a church of the people and prayer and holiness,"" she said.

In Minneapolis, Chris Damian believes having more nuanced conversations can bring about change. Damian, 27, organized a group of Catholic young adults to respond to the church crisis. The group has held a public prayer session, which St. Paul-Minneapolis Archbishop Bernard Hebda attended, as well as a discussion session where more than 100 people gathered to learn about the issue and brainstorm solutions.

The group is sending a letter to Hebda that urges pastors to listen to lay people, instead of telling them what to do. The letter also lists concrete recommendations, such as waiving confidentiality agreements for all past settlements and reopening the investigation into a former St. Paul-Minneapolis archbishop who resigned in 2015 after prosecutors filed criminal charges against the archdiocese for failing to protect children from an abusive priest.

""We're all really frustrated because things continue to pop up and that's just not acceptable,"" Damian said. ""I think we can spend all this time complaining about how churches aren't being more proactive ... but there's no reason why we can't take this issue and make the solution our own responsibility.""

"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced Friday that his country will be suspending missile testing and closing a nuclear test site, several reports said.

""From April 21, North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles,"" the Korean Central News Agency said, according to Yonhap News. ""The North will shut down a nuclear test site in the country's northern side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear test.""

The announcement comes amid preparations for a meeting later this year between President Trump and the North Korean dictator. During the summit, Trump said he expected to talk with Kim about denuclearizing the hermit kingdom.

TRUMP SAYS HE'LL 'RESPECTFULLY LEAVE' KIM JONG UN SUMMIT IF TALKS ARE 'NOT FRUITFUL'

“North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site,” Trump tweeted following the announcement. “This is a very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit.”

News of the testing suspension follows the revelation earlier this week that Mike Pompeo, the current CIA director and secretary of state nominee, met with Kim in North Korea over Easter weekend to lay the groundwork for the prospective meeting with Trump. The meeting, Trump said, could occur by early June.

Trump said Pompeo's meeting ""went very smoothly"" and said a ""good relationship was formed.""

""Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea,"" he said.

CIA DIRECTOR MIKE POMPEO MET WITH KIM JONG UN OVER EASTER WEEKEND

However, Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he would walk away from talks with Kim if he thought they were ""not going to be fruitful.""

""I hope to have a very successful meeting,"" Trump said during a joint news conference alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""If we don't think it's going to be successful, we won't have it. If I think it's a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we're not going to go. If the meeting when I'm there is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting.""

North Korea's decision Friday was made in a meeting of the ruling party's Central Committee, during which Kim, according to the Korean Central News Agency, said, ""Nuclear development has proceeded scientifically and in due order and the development of the delivery strike means also proceeded scientifically and verified the completion of nuclear weapons.

NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM HAS GROWN WITH EACH KIM REGIME

""We no longer need any nuclear test or test launches of intermediate and intercontinental range ballistics missiles and because of this the northern nuclear test site has finished its mission,"" he said.

North Korea also vowed to actively engage with regional neighbors and the international community to secure peace in the Korean Peninsula and create an ""optimal international environment"" to build its economy.

The country's diplomatic outreach in recent months came after a flurry of weapons tests, including the underground detonation of a possible thermonuclear warhead and three launches of developmental intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to strike the U.S. mainland.

"This week marks the start of the eighth year of the Syrian War. On March 15, 2011 a peaceful uprising turned into a vial, bloody battle between the brutal regime of dictator Bashar Assad and the freedom-seeking Syrian people.

Over these past seven years, the world has watched as hundreds of thousands of Syrians were murdered by Assad and his cronies. Today the international community sits idly by as airstrikes from the Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian backers rain down and destroy the country and its people, and further sow chaos across the region.

More than 500,000 people – including over 50,000 children – have been killed in the war since it began in 2011. So far this year, in just 10 weeks’ time, over 1,000 children have been killed or severely injured across Syria.

These statistics are hard to grasp, and the images and videos of the devastation are hard to stomach. The atrocities by Bashar Assad on the people of Syria are horrific, appalling and inhumane.

As a member on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, I’ve had the privilege of meeting with Syrian defectors like Caesar, victims of Assad’s brutality like Mazen al Hummadi, and aid groups like the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) and the White Helmets (Syrian Civil Defense) that work to help Syrian civilians.

Some of the stories of these people left our members near tears, while many stories left us physically sickened, horrified by what Syrians have seen and endured.

With Russia and Iran supporting him, Assad has used every weapon in his arsenal and has no fear of repercussions. Early on in the war, President Obama failed to adhere to his “red line” against the use of chemical weapons in Syria. And even though he said the use of such weapons was a “game-changer,” nothing changed.

Assad ignored calls for his resignation when he was urged to step aside for the sake of the Syrian people. He instead continued to use whatever means necessary to gain control over his people, or else eliminate them.

In 2013, the Ghouta chemical attack left innocent children gasping for their last breath, and took the lives of over 1,500 Syrians.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has confirmed over 30 chemical weapons attacks have taken place in Syria since the start of the war. Assad has used these chemical weapons in clear violation of international law, and in violation of countless resolutions by the United Nations Security Council.

Airstrikes, targeted raids, and cluster bomb attacks continue to occur almost daily, courtesy of the Assad regime, Russian planes, Iranian militias, and ISIS fighters killing civilians across the country and the Middle East.

The situation in Syria today is devastating, with no signs of immediate improvement. The proposed ceasefires are weak and have failed repeatedly in the past. As the conditions worsen, and as the West fails to act, the people of Syria are left to believe no one cares about their suffering and that nothing will be done to stop the brutality of the Assad regime.

Without hope or opportunity, and without education or a chance to live in peace, the children of Syria will continue to be a prime source for terrorist recruitment. Failing to act in Syria is opening ourselves and our allies to significant dangers to our own national security, and endangers our future generations in the years to come.

It’s time for the United States to exert leadership in Syria.

I am co-chair of the Friends of a Free, Stable and Democratic Syria Caucus, a bipartisan group that has urged the removal of Assad from power and for greater humanitarian aid to be allowed into the region. We have sponsored legislation that condemns the Assad regime, and we’ll be voting on legislation this week to ensure that the security of the Syrian people will be central to reconstruction and stabilization efforts in Syria.

Our bipartisan bill, H.R. 4681, is called the No Assistance for Assad Act. It would condition American support for reconstruction efforts in Assad-controlled territories on Syrian commitments to human rights; a political transition: and the safe, unfettered and voluntary return of Syrian refugees and internally displaced people.

According to the United Nations, over 12 million Syrians have either fled to neighboring countries or are internally displaced within Syria. The international community must step in to help, and much of this starts with putting a stop to Assad’s murderous rampage.

We can strengthen sanctions and put greater pressure on the Assad regime from other global leaders. We can employ safe zones or no-fly zones, and send more humanitarian aid into the country.

But above all else, we cannot turn a blind eye to the genocide before us.

The death toll in Syria continues to climb, four out of five Syrians now live in poverty, humanitarian access remains constrained by conflict, and the economy there has contracted by an estimated 40 percent since the start of the war.

The destruction and devastation can hardly be grasped in numbers alone, but watch the coverage and look at the images coming out of the besieged areas like Eastern Ghouta and Idlib. The brutality of the Assad regime is everywhere in Syria, and the effects will most certainly ripple outside those borders, creating even more chaos in the Middle East for us and our allies.

If we fail to act and if we fail to lead, we are failing humanity. Because failing to act in Syria is a failure on us all. We must learn from history, learn from past mistakes, and take action as a global leader for freedom and hope.

Allowing Assad to wreak such havoc on his own people sends a terribly wrong message to other human rights abusers around the world. What’s happening in Syria right now may very well be the worst humanitarian crisis of our time, and unless we put a stop to Assad, it will be a tragic, neglectful stain on the legacy of our great nation, too. We can and must do better.",world
"The death toll has risen to 11 with another 44 people hospitalized after a man allegedly drove an SUV deliberately into a crowd in central China before jumping out and attacking victims with a dagger and shovel, local authorities said Thursday.

The Hengyang city government said the suspect in the case had previous convictions for crimes including drug trafficking, theft and assault and, acting alone, had sought to ""get revenge on society.""

That appeared to rule out terrorism, although vehicles have previously been used in attacks blamed on militant Muslim separatists from the Uighur ethnic minority group.

Police identified the suspect as 54-year-old Yang Zanyun from Hengyang's Hengdong county in the largely agricultural province of Hunan.

Tuesday night's attack happened in a public square where Chinese typically gather to dance in groups or enjoy the cool evening breezes. The SUV apparently appeared without warning, jumping the curb before plowing into the crowd.

China has experienced violent attacks in public places in recent years, including bombings and arson of buses and buildings.

Occasionally, the attacks are attributed to militant separatists, though such incidents have become less common in recent years amid a stifling security crackdown.

In 2013, an SUV plowed through a crowd in front of Beijing's Forbidden City before crashing and catching fire, killing five, including the vehicle's three occupants. Police blamed the attack on Uighur extremists inspired by jihadi ideology.

More commonly though, the motivation is identified as mental illness, alienation from society or a desire to settle scores.

Chinese law restricts the sale and possession of firearms, and mass attacks are generally carried out with knives or homemade explosives. Many of those incidents have occurred at schools, including several in 2010 in which nearly 20 children were killed, prompting a response from top government officials and leading many schools to beef up security.

However, in June, a man used a kitchen knife to attack three boys and a mother near a school in Shanghai, killing two of the children. Last year, police said a man set off an explosion at the front gate of a kindergarten in eastern China, which struck as relatives gathered to pick up their children at the end of the day, killing eight people.",world
"President Trump said Thursday on a conference call with American Jewish leaders that he is using cuts to refugee aid money as a bargaining chip in order to bring back Palestinians to American-led peace negotiations.

Last month, the Trump administration slashed $300 million in yearly funding to the UN relief group UNRWA. According to a State Department spokesperson, the cuts were due to a disproportionate share of the burden and an endlessly expanding recipient pool.

UN Ambassador Nikki Haley doubled down this week on the decision by the Trump administration during remarks at the United Nations.

“We have for two years asked UNRWA to reform itself because it has this ongoing number of refugees that is unsustainable,” Haley said.

Palestinian refugee Abdul Majid Abu Srour, 85, has been receiving aid from the United Nations since 1950. Srour grew up in what is now modern day Israel, but after Israel’s war of Independence in 1948, he fled his home and claimed refugee status along with 700,000 others.

Srour, who lives in the West Bank, is one of over 5 million people now across the Middle East who gets assistance from the UN relief agency, UNRWA.

“This is a big mistake from the American president because the Palestinians have a just case and the U.S. knows what Israel did to the Palestinian people,” Srour said.

Palestinians who receive aid from UNRWA are not only located in the West Bank. More than 2 million Palestinian refugees live in Jordan, with more than 1.4 million living currently on the Gaza Strip.

UNRWA provides food to more than 1,000,000 Gazans each quarter, according to Gaza’s UNRWA Director, Matthias Schmale.

“The Palestinians and Israelis with mediators need to agree with this and until they have agreed on a solution that is seen as just and fair, UNRWA needs to provide these services,” Schmale said.",world
"Using unprecedented disciplinary action, the European Parliament voted Wednesday to sanction Hungary, saying the country poses a “systemic threat” to democracy and the rule of law.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government has been accused of breaching the EU’s core values in areas of migration, rule of law, and the media – which he denies.

It was the first move of its kind in the EU against a member state, garnering two-thirds of the votes.

If approved by national leaders, Hungary is set to face punitive measures. The ultimate sanction, the suspension of Hungary’s voting rights in the EU, is unlikely as Poland is set to veto that move.

The Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, called the vote “petty revenge” against his country’s tough anti-migration policies.

The vote involved “massive fraud”, Szijjártó claimed, since abstentions weren’t counted in the final tally, which made it easier to reach the needed majority.

Shaffer and others believe Iranians have long funded an array of insurgent outfits in Pakistan, in part as a means to destabilize U.S. efforts in the region.

One of those groups, the Tahrik-e-Jafaria Pakistan (TJP), freely acknowledges its ties to Iran, but denies accusations it engages in violence.

“We are alleged to be a militant group, but I refute this statement,” Deedar Ali, vice president of the TJP, in the country’s Gilgit Baltistan (GB) region, told Fox News. “We haven’t participated yet in militant activities, though we Shiites have the dominance in GB.""

TJP is officially considered a Shiite political party, founded around the same time as the Iranian revolution of 1979. It has twice been banned by the Pakistani government as a terrorist organization.

The U.S.-based Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC) defines the TJP as a group focused on creating a society based on “pure Islam,” and both a protector and a propaganda distributor of Shiite ideas.

So just how devoted to the Iranian brand of Islamism is TJP?

“We have close links to Iran and a mutual aim under a shared ideology to stand united under the current longtime supreme leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, who is the ultimate power for us,” Ali said. “His words stand no less than a decree for us.”

TJP leaders also frequently visit Tehran, but claim they receive no direct funds from the Iranians.

“We operate under the direct guidance and control of Iran’s supreme leader, which binds us to travel to Iran,"" Ali said. ""I won’t deny the fact that we receive a state guest honor upon our arrival in Iran because we support their ideology as we work together to formulate new strategies to gather mass support. But the members of this group present a monthly amount to run our campaigns; we don’t get funding from Iran.”

The State Department’s most recent Country Reports on Terrorism, released last July, names Iran the world’s “foremost” state sponsor of terrorism, a distinction it has held for decades.

Most notably, the U.S. accuses Tehran of using the Quds Force, an elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a cover for intelligence operations and destabilization across the region.

According to several U.S. intelligence and diplomatic officials, the Trump administration is more concerned about Iranian influence in war-torn, neighboring Afghanistan than it is about the activities of other insurgent groups in Pakistan.

The extremist Sunni creed adopted by the likes of the Taliban in Afghanistan against Iran and the Shiites is one part of the burgeoning proxy conflict. But while Shiites are vastly outnumbered in Pakistan, making up an estimated 20 percent of a Sunni-majority population of almost 200 million, Iran’s quiet support for Shiites could be significant.

“Iran seeks to exert influence by backing militant Shi’a groups inside Pakistan, but there are obvious limits to how far such an effort can go, as Pakistan’s Shi’a are far outnumbered,” explained Jonah Blank, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation.

Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), situated in the northernmost part of Pakistan, shares its borders with China to the north, India to the east and Afghanistan and Central Asian states to the west. Previously called the “Northern Areas,” it has exercised semi-autonomy from Islamabad – but has for years chugged on as a precarious, disenfranchised region without the independence of a recognized state.

Iran’s shadowy presence in the area has come under scrutiny in more ways than one,

Thousands of Shiites from Pakistan and Afghanistan have been recruited by Iran – specifically from the Gilgit and Baltistan areas – to fight alongside President Bashar al-Assad’s forces in embattled Syria, offered monthly salaries and postwar employment opportunities in Iran. Recruiters are often Shiite clerics who have studied in or have direct ties to Tehran -- the fighters are to augment its regional clout.

“We want to work closely with Pakistan’s government, but our priority to get a constitutional status for GB in Pakistan can never be stamped down,” Ali asserted. “Why are we yet to get a status? But if this were to happen, I can foresee GB will turn into a battlefield of the Taliban.”

RAPE, MURDER OF KASHMIR GIRL RAISE TENSIONS

PAKISTAN OUT TO CLEAN UP KARACHI, ONCE WORLD'S 'MOST DANGEROUS CITY'

Analysts worry Pakistan will spiral into an even more violent and complicated intermediary war between the region’s archenemies, Saudi Arabia and Iran.

“Iran backs Shi’a groups and Saudi Arabia backs ones that adhere to its own strain of Sunni doctrine,” Blank said. “Iran sees this as a largely defensive operation – protecting co-religionists against a violent onslaught that the Pakistan state is unwilling or unable to stave off.”

Some efforts are being made to quell sectarian unrest. In May, Pakistan’s security forces carried out a raid near Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan Province, killing leaders of the outlawed, Taliban-aligned group known as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), responsible for the deaths of more than 100 minority Shiites.

LeJ started as an anti-Shiite, contrary movement to the Iranian Islamic Revolution almost four decades ago – in which Tehran was quietly exporting its revolution to Shia communities abroad – and later aligned itself with the extremist Taliban and Al Qaeda insurgencies.

Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) emerged from LeJ in the 1980s, and has been accused by many of ushering in sectarian violence across Pakistan.

Those names were formally prohibited by the Pakistan government in its post 9/11 crackdown. So the group's leading member, Mulana Khalil Saqib, founded a “new” group with the operational name of Muttahida Deeni Mahaz (MDM) in 2013.

“Although it’s illegal to have unlicensed arms in Pakistan, in GB each and every man carries and has a heavy stockpile of illegal arms for a counterfight in the case of any terrorist activity,” he boasted. “As far as financing is concerned, we don’t have backing.”

Saqib later declined to deny he received “hefty funds” from Saudi individuals, stressing that the group has a “firm conviction that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are brother countries with shared values.”

The group's objective is clear: Push back the Shiites, and the TJP, in GB.

“This Iranian group has been involved in militant activities and innocent killings of Sunni Muslims. We do have demands to wipe off this Iranian group from GB because they have created unrest,” Saqib said. “Their unending sectarian violence has caused us to fight back for our rights. We want the Pakistan government to plan stern action against them.”

Saqib also asserted they have “more than 50 camps operating across Pakistan to train militants” destined for Afghanistan, and he expressed thanks for the “blessing” of the long-running war that opened the door to “opportunity.”

U.S. intelligence and military officials have long accused Pakistan of harboring and aiding such terrorist groups, despite being issued hundreds of millions of dollars in aid as a primary U.S. partner in the post-2001 war on terrorism.

Pakistan consistently and vehemently denies such charges.

In January, President Trump sent a New Years’ Day tweet accusing Pakistan of failing to act against terrorist sanctuaries, which have waged war over the border in Afghanistan, and cut $2 billion in military aid to the country. Last week, the United States suspended a further $300 million.

But several officials in Islamabad vowed to Fox News that they now have full control of a country once teeming with terror, and that all such safe havens have been mopped up and eliminated.

And while Pakistan’s new prime minister, Imran Khan, has vowed to be something of a middleman to help improve the increasingly hostile relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran, playing two sides inserts Islamabad into something of a quagmire.

Pakistan and Iran are thought to be getting closer, with the two countries having recently resumed discussions over continuing a $7.5 billion Iran-Pakistan pipeline project that started five years ago but has largely remained stalled. Yet government officials are said to assessing how Trump’s pullout of the JCPOA, better known as the Iran nuclear deal, and the subsequent reimposition of economic sanctions may hinder the project.

On the flipside, Islamabad and Riyadh have long been potent allies with a history of close military cooperation. However, Pakistan refused to contribute troops to the Saudi-led war against the Shia-minority Houthi rebels in Yemen, souring bilateral relations.

Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad and the Washington Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.

The Foreign Ministry in Tehran refused to comment and the Iranian Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the U.S. – which is within the Pakistan Embassy, given that the U.S. has no direct diplomatic relations – did not respond.

SUSPECT IN AMSTERDAM STABBING OF AMERICANS BELIEVE DUTCH INSULT ISLAM, PROSECUTORS SAY",world
"A delegation of U.S. cardinals and bishops is going to the Vatican Thursday to meet with Pope Francis over a sex abuse and cover-up scandal in America roiling the Catholic Church.

In addition, embattled Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl, who is facing calls to step down over his handling of sex-abuse cases, revealed he will travel to Rome to meet with the pope ""very soon"" to discuss his possible resignation -- which the cardinal had proposed two years ago.

Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, would meet with Francis on Thursday in the Apostolic Palace, along with Cardinal Sean O’Malley, Francis’ top sex abuse adviser. Also involved are two officials from the U.S. conference, Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez and Monsignor Brian Bransfield, according to a Vatican statement.

DiNardo has said he wants Francis to authorize a full-fledged Vatican investigation into ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was removed as cardinal in July after a credible accusation he groped a teenager.

DiNardo also has said recent accusations that top Vatican officials — including the pope — covered up for McCarrick deserve answers.

Francis in July ordered McCarrick, 88, to a lifetime of penance and prayer pending the outcome of a canonical trial into the groping allegation involving a teenage altar boy in the 1970s.

After the allegation was publicized in June, it emerged that it was apparently an open secret — including at the Vatican — that McCarrick routinely invited seminarians and young priests into his bed and abused them.

The McCarrick scandal took on crisis proportions two weeks ago after the Vatican’s former U.S. ambassador, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, accused two dozen Vatican and U.S. cardinals and bishops of covering up for McCarrick for two decades.

Specifically, Viganò accused Francis of rehabilitating McCarrick from canonical sanctions imposed on him by Benedict in either 2009 or 2010, according to his recollection. The Vatican hasn’t responded to the accusations, but presumably the “clarifications” it has promised will come sometime after Francis meets with the top U.S. church leadership this week.

Francis has refused to comment directly about Viganò’s claims, but nearly every day over the past two weeks his homily at morning Mass has seemed somewhat related to the scandal.

On Tuesday, he drew Satan into the fray, suggesting that the devil was behind Viganò’s revelations.

“In these times, it seems like the ‘Great Accuser’ has been unchained and has it in for bishops,” he said. “True, we are all sinners, we bishops. He tries to uncover the sins, so they are visible in order to scandalize the people.”

Bishops, he said, should be men of prayer, and should know they were chosen by God and keep close to their flock.

The McCarrick scandal comes after revelations in a Pennsylvania grand jury report on rampant sex abuse in the Catholic Church in August. Hundreds of priests were said to have molested more than 1,000 children since the 1940s and senior church officials, including the current archbishop of Washington, D.C., allegedly covered up the abuse.

Francis has met with Cardinal Wuerl, under fire over both the McCarrick scandal and for mishandling some abuse cases exposed in the recent Pennsylvania grand jury report when he was bishop in Pittsburgh.

Wuerl actually offered to resign two years ago when he turned 75, so the decision on when he leaves rests with Francis alone.

Tuesday Wuerl told D.C. priests that he would meet very shortly with Francis to discuss potential next steps.

In other eyebrow-raising comments Tuesday, a top aide to both Francis and Benedict said the sex abuse scandal was such a game-changing catastrophe for the church that it amounted to the church’s “own 9/11.”

Archbishop Georg Gaenswein told a book presentation that he by no means was comparing the scandal to the nearly 3,000 people killed in the U.S. 17 years ago Tuesday, on Sept. 11, 2001.

But he said the years-long scandal, and recent revelations in the Pennsylvania grand jury report, showed just “how many souls have been wounded irrevocably and mortally by priests from the Catholic Church.”

“Today, even the Catholic Church looks full of confusion at its own 9/11, at its own Sept. 11, even though this catastrophe isn’t associated with a single date but rather at so many days and years, and innumerable victims,” he said.

While no one has attacked churches with airplanes full of passengers, Gaenswein said, recent news from the U.S. “sends a message that is even more terrible than the sudden collapse of all the churches of Pennsylvania together with the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington.”

Gaenswein, who serves as secretary to Benedict and prefect of Francis’ papal household, was speaking at a presentation of a book by conservative American author Rod Dreher, who has been at the forefront in reporting on the recent scandal over McCarrick and Viganò.

Gaenswein recalled that during a 2008 trip to the U.S., Benedict spoke from the National Shrine to denounce the “profound shame” and pain that abuse had caused the Catholic community. Benedict is credited with having turned around the Vatican on the issue of sex abuse while he was cardinal, forcing bishops around the world to send all their cases to him for review because they weren’t sanctioning abusers.

Gaenswein’s said Benedict’s admonition was “apparently in vain, as we see today.”

“Neither the lament of the Holy Father nor the formal assurances and commitments pledged by a large part of the hierarchy has been able to contain the evil,” he said.

"Consumer boycotts of Danish goods in Muslim countries in protest of the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad are costing Denmark's companies millions, and have raised fears of irreparable damage to trade ties.

From Havarti cheese to Lego toys, Danish products have been yanked off the shelves of stores in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other countries around the Middle East as Muslims await an apology for the cartoons, which the Copenhagen government has said it cannot give. The boycotts have also spawned counter-boycott campaigns to ""Buy Danish.""

The boycotts began in Saudi Arabia on Jan. 26 when supermarkets either put up signs saying to stop buying Danish goods or removed products from shelves. Since then it has spread to other Muslim nations, and even to Western stores doing business there.

A supermarket in Cairo run by France's Carrefour has had signs, for example, saying that it is not offering Danish products ""in solidarity with Muslims and Egyptians.""

A spokesman for Carrefour in France said the store was a franchise run by a local company. While Carrefour is strictly neutral, he said, the stores operated by partners and franchises are free to make commercial decisions according to the local situations.

Indonesia's importers association on Wednesday began boycotting Danish goods, which it said made up $74 million in 2005, about 1 percent of the nation's annual imports.

In Syria, banners on walls and storefronts all call for consumers to avoid Danish products.

Employees of Danish Lurpak butter agent Yasser Al-Srayyed recently raised a banner in front of his Damascus office saying: ""Yasser al-Srayyed has stopped importing Lurpak."" The banner is now gone, but the imports have not resumed.

""It's a situation that causes a great concern from our members,"" said Henriette Soltoft, director of international market policy for the Confederation of Danish Industries, which represents Denmark's major companies.

""There's also the fear (for the future) ... that the consumer will not remember exactly what happened, but they will remember the connection to Denmark,"" she said, noting that the Middle East is seen as a growth area. ""Our good relations with these countries have been damaged but we don't know yet to what extent — that we'll see in the future and it will depend on how soon this crisis will be solved and how it will be solved.""

The drawings published by newspaper Jyllands-Posten in September have sparked protests, sometimes violent, in Muslim countries. Islam widely holds that representations of Muhammad are banned for fear they could lead to idolatry.

Iran's Foreign Minister Manushehr Mottaki reiterated a common position on Thursday, saying that ""in order for the Danish government to mend its relations with the Islamic world and Muslim peoples, it should issue a formal apology.""

Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen has repeatedly rejected demands for an apology, saying the government cannot be held responsible for the actions of an independent newspaper. The paper itself has apologized for offending Muslims, but has stood by its decision to print the drawings, citing freedom of speech.

European Union Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson has warned governments that if they are behind the boycotts that they could face action at the World Trade Organization if the EU proves they are involved. If the boycotts are purely consumer-driven, however, little can be done.

Denmark's Danske Bank estimates Danish goods worth $1.6 billion annually are threatened in 20 Muslim countries by the boycott. That compares with worldwide exports in 2004 of about $73 billion.

But Soltoft cautioned that the damage goes beyond exports, extending to service contracts, shipping and production facilities in the area — losses that cannot yet be quantified.

""It's really difficult to give an exact picture of the situation for the time being,"" she said in an interview Thursday.

Arla Foods, one of Europe's largest dairy companies, is thought to be the worst hit, losing an estimated $1.6 million each day.

Others have been affected to a lesser extent, like Lego, which said Middle Eastern sales only account for 0.2 percent of its sales and that many do not identify it as a Danish company.

""We have never marketed ourselves as a Danish product, we see ourselves as an international brand,"" said spokeswoman Charlotte Simonsen. ""You can ask Americans who think it is American, ask Germans who think it's German — many people don't know that it's Danish.""

The boycott has also spawned a grass-roots Internet campaign by people around the world urging others to ""Buy Danish,"" generally in support of freedom of speech.

""The Danish government has nothing to do with it and has been very correct that they have nothing to say about what newspapers publish, and we should not let these religious fanatics try to make them,"" said Tijl Vercaemer, an engineering student in Ghent, Belgium. He started his supportdenmark.com Web site after watching Palestinian gunmen briefly take over an EU office in Gaza on Jan. 30 in anger over the drawings.

Vercaemer said he has received thousands of e-mails in response to his site — one of many that have sprouted up in support of Denmark — including from Muslims expressing their solidarity.

On Wednesday he started selling stickers, at about $1 for 15 to cover his costs, with the slogan ""Help the Danes defend our freedom: SUPPORT DENMARK"" and said he has already shipped more than 700.

""It's hard to say whether the 'Buy Danish' campaign really works, it was more intended as moral support,"" the 23-year-old said. ""But I was very happy to read ... that some companies say that they really thought the 'Buy Danish' campaign could give them more income than the boycott could cost them.""",world
"The Iran nuclear deal is dead – and the mullahs who rule the Islamic Republic have only themselves to blame.

There is no need for President Trump to even announce that the United States is pulling out of the deal. Iran killed the agreement through its own willful actions and blatant lies, even before the deal was officially implemented on Jan. 16, 2016.

President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry – who negotiated the nuclear deal with Iran and the European Union, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany – heaped praise on the agreement when it was reached in July 2015, ignoring its fatal flaws.

The premise of the deal, which was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, was simple: Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities and said it would provide the International Atomic Energy Agency with a full accounting of its past military activities – meaning its secret efforts to develop nuclear weapons.

The Atomic Archive shows that Iran lied to keep its nuclear program a secret. The Iranian government’s lies mean the Iran deal is null and void, because Iran never fulfilled its end of the bargain.

In exchange for Iran accepting these restriction and disclosure requirements, the international community agreed to lift crippling economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Doing this pumped an estimated $100 billion and $150 billion into the coffers of the Iranian regime. It was as if Iran hit the jackpot in the richest lottery in the world – quite a victory.

But Monday’s revelation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be a game-changer. Netanyahu revealed a spectacular coup by the Mossad (Israel’s foreign intelligence agency) that spirited away Iran’s Atomic Archive, providing unequivocal proof that Iran never kept its commitments to disclose information about its nuclear weapons program.

Instead, the Atomic Archive shows that Iran lied to keep its nuclear program a secret. The Iranian government’s lies mean the Iran deal is null and void, because Iran never fulfilled its end of the bargain.

Iran got the money from the nuclear deal and by all accounts has been using it to brutally repress its own people, support Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in his civil war that has killed hundreds thousands of people in seven years, and wage a proxy war in Yemen against Saudi Arabia.

In addition, Iran has expanded funding for the terrorist groups Hezbollah and Hamas, which today bracket Israel from north and south with over 150,000 rockets and missiles. New armed Iranian drones, based in Syria, have attempted four separate attacks on Israel. The first was shot down by Israel inside Israeli air space and the other three drones were shot down by the Russians before they left Syria.

The Netanyahu press conference was blocked initially by Twitter when Netanyahu posted segments on his official Twitter account. This is not surprising. Netanyahu’s revelations have got the Obama-Kerry “echo chamber” in the media and the arms control community in full damage control mode, trying to save an agreement that never should have been signed in the first place.

A report issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency in December 2015 clearly shows that the agency acknowledged that Iran had stonewalled its questions, failed to provide answers about multiple nuclear weapons-related programs, and flat-out denied it ever had a plan to build five 10-kiloton nuclear warheads. The Atomic Archive that Netanyahu revealed on Monday exposed Iran’s denial as a lie, and proved that Iran had maintained a clandestine nuclear weapons program beyond 2003, when Iran falsely claimed its program had ended.

The International Atomic Agency report also exposed other Iranian lies about its nuclear program, including Iranian claims denying that it did metallurgy work for nuclear devices; denying that it conducted nuclear weapons-related multipoint initiation experiments; and hiding that fact that it deliberately scrubbed an area of the Parchin military complex where it had been engaged in explosives testing of non-nuclear components of a nuclear weapon.

The report also showed Iran lied when it denied doing computer modeling of nuclear explosive devices up through 2009; was clearly hiding information when it refused to answer questions about 2002 preparations for underground nuclear tests; and hid the fact that it operated two workshops where it conducted tests to fit a nuclear warhead onto a missile.

These are key areas of Iran’s previous nuclear weapons development activity that Iran failed to resolve with the International Atomic Energy Agency. In other words, the agency report that the Obama administration claimed “resolved” Iran’s previous bad behavior did nothing of the sort. It was a whitewash.

But Iran was taking no chances, even with a toothless “watchdog” like the International Atomic Energy Agency and a rock-solid guarantee from the Obama-Kerry team that no U.S. inspectors would ever visit Iran. As Netanyahu revealed on Monday, Iran gave the order in January 2016 to collect all incriminating documents dealing with its nuclear weapons development program and hide them away in high-tech vaults in a nondescript warehouse in the south of Tehran.

For two years, Mossad probed and planned. And then, as Netanyahu revealed Monday, in January Mossad pulled off what must be the most astonishing intelligence coup of Israel’s history and spirited out documents weighing over half a ton and brought them – or copies – to Israel.

So now we have incontrovertible proof that Iran was never in compliance with the nuclear deal. It never came clean on its past nuclear activities, and it set up an Atomic Archive so it could resume nuclear weapons work at a moment’s notice.

In other words, there never was an Iran nuclear deal. It was a hoax – a deception crafted with the full participation of President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry to let Iran off the hook.

In a YouTube message Thursday, Iranian Foreign minister Javad Zarif said you don’t broker the sale of a house, move in, and then two years later get to renegotiate the price. To extend his metaphor, if you move into the house but fail to make any payments on the mortgage – including the initial down payment – you get evicted.

"It’s something that may have escaped your attention, but it certainly hasn’t done so for American forces fighting on the front lines.

Perhaps you've seen it in photos. The Stars and Stripes neatly rolled up and attached to the gear of deployed military personnel. The red, white and blue standing in contrast with the muted colors of uniforms designed to conceal.

Why do they carry the flag? Whether it's being used to identify themselves to coalition fighter jets, mark territory claimed on the battlefield, or serve as a vivid and cherished memento, the American flag serves many a purpose among our forces down range.

“We always carried a flag on the first operation in a new environment,” retired Lt. Col. James Reese said.

It certainly adds context to those famous words written by Francis Scott Key: "" Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light.""

Currently, there are more than 1.3 million active-duty personnel in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard, according to the Department of Defense. The servicemen and women are spread among at least a dozen countries, including the United States itself.

""We always carried a flag on the first operation in a new environment."" - Lieutenant Colonel James Reese, US Army (RET)

Special Operations Forces (SOF), the elite units most often seen with the flag, are not nearly as numerous. According to U.S. Special Operations Command, there are just over 57,000 active-duty SOF fighters.

Of that number, only about 8,300 are deployed across 90 countries. In 2017, the Defense Department moved more than 15 percent of the deployed SOF fighters to assist African militaries, up from just 1 percent the year prior. There are roughly 1,200 SOF soldiers deployed to about a dozen African countries.

In 2007, after 25 years of service, Reese retired as a commander in the elite Army unit known as Delta Force. He told Fox News that soldiers often carry flags in case communications break down and they need to identify themselves to friendly forces.

This becomes especially important when special operations units are fighting with a coalition of different nations’ fighter jets providing support from on high. He called the flag a last ditch “far-recognition signal” on the battlefield.

It’s especially important for soldiers in places like Syria, where myriad nations provide air support but only a select few, including American fighters, are on the ground.

“Flags are carried so they can be put up when we occupy a new compound or fire base,” said another active-duty Army first sergeant, who requested anonymity because of his continuing ongoing service.

Reese said soldiers have been given greater autonomy over their garb in recent years, as long as they satisfy the standard packing lists mandated by commanders. Usually, soldiers must carry more than 200 rounds of ammo, medical kits, MRE rations, a weapon cleaning kit and a map, to name a few items.

When he was first in the Army Rangers in the 1980s, Reese said, all uniforms were disciplined and standardized, a practice that looked sharp but wasn’t the most practical for every soldier.

This mindset changed after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Now, he said, military branches in the U.S. and abroad mimic the way Special Operation Forces prepare and fight.

“What soldiers look like now is what we looked like 12, 15 years ago,” he said. “The military has quickly caught on to different ways we wear our armor. … [We’re] set up to be efficient.”

Efficiency of movement and mind is what Reese said kept him alive during his decades of service. He tried to keep himself as light as possible to navigate the battlefield as nimbly as possible.

“A bullet will hit someone with a lot of gear a lot quicker than someone who is light and nimble,” he said. “It’s all about efficiency.”

And in the case of that flag, a touch of simplicity, too.

So it is with that indelible symbol, giving proof through night and day that our flag -- and those who defend its underlying values -- are still there.",world
"There were multiple things to blame for the October ambush in Niger that left multiple U.S. service members dead, including insufficient training and preparation as well as the team’s deliberate decision to go after a high-level Islamic State group insurgent without proper command approval, the Pentagon has said.

Four U.S. soldiers were killed in October 2017 by Islamic militants who attacked their convoy in Africa with rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns. The body of one soldier was not found for two days.

The Pentagon’s report, released on May 10, took three months to complete, spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement. Defense Secretary James Mattis found “institutional and organizational issues, not isolated to this event that must be addressed immediately by the Department of Defense,” she said.

“However, no amount of investigation or corrective action will ease the agonizing grief that the families of our fallen must feel,” White said. “The Department hopes that the families will take pride and comfort in knowing – as this investigation makes clear — that their loved ones fought and died bravely in defense of our Nation, its people and the values we hold dear.”

From President Donald Trump’s calls to the families of the deceased to the White House’s delayed response to the ambush, details about the attack have drawn intense scrutiny and criticism. Read on for a look at what happened in Niger.

Who were the Americans killed?

Sgt. La David Johnson, 25; Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson 39; and Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, 29, were killed in the attack.

The bodies of some of the Americans killed were recovered by a U.S.-contracted helicopter, a U.S. official previously told Fox News. Sgt. Johnson's body wasn't found until two days after the attack as he and some Nigerien soldiers were separated from the others during the battle, the Pentagon said.

According to the report, the four killed “gave their last full measure of devotion to our country and died with honor while actively engaging the enemy.” It said none were captured alive by the enemy and all died immediately or quickly from their wounds.

What did the Pentagon say happened?

The Pentagon’s summary lays out a confusing chain of events that unfolded on Oct. 3-4, ending in a lengthy, brutal firefight as 46 U.S. and Nigerien forces battled for their lives against more than 100 enemy fighters. Amid the chaos, the report identified repeated acts of bravery as the outnumbered and outgunned soldiers risked their lives to protect and rescue each other during the more than hour-long assault.

Military officials found that the U.S. forces didn’t have time to train together before they deployed and did not do pre-mission battle drills with their Nigerien partners. And the report found that there was a lack of attention to detail and lax communication about missions that led to a “general lack of situational awareness and command oversight at every echelon.”

According to the report, the Army Special Forces team left their camp on Oct. 3 to go after an Islamic State leader who was suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of an American aid worker. But the team leader and his immediate supervisor submitted a different mission to the higher command, saying they were going out just to meet tribal leaders. That less-risky mission was approved, and when the team got to the location, the insurgent wasn’t there.

Senior commanders, unaware of the team’s earlier actions, then ordered the troops to serve as backup for a second team’s raid, also targeting the leader. That mission was aborted, however, when weather grounded the second team. The original group was then ordered to another location to collect intelligence on the insurgent, which they did without problems.

It was on their way back to the home base when they stopped for water at the village of Tongo Tongo, about 120 miles north of Niger’s capital. There, the group was ambushed by Islamic State-linked militants armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and small firearms.

The Pentagon said it could not conclude that the village “willingly (and without duress)” aided and supported the militants in the attack.

What else should you know?

The report included multiple recommendations to improve mission planning and approval procedures, re-evaluate equipment and weapons requirements and review training that U.S. commandos conduct with partner forces.

Mattis has directed Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa Command, to take immediate steps to address shortfalls and has given senior leaders four months to complete a review and lay out a plan for additional changes.

Why were troops in Niger?

U.S. forces have been in Niger for more than 20 years and a joint special operations task force was created by the U.S. in 2008.

In 2011, U.S. and French forces set up a counterterrorism force in the country, led by the French, with 4,000 troops and 35,000 Nigerien troops. There were 800 U.S. troops in Niger and 6,000 U.S. troops within 53 countries in Africa, Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last year.

But the presence of American soldiers in Niger reignited a debate about the Authorization for Use of Military Force – a public law enacted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. At issue is whether the law gives the president the authority to take action against all terrorist organizations, not just Al Qaeda and the Taliban.

What was the White House's response?

The White House has been widely criticized for its response to the attack – especially in the delay in acknowledging the ambush.

President Trump, too, was criticized for his public feud with a Democratic congresswoman and Sgt. La David Johnson’s widow. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., accused Trump of making “insensitive” remarks to Myeshia Johnson.

Trump has denied Wilson’s allegations, but the mother of the deceased soldier has backed up Wilson’s claims.

White House chief of staff John Kelly said he was ""heartbroken"" that Wilson used the conversation she overheard to attack Trump. Kelly, whose Marine son died in Afghanistan, added that the president did the best he could in the situation.

Because of the White House’s response to the attack, it’s been called “the president’s Benghazi” by some Democrats, referencing the controversial attack in 2012 that left four American service members dead.

"On more than one occasion the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez declared that being rich is bad, often adding “Rich people attack me for saying that, but I claim it is bad.”

His favorite daughter, however, may disagree.

According to the Miami-based Diario Las América, Venezuelan media sources will soon publish materials showing that María Gabriela Chávez has bank accounts in the U.S. and Andorra with assets totaling nearly $4.2 billion.

If the claim is true, Chávez’s daughter would be the richest person in Venezuela, a country with industrialists like telecommunications magnate Gustavo Cisneros (worth $3.6 billion, according to Forbes) and food and beverage mogul Lorenzo Mendoza ($2.7 billion).

Those figures stand in stark contrast to the overall state of the Venezuelan economy, which has been plagued by the collapse of oil prices, spiraling inflation rates caused by untenable fiscal policies and massive shortages of the most basic commodities, such as food, diapers and beauty products.

María Gabriela, 35, is the second-oldest of Chávez’s children, and she was the one who seemed to inherit his political mantle. After his 2002 divorce, she stepped into the ceremonial role of First Lady of Venezuela, accompanying her father on state visits.

After his death in 2013, she maintained warm relations with heads of state including Cuba’s Fidel Castro and Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and there have been suggestions that she will mount a campaign to become president after Nicolás Maduro steps down as president.

Earlier this year, Maduro named María Gabriela a deputy permanent Venezuelan representative to the United Nations.

Although the scope of her alleged wealth is much higher, allegations of her being rich aren’t entirely new.

Last July, Venezuelan outlets reported that she was involved in a scheme that favored an Argentinean rice company, Bioart, by importing 37,000 tons of greatly overpriced rice to Venezuela – a deal that reportedly contributed $15 million to her personal accounts.

Shortly after the allegation surfaced, María Gabriela posted to her Instagram account a note to her late father saying, “They speak about millions, about inheritance, about riches … and the think they insult us. They’re such simple beings that they have no inkling about the bigger riches that you always gave me and that you left me.”

In September of 2014, according to La Tribuna, the Cuban-American television journalist María Elvira Salazar showed on the air a receipt purported to be from a U.S. bank account in María Gabriela’s name that held nearly $737 million. The address on the account was that of the Venezuelan consulate in New York City.

The Chavista website aporrea.org claimed the receipt was “a fake from a fictitious bank.”

"The Trump administration put the Palestinians on notice Friday that it will shutter their office in Washington unless they’ve entered serious peace talks with Israel, U.S. officials said, potentially giving President Donald Trump more leverage as he seeks an elusive Mideast peace deal.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has determined that the Palestinians ran afoul of an obscure provision in a U.S. law that says the Palestine Liberation Organization’s mission must close if the Palestinians try to get the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israelis for crimes against Palestinians. A State Department official said that in September, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas crossed that line by calling on the ICC to investigate and prosecute Israelis.

But the law leaves the president a way out, so Tillerson’s declaration doesn’t necessarily mean the office will close.

Trump now has 90 days to consider whether the Palestinians are in “direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel.” If Trump determines they are, the Palestinians can keep the office. The official said it was unclear whether the U.S. might close the office before the 90-day period expires, but said the mission remains open at least for now.

Even if the office closes, the U.S. said it wasn’t cutting off relations with the Palestinians and was still focused on “a comprehensive peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.” The State Department official said in an email that “this measure should in no way be seen as a signal that the U.S. is backing off those efforts.” The official wasn’t authorized to be identified by name and requested anonymity.

The PLO office and the Israeli Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Although the Israelis and Palestinians are not engaged in active, direct negotiations, Trump’s administration has been working all year to broker a peace deal that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Led by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior aide, White House officials have been preparing a peace proposal they intend to put forward at an unspecified time.

The Palestinians, though publicly supportive of the U.S. effort, have been skeptical because Trump’s close ties to Israel suggest whatever deal he proposes might be unfavorable to them. The threat of losing their office in the U.S. capital could become another pressure point as the Trump administration seeks to persuade the Palestinians to come to the table.

The Palestine Liberation Organization is the group that formally represents all Palestinians. Although the U.S. does not recognize Palestinian statehood, the PLO maintains a “general delegation” office in Washington that facilitates Palestinian officials’ interactions with the U.S. government.

The United States allowed the PLO to open a mission in Washington in 1994, a move that required then-President Bill Clinton to waive a law that said the Palestinians couldn’t have an office. In 2011, under the Obama administration, the United States started letting the Palestinians fly their flag over the office, an upgrade to the status of their mission that the Palestinians hailed as historic.

Israel opposes any Palestinian membership in United Nations-related organizations until a peace deal has been reached.

The Trump administration has not revealed any details about its effort to bring about a peace deal that would ostensibly grant the Palestinians an independent state in exchange for an end to its conflict with the Israelis. But Kushner and other top Trump aides have been shuttling to the region to meet with Palestinians, Israelis and officials from neighboring Arab nations as it prepares to put forward a peace plan.

The requirement that the PLO office be closed if the Palestinians back an International Criminal Court move came in a little-noticed provision in U.S. law that says the United States can’t allow the Palestinians to have a Washington office if they try to “influence a determination by the ICC to initiate a judicially authorized investigation, or to actively support such an investigation, that subjects Israeli nationals to an investigation for alleged crimes against Palestinians.”

Abbas, the Palestinian leader, said in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in September that the Palestinians had “called on the International Criminal Court to open an investigation and to prosecute Israeli officials for their involvement in settlement activities and aggressions against our people.”

The U.S. law says that if the government determines the Palestinians have breached that requirement, it triggers a 90-day review period in which the president must decide whether to let the office stay open anyway. The president is allowed to waive the requirement only if he certifies to Congress “that the Palestinians have entered into direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel.”

The provision doesn’t explicitly define what would constitute direct or meaningful negotiations.",world

Brazil's Workers' Party on Tuesday replaced jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as its candidate for October's general election, clarifying one of the biggest question marks hanging over the vote to lead Latin America's largest nation.

The party confirmed the move after a meeting of its executive committee in the southern city Curitiba, where da Silva is jailed. Fernando Haddad, a former Sao Paulo mayor, will lead the ticket and be joined by Manuela D'Avila, a member of Brazil's Communist Party.

The move, while long expected, was an acknowledgement that the party could not get da Silva, who Brazilians universally call Lula, on the ballot despite numerous attempts in the courts.

""The struggle has just begun. Let's go, Haddad! Haddad is Lula!"" the Workers' Party Twitter account said. ""He was a Lula minister, he is a Lula attorney and best of all: he is a friend of Lula's.""

The political science professor turned education minister and later politician was meeting with da Silva Tuesday after the decision, members of the left-leaning party said. A press conference and formal announcement were expected later in the afternoon.

Da Silva is serving a 12-year sentence for trading favors with construction company Grupo OAS for the promise of a beachfront apartment. The former president, who governed between 2003 and 2010, has always denied wrongdoing, arguing this case and several others pending against him are meant to keep him off the ballot.

Lula led polls for more than a year, but his candidacy was recently barred by the country's top electoral court.

Recent polls show Haddad far behind, but the party hopes he will now rise with da Silva's endorsement. The current leader is far-right congressman Jair Bolsonaro, consistently over 20 percent in a race that puts several candidates at around 10 percent.

Haddad was education minister under da Silva and his successor, Dilma Rousseff. In 2012 he was elected mayor of Sao Paulo, the most populous city in South America, but failed to get re-elected four years later.

A Datafolha poll published on Monday shows Haddad in fourth place, favored by 9 percent. That was a rise of five percentage points in just a few weeks, but still behind Bolsonaro's 24, left-leaning Ciro Gomes' 13, centrist Marina Silva's 11 and right-leaning Geraldo Alckmin's 10 percent.

The poll had a margin of error of 2 percentage points. All the 2,804 voters sampled were interviewed on Monday, days after da Silva's candidacy was barred by the electoral court and Bolsonaro was stabbed in an incident that might put him in hospital until election day.

If no candidate gets more than 50 percent on Oct. 7, a runoff will be held on Oct. 28.

Political science professor Alberto Almeida, who has written several books on Brazilian polls, believes Haddad has a lot of potential to gain popularity, despite the little time for his campaign.

""By next week, it is possible that Haddad grows enough to see Marina and Ciro behind him. That was predictable because of Lula's high support at around 40 percent in the polls,"" Almeida said, adding: ""The race is clearer now.""",world
"A possible thaw in diplomatic relations between North and South Korea continued over lunch Saturday at the Blue House in Seoul, residence of South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

Moon's guests were Kim Yo Jong, younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and other senior delegates from Pyongyang, whose visit to South Korea is coinciding with the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

On Friday, Kim Yo Jong, 28, became the first member of the Kim family to cross into the South since the 1950-53 Korean War. The lunch marked the first time a North Korean delegation was hosted at the Blue House since November 2007.

South Korean television showed Kim Yo Jong and other officials, including the North’s nominal head of state Kim Yong Nam, smiling and shaking hands with Moon in the presidential palace’s reception room.

“I appreciate you stayed late out in the cold. Are you all well?” Moon asked the delegation.

Moon and Kim Yo Jong first came face-to-face at Friday’s Olympic opening ceremony, where they shook hands and praised athletes from the two Koreas as they marched holding a blue-and-white flag symbolizing a unified Korean Peninsula.

At Saturday’s meeting, Kim Yo Jong held what appeared to be a blue folder, which local media speculated may have contained a personal message from her older brother.

“If there is a message to be conveyed to South Korea or the U.S., she is amply well positioned to convey it,” Christopher Green, a senior adviser on Korean affairs at the International Crisis Group think tank, told Reuters.

Kim, one of the few people considered to have earned her brother’s absolute trust, serves as first vice director of the Central Committee of the country’s ruling Workers' Party. She is considered more important than Kim Yong Nam in North Korea even though she ranks diplomatically lower, Reuters reported.

Moon, meanwhile, has hoped use the Olympic Games to restore regular communication with the North and create an opportunity to resolve the tense international standoff over its nuclear program.

Moon had offered during his inauguration speech last year to attend a summit with Kim Jong Un if that would help solve the nuclear dilemma. However, it was unclear if Saturday’s meeting could be used as a foundation for larger meetings between the two countries.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence have warned Moon against falling for North Korea’s “smile diplomacy” during the Olympics.

The luncheon was the first time a member of the North’s ruling family member ever visited the Blue House, where in January 1968 North Korean President Kim Il Sung sent a commando squad in a thwarted assassination attempt on South Korea’s then-President Park Chung-hee.

"The leader of a Ku Klux Klan group based in North Carolina said he was “glad” that a woman died and others were injured after a man allegedly drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters Saturday at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va.

James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Ohio, has been charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wrongdoing and one count of failing to stop at an accident that resulted in death. Heather Heyer, 32, a Virginia paralegal, was killed in the incident and at least 19 other people were injured.

Justin Moore, the leader of the Grand Dragon for the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, told WBTV’s Steve Crump in a voicemail that he was “glad” Heyer was killed and others were injured in the vehicle attack.

""I'm sorta glad that them people got hit and I'm glad that girl died,"" Moore said. ""They were a bunch of communists out there protesting against somebody's freedom of speech, so it doesn't bother me that they got hurt at all.""

""I think we're going to see more stuff like this happening at white nationalist events,"" Moore added.

CHARLOTTESVILLE SUSPECT ACCUSED OF BEATING HIS DISABLED MOTHER, THREATENING HER WITH KNIFE, 911 CALLS SHOW

The KKK group is based in Pelham, N.C., and some members were in Charlottesville on the day of the protests.

""We were out there and I seen a lot of communist flags and anti-fascist and we're going to see more stuff like this,"" Moore said. ""White people are getting fed up with the double-standard setup in America today by the controlled press.""

""We should have been able to go out there and have our protest and it should have been peaceful but it's the anti-fascist and the communists continuing to try and stop us,"" Moore said. ""So I think there will be more violence like this in the future to come.""

Moore applauded Fields’ actions and called the suspect a “white patriot.”

""Nothing makes us more proud at the KKK than we see white patriots such as James Fields Jr., age 20, taking his car and running over nine communist anti-fascist, killing one [expletive] lover named Heather Heyer,"" Moore said in the voicemail. ""James Fields hail victory. It's men like you that have made the great white race strong and will be strong again.""

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe called Heyer brave and tweeted: “She died standing up against hate & bigotry. Her bravery should inspire all to come together.”

"Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez on Thursday urged Israel to reconsider the closing of its embassy in Asuncion, calling it an ""exaggerated"" response to the South American country's decision to move its embassy back to Tel Aviv.

The diplomatic dispute began in May when outgoing President Horacio Cartes authorized moving the Paraguayan Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, as the United States and Guatemala had already done. The move pleased Israel and Washington but infuriated the Palestinians and their supporters.

Abdo Benitez, who won Paraguay's election in April but had yet to take office when Cartes announced the move in one of his final acts as president, had said he would review the decision. On Wednesday, he said he would reverse it and move the embassy back to Tel Aviv, a decision applauded by Palestinian leaders.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately ordered the closure of the Israeli Embassy in Asuncion.

""I regret Israel's decision. The reaction of closing the embassy was a little exaggerated and we urge authorities to reconsider it,"" Abdo Benitez said at a news conference in Itapua, 273 miles (440 kilometers) south of Asuncion.

He said Paraguay would ""stick to international law and the United Nations' resolution that still considers it a territory in conflict"" between Israel and the Palestinians.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence spoke with Abdo Benitez on Wednesday and ""strongly encouraged"" the Paraguayan leader to follow through with its previous commitment to move the embassy to Jerusalem, according to a White House statement.

Cartes' decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem had been criticized within Paraguay.

The Palestinians want Jerusalem's eastern sector as the capital of their hoped-for state, while Israel sees the entire city as its eternal, undivided capital. Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war along with the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, territories the Palestinians want for their future state.

"The U.N. humanitarian chief condemned a Saudi-led coalition on Friday for carrying out two major airstrikes in Yemen in the last two weeks that killed dozens of civilians.

Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said he echoed Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' call for ""an impartial, independent and prompt investigation into these most recent incidents.""

He said a coalition airstrike on Thursday killed at least 22 children and four women fleeing fighting in Al Durayhimi district in Hodeida governorate. An additional airstrike in Al Durayhimi on Thursday killed four children, he said.

On Aug. 9, coalition airstrikes hit a bus in a busy market in Yemen's north, killing at least 51 people including 40 children. The attack drew broad international condemnation and the coalition said it would investigate.

The conflict in impoverished Yemen began with the 2014 takeover of the capital of Sanaa by Houthi Shiite rebels, which toppled the internationally recognized government. A Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Iranian-aligned Houthis since 2015.

Civilians have borne the brunt of the conflict which has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine, crippled the country's health system, and killed over 10,000 people.

The Houthis had blamed Thursday's attack in Hodeida on the coalition. But state media of the United Arab Emirates, a key coalition member, disputed the claim and said the rebels launched the attack, killing one child and injuring dozens.

Neither side's claims could be independently verified, but Lowcock's statement put the blame on the coalition.

He stressed that the humanitarian operation in Yemen is currently the largest in the world, with three-quarters of the population in need of aid. In 2018, he said, the U.N. and its partners assisted more than 8 million people.

Lowcock expressed deep concern at the proximity of attacks to humanitarian sites including health facilities and water and sanitation operations.

""The parties to the conflict must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and those with influence over them must ensure that everything possible is done to protect civilians,"" he said.

Lowcock's condemnation of the recent coalition airstrikes follows the release earlier Friday of a 90-page report by Human Rights Watch accusing the Saudis and others of failing to conduct credible investigations into alleged war crimes committed in Yemen or redress the toll on civilians.",world

"At least four people were injured in Massachusetts Thursday night after ""suspected gas explosions"" tore through several communities outside of Boston, officials confirmed.

Preliminary numbers estimate that between 60 to 100 homes in the Merrimack Valley caught fire in the towns of Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, Methuen Police Chief Joseph Soloman said.

State Police (MSP) confirmed on Twitter that at least 39 locations were affected by ""fires and explosions,"" but the number ""will grow.""

Residents in the aforementioned towns that are serviced by Columbia Gas of Massachusetts ""should evacuate their homes immediately if they have not already done so,"" police advised. Gas service was shut down by the company to roughly 8,000 customers.

""Numerous evacuations of neighborhoods where there are gas odors are underway,"" MSP tweeted. While they added it's ""far too early to speculate on cause,"" Columbia Gas is working to depressurize its gas lines, which ""will take some time.""

National Grid is cutting electricity to the three towns ""to limit spark-started fires.""

Solomon said that in Lawrence alone, there are roughly 20 to 25 homes on fire. He said there are so many fires ""you can't even see the sky.""

Soloman said there are no fires in Methuen, but the town's emergency officials are sending aid to areas in need.

In the town of Andover, firefighters responded to 35 fires total — all of which have been extinguished. ""At peak, 18 fires were burning at the same time,"" city police said.

Local officials said at least one firefighter and two civilians were injured in the ""gas-related fires.""

The North Andover Police Department advised residents with gas service in their homes or businesses to ""please exit the building until further notice.""

Some residents are being evacuated from their homes to senior centers and middle schools as officials investigate the situation, police said. It was not immediately clear whether anyone sustained injuries.

Merrimack College, which is located in North Andover, advised that ""in an over abundance of caution,"" students and faculty needed to evacuate all buildings on campus, but later said all buildings were ""safe for re-entry.""

"Philippine authorities began evacuating thousands of people Thursday in the path of the most powerful typhoon this year, closing schools, readying bulldozers for landslides and placing rescuers and troops on full alert in the country's north.

Typhoon Mangkhut could hit northeastern Cagayan province on Saturday. It was tracked on Thursday about 450 miles away in the Pacific with sustained winds of 127 miles per hour and gusts of up to 158 mph, Philippine forecasters said.

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii categorized Mangkhut as a super typhoon with powerful winds and gusts.

With a massive raincloud band 900 kilometers (560 miles) wide, combined with seasonal monsoon rains, the typhoon could bring heavy to intense rains that could set off landslides and flash floods, government forecasters said. Storm warnings have been raised in 25 provinces on the main northern island of Luzon, restricting sea travel.

Office of Civil Defense chief Ricardo Jalad said more than 4 million people in the northeastern provinces of Cagayan and Isabela and outlying provincial regions are vulnerable to the most destructive effects near the typhoon's 77-mile-wide eye. Nearly 48,000 houses in those high-risk areas are made of light materials and vulnerable to Mangkhut's ferocious winds.

Cagayan Gov. Manuel Mamba said by telephone that evacuations of residents from risky coastal villages and island municipalities north of the rice-and corn-producing province of 1.2 million people have started and classes at all levels have been canceled.

""The weather here is still good but we're moving them now because it's very important that when it comes, people will be away from peril,"" Mamba said.

The typhoon was slightly changing its track, Mamba said, adding that authorities needed to rapidly reassess where to redeploy emergency teams and supplies.

The typhoon is approaching at the start of the rice and corn harvesting season in Cagayan, a major agricultural producer, and farmers were scrambling to save what they could of their crops, Mamba said. The threat to agriculture comes as the Philippines tries to cope with rice shortages.

The Office of Civil Defense said other northern provinces also started evacuating residents Thursday from high-risk areas, including in northern mountain provinces prone to rain and mudslides. Residents covered glass windows with wood, strengthened houses with rope and wooden braces and moved fishing boats to safety.

President Rodrigo Duterte canceled his appearance at a missile test firing aboard a navy ship off northern Bataan province due to the approaching typhoon and instead led a meeting with disaster-response agencies and defense officials in Manila.

On Guam, where Mangkhut has passed, residents woke up Tuesday to flooded streets, downed trees and widespread power outages. Government agencies were conducting damage assessments and beginning to clear roads, according to the Pacific Daily News.

About 80 percent of the U.S. territory was without power but it was restored by Thursday morning.

Mangkhut, a Thai word for mangosteen, is the 15th storm this year to batter the Philippines, which is hit by about 20 a year and is considered one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. Typhoon Haiyan left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and displaced over 5 million in the central Philippines in 2013.",world

President Vladimir Putin on Thursday attended Russia's biggest-ever war games, which involved some 300,000 troops as well as a significant contingent of Chinese forces.

The weeklong Vostok (East) 2018 maneuvers span vast expanses of Siberia and the Far East, the Arctic and the Pacific Oceans and showcase the military might of Russia and China at a time of simmering tensions with the U.S.

As well as the troops, some 1,000 Russian aircraft and 36,000 tanks and other combat vehicles are involved. The exercise surpasses even the biggest Soviet maneuvers in 1981.

China sent about 3,200 troops, 900 combat vehicles and 30 aircraft to join the drills at a Siberian firing range, a deployment that reflects its shift toward a full-fledged military alliance with Russia.

Speaking at the Tsugol firing range about 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of the border with China, where Russian and Chinese troops performed joint drills, Putin lauded the troops for their skills, saying they ""demonstrated their capability to deflect potential military threats.""

He emphasized that ""Russia is a peaceful nation,"" but noted that the country needs to strengthen its military capability to ""be ready to protect its sovereignty, security and national interests, and, if necessary, support our allies.""

The Chinese media have described the People's Liberation Army involvement in the drills as the country's largest-ever dispatch of forces abroad for war games.

From China's perspective, the emerging military alliance with Russia sends a strong signal to the U.S. and its ally Japan. China is intent on defending its interests in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety, as well as Taiwan and the Senkaku and Diaoyu islands controlled by Japan but claimed by Beijing.

For Russia, the increasingly robust alliance with China is particularly important in light of the strained relations with the U.S. and its allies and the looming threat of more biting U.S. sanctions.

The drills come amid tensions over Syria, where the U.S. and its allies threatened to launch strikes against President Bashar Assad's government if it uses chemical weapons to reclaim control of the rebel-held northwestern province of Idlib.

Russia, which has waged a military campaign in support of Assad, strongly warned the U.S. against military action in Syria.

"President Barack Obama said Saturday that the deaths of Americans in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan are a reminder of the ""extraordinary"" price the U.S. military is paying in the decade-long Afghan war.

Insurgents shot down a U.S. military helicopter during fighting in eastern Afghanistan, killing 30 Americans, most of them belonging to the same elite unit as the Navy SEALs who killed former Al Qaeda leader Usama bin Laden, U.S. officials said Saturday. It was the deadliest single loss for American forces in the decade-old war against the Taliban.

One current and one former U.S. official said that the dead included 25 Navy SEALs from SEAL Team Six, the unit that carried out the raid in Pakistan in May that killed bin Laden. They were being flown by a crew of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because families are still being notified.

A total number of 38 people died in the crash, killing 7 Afghans and one interpreter.

""We don't believe that any of the special operators who were killed were involved in the bin Laden operation,"" a senior U.S. military official told Fox News.

President Barack Obama mourned the deaths of the American troops, saying in a statement that the crash serves as a reminder of the ""extraordinary sacrifices"" being made by the U.S. military and its families. He said he also mourned ""the Afghans who died alongside our troops.""

The death toll would surpass the worst single day loss of life for the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan since the war began in 2001 -- the June 28, 2005 downing of a military helicopter in eastern Kunar province. In that incident, 16 Navy SEALs and Army special operations troops were killed when their craft was shot down while on a mission to rescue four SEALs under attack by the Taliban. Three of the SEALs being rescued were also killed and the fourth wounded. It was the highest one-day death toll for the Navy Special Warfare personnel since World War II.

The Taliban claimed they downed the helicopter with rocket fire while it was taking part in a raid on a house where insurgents were gathered in the province of Wardak late Friday. It said wreckage of the craft was strewn at the scene. A senior U.S. administration official in Washington said the craft was apparently shot down by insurgents. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the crash is still being investigated.

NATO confirmed the overnight crash took place and that there ""was enemy activity in the area."" But it said it was still investigating the cause and conducting a recovery operation at the site. It did not release details or casualty figures.

""We are in the process of accessing the facts,"" said U.S. Air Force Capt. Justin Brockhoff, a NATO spokesman.

With its steep mountain ranges, providing shelter for militants armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers, eastern Afghanistan is hazardous terrain for military aircraft. Large, slow-moving air transport carriers like the CH-47 Chinook are particularly vulnerable, often forced to ease their way through sheer valleys where insurgents can achieve more level lines of fire from mountainsides.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Saturday gave the first public word of the new crash, saying in a statement that ""a NATO helicopter crashed last night in Wardak province"" and that 31 American special operations troops were killed. He expressed his condolences to President Barack Obama.

The helicopter was a twin-rotor Chinook, said an official at NATO headquarters in Brussels. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was receiving his information from an Afghan officer in Kabul.

The volatile region of Wardak borders the province of Kabul where the Afghan capital is located and is known for its strong Taliban presence.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in a statement that Taliban fighters downed the helicopter during a ""heavy raid"" in Sayd Abad. He said NATO attacked a house in Sayd Abad where insurgent fighters were gathering Friday night. During the battle, the fighters shot down the helicopter, killing 31 Americans and seven Afghans, he said, adding that eight insurgents were killed in the fight.

There have been at least 17 coalition and Afghan aircraft crashes in Afghanistan this year.

Most of the crashes were attributed to pilot errors, weather conditions or mechanical failures. However, the coalition has confirmed that at least one CH-47F Chinook helicopter was hit by a rocket propelled grenade on July 25. Two coalition crew members were injured in that attack.

Meanwhile, in the southern Helmand province, an Afghan government official said Saturday that NATO troops attacked a house and inadvertently killed eight members of a family, including women and children.

NATO said that Taliban fighters fired rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire at coalition troops during a patrol Friday in the Nad Ali district.

""Coalition forces responded with small arms fire and as the incident continued, an air strike was employed against the insurgent position,"" said Brockhoff. He added that NATO sent a delegation to meet with local leaders and investigate the incident.

Nad Ali district police chief Shadi Khan said civilians died in the bombardment but that it was unknown how many insurgents were killed.

Helmand, a Taliban stronghold, is the deadliest province in Afghanistan for international troops.

NATO has come under harsh criticism in the past for accidentally killing civilians during operations against suspected insurgents. However, civilian death tallies by the United Nations show the insurgency is responsible for most war casualties involving noncombatants.

In south Afghanistan, NATO said two coalition service member were killed, one on Friday and another on Saturday. The international alliance did not release further details.

With the casualties from the helicopter crash, the deaths bring to 365 the number of coalition troops killed this year in Afghanistan and 42 this month.

"A U.N. commission tasked with investigating battles in Syria has accused the Assad regime and affiliated militias of carrying out war crimes as it released a damning report Wednesday highlighting atrocities that have “collectively displaced more than one million men, women and children.”

The 24-page document by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic focuses on happenings inside Syria between January and July of this year. It is based on hundreds of interviews, satellite images, videos, medical records and government communications during that time period, among other sources.

""The Commission finds that pro-government forces committed the war crimes of deliberately attacking protected objects, intentionally attacking medical personnel and using prohibited weapons, and that, on four occasions, pro-government forces did not direct attacks at a specific military objective, which amounted to the war crime of launching indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas,” the report says.

GERMANY IN TALKS WITH US ON POSSIBLY JOINING AIRSTRIKES IN SYRIA IN THE EVENT OF CHEMICAL ATTACK: REPORT

""On 4 February, at approximately 9 p.m., Government helicopters dropped at least two barrels carrying chlorine payloads in the Taleel area of Saraqeb,"" another excerpt of the report says.

On April 7, “numerous aerial attacks were carried out in Douma, striking various residential areas,” it adds.

“A vast body of evidence collected by the Commission suggests that, at approximately 7.30 p.m., a gas cylinder containing a chlorine payload delivered by helicopter struck a multi-story residential apartment building,” the report continues, noting that the attacks left at least 49 people dead that day and wounded another 650.

The report also cites chemical weapon use in Ghouta, outside the Syrian capital of Damascus.

""In an unprecedented development during the period under review, warring parties carried out battles in Aleppo, northern Homs, Damascus, Rif Damascus, Dara’a and Idlib governorates, which collectively displaced more than 1 million Syrian men, women and children,” it says.

Meanwhile, government forces have been massing troops on the edge of Idlib in preparation for an offensive on the last major rebel stronghold in Syria, according to the Associated Press.

""Idlib should not become the next massacre, the final massacre in the battles in Syria and common sense now needs to prevail,"" Commissioner Hanny Megally told reporters after the release of the report. The civilian population ""should not be held hostage to a war on terror.""

U.N. Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura said last month that 10,000 Al Qaeda-linked fighters and their families are located in the densely populated region, which is now home to 2.9 million people. Many of those have been displaced from other parts of Syria in recent years.

Commission Chair Paulo Pinheiro said the presence of 3 million civilians in the area is ""something that has to move the powers involved in the decision.""

""You are fighting 10,000 armed people, terrorists, and the 3 million population will be the price to fight,"" said Pinheiro. ""Of course we don't have anything against fighting terrorists but something has to be done to protect the rights of the 3 million people and (including) 1 million children.""

""All the other disasters would be minor events compared to what can happen in Idlib,"" he said.

The White House warned Assad last week that if he chooses to use chemical weapons in the offensive against Idlib, the U.S. and its allies ""will respond swiftly and appropriately.""

"Arlington National Cemetery returned to its roots as a resting place for the Civil War dead with a burial Thursday of two unknown Union soldiers.

The burials marked the dedication of an $87 million expansion of the cemetery that officials hope will extend the cemetery's life by up to 10 years.

The so-called Millennium expansion adds 27 acres and more than 27,000 spaces for burials and cremated remains to a cemetery where more than 400,000 are already interred.

Without the Millennium project, Arlington would run out of gravesites as soon as 15 years from now. The expansion should extend the cemetery's lifespan into the early 2040s, said David Fedroff, deputy chief of engineering at Arlington.

Another expansion in planning stages is hoped to extend the cemetery's life beyond 2050. In addition, the Army, which runs the cemetery, has conducted surveys to determine whether the public is willing to support tighter restrictions on eligibility for burial at Arlington that could extend the lifespan even further.

The two Union soldiers buried Thursday at Arlington with full military honors were recently discovered at Manassas National Battlefield in what appeared to be a surgeon's pit filled with severed limbs from 11 other soldiers. When the National Park Service announced the discovery in June, officials said it was the first time that a surgeon's pit at a Civil War battlefield had been excavated and studied.

The decision was made at the time to bury the two complete sets of remains at Arlington. While the soldiers could not be completely identified, experts determined from the location of the pit and from items found inside that the two soldiers were Union Army members who died at the Second Battle of Bull Run in 1862.

Karen Durham-Aguilera, executive director of Army National Military Cemeteries, told a crowd of several hundred gathered for Thursday's ceremony that it was fitting to dedicate a new section of the cemetery with burial of Civil War soldiers.

The cemetery was born during the Civil War when the Union Army needed a place to bury the increasing numbers of killed soldiers. It appropriated the estate owned by the family of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee on a bluff overlooking the Potomac River in occupied Virginia for burying Union soldiers.

""Now, 154 years later, all of us share in a similar experience,"" she said.

Of the 27,282 interment spaces connected with the Millennium expansion, more than 16,000 are columbarium niches for cremated remains. Cemetery officials said the ratio was dictated both by the topography and the cemetery's needs.

The section, which provides a view of the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument, includes more than 6,000 pre-placed concrete grave liners, which eliminate the need for extensive digging at each burial. The pre-placed liners also conserve space, requiring only a 3-by-8 foot footprint compared to 5-by-10 feet in older sections of the cemetery.

Cemetery officials expect to conduct up to three funeral services a day in the new section. They say the new space gives them more flexibility to schedule the up-to-30 services a day conducted at Arlington.

""This gives us some operational separation and some flexibility to make the experience special for families"" mourning the loss of a loved one, Fedroff said.",world
"A Texas woman is criticizing the two-year sentence an illegal immigrant received for killing her husband and two youngest children in a car crash last year.

Courtney Hacking told “Fox & Friends” Saturday that the sentence in a Texas state court doesn’t compensate her for the loss of her 36-year-old husband Peter, a volunteer firefighter, 4-year-old daughter Ellie and 22-month-old son Grayson in the accident.

“People think his crime and his punishment seem to fit because he was an illegal immigrant,” she said, referring to Mexican Margarito Quintero Rosales who pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide in connection with the crash. “But to me being illegal in the country was a crime on its own so I don’t understand how he did get only two years.”

She added, “To me I take it offensively. I take it personally.”

Cops say Quintero swerved into Hacking’s vehicle which was coming the other way when he fell asleep at the wheel, WFAA-TV reported.

The sentencing took place Sept. 29. The sentence was the maximum under state law, the station reported.

Quintero has been jailed since the accident. He will complete the sentence in about another 110 days.

He is serving that sentence as he serves a two-year federal sentence for reentering the U.S. illegally after being deported. Court records show he was charged with that crime after the accident and sentenced last month.

Quintero was also arrested after the crash for having no driver’s license, the Dallas Morning News reported.

Peter Hacking was driving Ellie and Grayson home after picking them up at the babysitter, according to the paper.

“I want our laws enforced,” Hacking said on “Fox & Friends.”

“The message needs to be put across to them that when you come to this country you need to do it legally because when they come here all they’re getting is…they’re committing crimes, they’re getting a slap on the wrist and they’re going back to Mexico or they’re going back to whatever country they came from.”

Her husband was a legal immigrant from England, she said.

Hacking is now caring for her other four children alone.

She said she each day she sees Ellie and Grayson’s beautiful faces from the moment she wakes up to the moment she goes to bed.

“I miss their kisses,” she said. “I miss everything about them on a daily basis.”",world
"Pope Francis accepted the resignation of an American bishop accused of sexually harassing adults and assigned another bishop to investigate the matter, Vatican officials announced Thursday amid a wave of scandals enveloping leaders within the Catholic Church.

News of the investigation came as a meeting was underway between Francis and U.S. cardinals and bishops to discuss allegations involving a former American cardinal.

Michael Bransfield, the West Virginia bishop who resigned Thursday, had been implicated in 2012 in a Philadelphia priestly sex abuse case, but he denied ever abusing anyone and claimed vindication years ago, according to The Associated Press. He continued with his ministry until he offered to retire, as required, when he turned 75 last week.

The Vatican announced Francis accepted his resignation at the exact moment the U.S. delegation was arriving at the Apostolic Palace for the meeting with the pope.

Francis appointed Baltimore Bishop William Lori to take over Bransfield's Wheeling-Charleston diocese temporarily. Lori said in a statement that Francis had also instructed him to ""conduct an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment of adults against Bishop Bransfield.""

“My primary concern is for the care and support of the priests and people of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston at this difficult time,” Lori said in a statement. “I further pledge to conduct a thorough investigation in search of the truth into the troubling allegations against Bishop Bransfield and to work closely with the clergy, religious and lay leaders of the diocese until the appointment of a new bishop.”

In past court cases involving Bransfield, church officials and witnesses accused him of molesting teenage boys – a claim that Bransfield has denied, according to the Washington Post.

Lori also set up a hotline for potential victims to call.

The Bransfield revelation comes in the wake of the June 20 announcement that one of the most prestigious U.S. cardinals, Theodore McCarrick, had been accused of groping a teen-age altar boy in the 1970s.

Francis removed McCarrick as a cardinal in July after a U.S. church investigation found the allegation credible. After news broke of the investigation, several former seminarians and priests came forward to report that they too had been abused or harassed by McCarrick as adults.

The head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Houston Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, had requested the papal audience last month following revelations that McCarrick had risen through church ranks even though the allegations of sexual misconduct were known in U.S. and Vatican circles, The Associated Press reported.

DiNardo requested a full-fledged Vatican investigation into the McCarrick affair, and said he also wanted answers to allegations that a string of Vatican officials -- including Pope Francis -- knew of McCarrick's misdeeds but turned a blind eye.

The Vatican hasn't responded to allegations by its former ambassador to the U.S., Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, that Francis effectively rehabilitated McCarrick from sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI over allegations McCarrick would routinely invite seminarians to his beach house and into his bed.

Francis, however, has responded to the overall scandal with a series of initiatives aimed at trying to convince the faithful he ""gets it"" and is prepared to take measures to put an end to what he has called the ""culture of cover-up"" in the church.

On the eve of the U.S. audience, Francis announced he was summoning the presidents of bishops conferences around the world to a February summit to discuss prevention measures and protection of minors and vulnerable adults.

The surprise announcement was largely dismissed as a belated damage control effort by victims' advocates. Church historians questioned why such an urgent problem was being scheduled for discussion six months from now with the very bishops who are blamed for much of the scandal.

""Where are the laity and others who might provide both new and uncomplicit voices and insights into the process?"" Margaret Susan Thompson, associate professor of history at Syracuse University, told The Associated Press in an interview.

Even DiNardo's own record on protecting children has now come into question. On the eve of his audience with Francis, The Associated Press reported two victims in Houston had accused him of not doing enough to stop a priest who was arrested this week on sexual abuse charges.

The archdiocese issued a statement Wednesday confirming that both people had come forward to report abuse by the priest, the Rev. Manuel LaRosa-Lopez, including one of them in 2001. The priest is now the pastor at St. John Fisher Catholic Church in Richmond while also serving as the archdiocese's episcopal vicar for Hispanics.

The delegation of U.S. bishops announced no plans to speak to the media after their audience.

"A U.S. Navy pilot received the Distinguished Flying Cross for shooting down a Syrian jet in 2017 — the first air-to-air kill for the U.S. military in 18 years.

The F-18 Super Hornet pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Mike “MOB” Tremel, shot down a Syrian government warplane after it attacked Washington-backed fighters near ISIS’ de facto capital of Raqqa in June 2017, as Fox News previously reported.

Tremel is a graduate of the Navy’s premier fighter weapons school — known as “Top Gun” — and a 2004 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy.

His F/A-18E Super Hornet shot down a Syrian Su-22 that had dropped bombs near positions held by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The U.S.-led coalition aircraft had “conducted a show of force” to turn back an attack by Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s forces on the SDF in the town of Ja’Din, south of Tabqah.

The medal is awarded for heroism or extraordinary achievement during aerial flights, as Military.com has reported. “It was an absolute team effort,” said Tremel, noting his valor wasn’t solo.

“Our whole mission out there was to defeat (the Islamic State group), annihilate ISIS,” he said. “At any point in time, if this had deescalated, that would have been great. We would have gotten mission success and (gone) back to continue to drop bombs on ISIS.”

The award was presented by the head of naval aviation, Vice Admiral DeWolfe Miller III, at the Tailhook Association’s annual convention at the Nugget Casino Resort in Nevada over the weekend.",world

Nikulshina said Verzilov had been in emergency care since Tuesday and was being treated in a toxicology unit at a Moscow hospital, an indication that poisoning was suspected.

In July, Verzilov, Nikulshina and two other activists disrupted the match between Croatia and France during the World Cup final when they ran onto the field wearing police uniforms in to protest excessive police powers in Russia.

"Slovenia is set to vote into office Thursday a new, center-left government that will keep away from power anti-immigrant populists who topped June's election.

The proposed government of Prime Minister Marjan Sarec — a former comedian — comprises several moderate groups which have joined forces to sideline the right-wing winner of the June 3 parliamentary vote.

A novice in Slovenia's top politics, the 40-year-old Sarec has proposed a minority government consisting of five center-left parties. It will also get the backing of a separate left-wing group in parliament.

If confirmed, Sarec's moderate government bucks the trend in Central Europe where populists have swept to power in elections from Italy to Poland.

Slovenia was once part of the former Yugoslavia and is the native home of U.S. first lady Melania Trump. Bordering Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Italy and a slice of the Adriatic Sea, the country joined the European Union in 2004 and has used the euro as its official currency since 2007.

Some analysts in Slovenia have predicted that Sarec's government will be unstable because it consists of several diverse groups and depends for its ability to pass legislation on the left-wing party.

Already, Slovenian businesses have expressed fear that support from The Left party, which advocated welfare state in Slovenia, will force the government to raise taxes to meet its demands.

Sarec, who gave up performing on stage to become the mayor of the central Slovenian town of Kamnik, told parliament that his government is ready to take up its responsibilities.

""It is easier to observe from the side and criticize than to do something,"" he said. ""It is time to start working now.""

Though the Slovenian Democratic Party of former prime minister, Janez Jansa, topped June's election, it failed to garner enough support to govern alone. Other parliamentary groups in the traditionally moderate Alpine nation have refused to cooperate with Jansa, who is an ally of Hungary's anti-immigrant Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Janez Markes, an analyst from the Delo newspaper, predicted that Jansa will provide stiff opposition to Sarec's government.

""This is the government against something ... so I suppose this government is going to be a little bit colorless,"" Markes said. ""But this minority (government) can last, maybe for four years, who knows.""

"FEMA associate director Jeffrey Byard isn’t mincing words.

His tough talk ahead of Hurricane Florence’s multi-state assault is part of a strategy to get as many people as possible in the storm’s path to move to higher ground.

When Florence was downgraded from a Category-3 storm to a Category-2 on Thursday, Byard offered up some options to people still on the fence.

His colorful quotes and blunt warnings are crafted to be as piercing as possible so residents at risk will get out of dodge.

“We call them disasters because they break things.” Byard said. “The infrastructure is going to break.”

The National Weather Center has described Florence as “the storm of a lifetime” and a “major flooding event.”

Florence is already spreading rain and wind into the Carolinas with landfall likely coming sometime overnight or on Friday. The devastation could linger into next week, producing catastrophic flooding, life-threatening storm surge and ferocious winds.

"The two men Britain has accused in the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter claimed Thursday they were merely tourists in the area where the incident occurred.

Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov told the state-backed RT station that they were visiting the United Kingdom in March when they went on a brief sightseeing jaunt to Salisbury, according to The Daily Mail.

“We arrived in Salisbury on March 3 and tried to walk through the town, but we lasted for only half an hour because it was covered in snow,” Petrov said. “Of course, we went there to see Stonehenge but we couldn't do it because there was muddy slush everywhere. We got wet, took the nearest train and came back [to London].”

The pair spent no more than an hour in Salisbury because of the train times, Boshirov added.

Britain named Petrov and Boshirov as the two men suspected of poisoning Sergei Skirpal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, and said the duo work for Russian military intelligence.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, on Wednesday denied the men worked for the military. Putin said Russian officials “know who these people are” and called on the two men to talk to the media and “tell about themselves.”

Skripal and his daughter were found unconscious on a shopping mall bench on March 4 in Salisbury, a city about 90 miles west of London. The pair were released from the hospital two months later and moved to a private, secure location.

The nerve agent used to poison the Skripals was smuggled to Britain in a counterfeit Nina Ricci perfume bottle and applied to the front door of their house, according to Metropolitan Police.

A British couple with no known ties to Russia were also later poisoned by the same substance in Salisbury.

Police believe Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner, 45-year-old Charlie Rowley, had accidentally found the Novichok-laced perfume bottle, exposing them to the toxic nerve agent. Sturgess died more than a week later, while Rowley remains in critical but stable condition.

After the Skripals were poisoned, Britain and more than two dozen other countries expelled a total of 150 Russians who were allegedly spies working under diplomatic cover. Russia kicked out a similar number of those countries' diplomatic envoys.

"The United States accused Russia on Thursday of pressuring an independent panel of U.N. experts to alter a report on sanctions against North Korea that included alleged sanctions violations ""implicating Russian actors.""

U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley expressed disappointment in the panel monitoring sanctions against North Korea ""for caving to Russian pressure and making changes to what should have been an independent report."" She called it ""a stain"" on the experts' important work.

Haley said the panel should release the original report, which cited ""a massive increase in illicit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products"" for North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions. It said some products allegedly were off-loaded from Russian ships.

Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said in late August that he put a hold on the report's release ""because we disagree with certain elements"" that he refused to disclose.

A summary of the experts report obtained in early August by The Associated Press also said North Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile programs. And it said North Korea is violating sanctions by transferring coal at sea and flouting an arms embargo and financial sanctions.

The dispute between Russia and the U.S as well as Western and other Security Council members has delayed the official release of the six-month report by the expert panel monitoring sanctions against North Korea.

After the initial experts' report was released, Russia and China blocked the U.N. from imposing sanctions on Russia-based entities and vessels sanctioned a week earlier by the U.S. Treasury Department.

The Russian news agency TASS quoted Russia's U.N. Mission as saying the proposed sanctions were ""unjustified.""

The Security Council has remained united in imposing tougher and tougher sanctions on North Korea, but the differences over the experts' report mark a first dent in that unity.

U.N. diplomats familiar with discussions said Russia was angered that the panel used a lot of U.S. intelligence in the initial report that Moscow claimed was incorrect. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because talks were private.

"French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday formally recognized the responsibility of the French state in the death of a dissident mathematician in Algeria in 1957, admitting for the first time the French military's ""system"" that included torture during Algeria's independence war.

Macron visited on Thursday the 87-year-old widow of Maurice Audin, a French anti-colonial activist who disappeared after his arrest. He asked for her pardon, announced the opening of French archives on the war and expressed hope a new era would dawn for often-bitter French-Algerian relations.

Audin, a French communist mathematician, was arrested in 1957 by the French military during the battle of Algiers. His body has never been recovered, but historians widely believe he was tortured — which Macron acknowledged, a major break with France's official version of the war.

""The only thing I am doing is to acknowledge the truth,"" Macron told Josette Audin.

Maurice Audin has become the symbol of France's abuses during the brutal war in its former colony that ended with Algeria's independence in 1962. A square in Algiers bears his name and his widow's battle to uncover the truth made his case a cause celebre.

The scars of the seven-year war have yet to heal in Algeria or in France. Unlike other French colonies, Algeria, which France invaded in 1830, was part of the French nation, a colonial jewel.

Both the occupation and the brutality during the war have embittered ties between Algiers and Paris. French authorities did not refer to war at the time, calling the violence, disappearances and bloodshed an ""operation of public order.""

A declaration Macron gave to Josette Audin during his visit spelled out the method used by French soldiers to legally eliminate people like Audin, who clandestinely worked for the liberation of Algeria from the French.

Security forces were allowed to arrest, detain and interrogate all ""suspects"" through special powers accorded by parliament to the French Army that gave them carte-blanche to re-establish order.

""This system was the unfortunate ground for acts, sometimes terrible, including torture that the Audin affair has highlighted,"" the declaration says, adding that it made torture a ""weapon considered legitimate.""

Torture wasn't punished ""because it was conceived as an arm against the FLN"" — the National Liberation Front fighting for Algeria's independence — ""but also against anyone seen as its allies, militants and partisans of independence.""

Historians have long studied the disappearance of Audin and widely concluded he was tortured after his arrest at his home the evening of June 11, 1957.

Macron announced that France will open its archives, telling Audin's widow that ""everyone should know the truth.""

Macron's predecessor, Francois Hollande, had previously acknowledged that Audin didn't escape — the official version of events until then — but died in jail.

"A top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Thursday that he was taking a leave of absence amid an uproar over allegations of sexual assault.

David Keyes, Netanyahu's spokesman with the foreign press, issued a statement saying that ""in order not to distract from the important work of the Prime Minister, I have asked to take time off to clear my name. I am fully confident that the truth will come out.""

Julia Salazar, a candidate for New York's state senate, accuses Keyes of sexually assaulting her five years ago. Others have since come forward. Wall Street Journal reporter Shayndi Raice tweeted she too had a ""terrible encounter"" with Keyes. She described someone who had ""absolutely no conception of the word 'no.'""

Keyes has denied the allegations, saying all ""are deeply misleading and many of them are categorically false.""

At least four female Israeli lawmakers called upon Netanyahu to suspend Keyes after the allegations surfaced earlier this week.

The women called on Netanyahu to intervene and condemn the alleged actions by Keyes, saying his spokesman could not be effective as he battles the allegations.

Netanyahu's office hasn't commented on the matter.

Among the Knesset members calling for a suspension was one member of Netanyahu's governing coalition. Merav Ben Ari, a Kulanu party parliament member, said was ""unreasonable"" that Keyes remained in his position.

Michal Rozin, a legislator with the opposition Meretz party, said Keyes can no longer represent Israel to the world. She said Netanyahu's silence thus far could also be interpreted as tolerance of the alleged acts.

Keyes has served as Netanyahu's spokesman to the foreign media since 2016. He is considered a close aide to the prime minister and deeply involved in Netanyahu's social media policy. Netanyahu rarely speaks to the media, preferring instead to deliver his messages in tightly controlled video clips released on Facebook and Twitter.",world

The Latest on the sex abuse and cover-up scandal rocking the Vatican (all times local):

4:25 p.m.

The head of the U.S. delegation that met with Pope Francis over the growing sex abuse and cover-up scandal says the U.S. church and Vatican will work together to determine the next steps.

A statement Thursday from the head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, made no mention of his earlier plans to ask Francis to authorize a Vatican investigation into the case of now-disgraced ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, accused of sexual misconduct with minors and adults.

DiNardo headed a four-member delegation that met with the pope Thursday. His statement said the group told Francis the U.S. church was ""lacerated by the evil of sexual abuse.""

He said they prayed for mercy and strength to heal wounds and said: ""We look forward to actively continuing our discernment together identifying the most effective next steps.""

The Vatican has authorized an investigation into a U.S. bishop accused of sexual harassment of adults.

The decision comes on the same day a U.S. delegation met with the pope over the latest chapter in the Catholic Church's long-running sex abuse and cover-up scandal.

The Vatican announced that Pope Francis had accepted the resignation of West Virginia Bishop Michael Bransfield, and had named a temporary administrator for his Wheeling-Charleston diocese.

A delegation of U.S. Catholic cardinals and bishops is having an audience with Pope Francis amid a crisis of confidence in church leadership following sex abuse and cover-up revelations that have also implicated Francis himself.

Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, requested the audience last month following revelations that a now-disgraced ex-cardinal, Theodore McCarrick, had risen through church ranks despite allegations of sexual misconduct that were known in U.S. and Vatican circles.

DiNardo followed up his request for a full-fledged Vatican investigation into the McCarrick affair with a request for answers about allegations that a string of Vatican officials — including Francis — knew of McCarrick's misdeeds since 2000.

A group of 19 Greek and foreign charities have sharply criticized the continuously deteriorating conditions in migrant camps on eastern Aegean islands, calling on Greek authorities to tackle severe overcrowding and staff shortages.

In their joint statement released Thursday, the NGOs singled out conditions in the Moria camp on the island of Lesbos and the camp on the island of Samos, respectively about three and six times over capacity.

The criticism comes days after the regional governor threatened to shut down Moria unless the government takes action within a month to improve conditions, which she said included raw sewage running out of the camp's main entrance.

"Kosovo's president has urged political parties to work faster to unite behind a strategy to smooth ties with Serbia, which he called the only way for Kosovo to join the European Union.

Hashim Thaci on Thursday called on politicians to reach a consensus soon on the government's negotiating team, a move strongly opposed by the opposition so far.

Brussels has made it clear the EU will not accept Kosovo and Serbia if they don't resolve their conflict.

Thaci said tough talks were ahead as the countries are set to negotiate on a 430-kilometer (270-mile) long border demarcation.

""There will be no bilateral recognition without concluding such a process,"" he said.

Opposition parties have turned down Thaci's recent suggestion of a ""border correction,"" or a land swap with Serbia to resolve the border dispute.

Some Kosovo and Serbian officials have proposed a deal based on where ethnic Serb and Albanian minorities are concentrated — Kosovo's northern Mitrovica region for Serbia's Presevo Valley.

Thaci has opposed Kosovo's territorial division but has not clarified how Serbia would agree to give Presevo Valley without something in exchange.

On Wednesday Kosovo's opposition political parties sent a letter to the EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini saying that Thaci ""does not represent us, nor the people of Kosovo in this process.""

They said any territorial swap or change is ""dangerous for peace in the region and therefore are unacceptable.""

Serbia doesn't recognize Kosovo's 2008 independence, declared nine years after NATO intervened in the 1998-99 war to stop an onslaught by then-Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic against Kosovo ethnic Albanian separatists.

Both countries hope the seven-year long EU-facilitated dialogue to normalize ties will reach a final stage with a bilateral, legally binding agreement.

"Colombia's last-remaining rebel group freed six people it took captive last month amid demands from President Ivan Duque that it release all hostages and cease kidnapping in order for peace talks to resume.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said it took part in the humanitarian mission Wednesday in western Choco department. There were no other immediate details.

Duque suspended peace talks with the National Liberation Army, or ELN, upon taking office a month ago, insisting that for negotiations to resume the rebels must stop all criminal activity, including kidnappings and attacks on oil pipelines.

The conservative leader showed little interest in softening his position as news of the release emerged. While celebrating that the captives would soon be reunited with loved ones, he called his predecessor's decision to negotiate with rebels even as they continued to carry out attacks a ""historic mistake"" that he would not repeat.

""If there is a genuine desire for peace, the government will be there,"" Duque said in a speech in the southern city of Pasto. But ""if we want to build peace with this armed group they need to begin by stating clearly that they will suspend all criminal activities.""

The three police officers, army soldier and two civilian contractors were taken captive more than a month ago when the small boat they were traveling on was intercepted by a guerrillas belonging to the ELN who were patrolling a remote river in western Colombia.

Authorities said the group was dressed in civilian clothing and returning a rural zone where members of another rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, had demobilized as part of a 2016 peace deal.

The government maintains that the ELN is holding another 10 civilian hostages. The rebels haven't confirmed that number.

The ELN has said it will only cease attacks if the government agrees to a bilateral ceasefire.

The ELN was created in 1964 by a group of Catholic priests and Marxist activists inspired by the Cuban revolution. It has approximately 1,500 fighters and it became the country's last remaining guerrilla group after the much-larger FARC disbanded as part of the peace deal with Duque's predecessor.

Former President Juan Manuel Santos began peace talks with the ELN that have yielded few commitments so far. The talks were suspended at the beginning of this year after the rebel group broke a bilateral ceasefire that had lasted for three months, but they resumed in May even while fighting between the government and the ELN continued.",world
"The United States is seeking Security Council approval for a resolution to toughen U.N. action against peacekeepers that fail to protect civilians, including by sending them home and refusing to pay their governments.

The United Nations, which deploys 96,000 peacekeepers in 14 missions from the Mideast and Africa to Haiti and India-Pakistan's disputed Kashmir region, has come under sharp criticism for sexual abuse by its troops and failures to protect civilians.

U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley told a council meeting Wednesday that the key to peacekeeping is trust between the protected and the protectors, and when that is gone the mission will fail.

""Even worse than failures to protect are instances in which civilians have been attacked, abused, and exploited by the peacekeepers who are supposed to protect them,"" she said.

Haley said the draft resolution aims ""to empower the U.N. Secretariat and accelerate progress on improving peacekeeper performance.""

It mandates timely reporting of ""performance failures,"" creates ""accountability measures for failures of performance and concrete incentives for stronger performance,"" and recognizes ""the role of data in improving troop performance,"" she said.

The United States is the largest contributor to peacekeeping and Haley has been trying to cut its budget, which this year is $7.3 billion. She announced in March that the U.S. was cutting its 28.5 percent assessment to 25 percent.

Countries that contribute troops to U.N. missions have privately expressed unhappiness at the U.S. draft resolution. Russia and China say the views of troop contributors need to be taken into account, and Russia told the council Wednesday it would support a weaker council statement on peacekeeper performance — not a legally binding resolution.

Haley told the council that the draft resolution mandates timely reporting of ""performance failures,"" creates ""accountability measures for failures of performance and concrete incentives for stronger performance,"" and recognizes ""the role of data in improving troop performance.""

Bangladesh, a leading troop contributor currently to 11 peacekeeping missions, stressed that adequate resources and personnel are ""inextricably linked"" to performance.

And it warned that ""using alleged performance failures as grounds for cost-cutting and force reduction may help score political gains, but hardly responds to the interest of those peacekeeping missions are mandated to serve.""

Bangladesh and Pakistan, another top troop contributor, also stressed the importance of Security Council mandates being precise and achievable, with adequate funds and manpower. Pakistan noted, for example, that the peacekeeping mission in South Sudan ""is burdened with 209 tasks.""

Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia also stressed the importance of ""very clear mandates with emphasis on the political settlement.""

During the current strategic reviews of all peacekeeping missions, he said, ""what we need to do is clean up the mandates and make sure that we remove from them the peripheral human rights, humanitarian and social goals because all of these are goals for the host country.""

Nebenzia said the best platform for cooperation between the U.N. Secretariat, the Security Council and troop contributing countries is the Special Committee for Peacekeeping.

""We do not think that the council should bypass the (committee) and get involved in micro-management,"" he said.

Nebenzia said it will be important ""to send a political signal stating that the performance improvement of peacekeeping is a very important issue"" — but he said this could be done in a council statement.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has initiated a series of reforms to U.N. peacekeeping to respond to allegations of misconduct against peacekeepers. These include a victims' advocate to help victims of sexual abuse.

U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix stressed that improvements are a collective endeavor and the reforms are ""ultimately about performance.""

""Much work remains to be done, but we are beginning to see the effects of our collective efforts,"" he said.

He noted that the number of peacekeeping deaths between January and Aug. 31 fell from 26 in 2017 to 17 this year, 55 countries have signed on to a declaration on enhanced peacekeeping measures, and new U.N. requirements on acting on sexual abuse cases have led to a decrease in the time governments are taking for investigations.",world

"A former police officer in an Ohio village was sentenced Wednesday to 43 years in prison for sexually assaulting four women while on duty, including two women he had taken to the police station.

Sanderson, an officer in the Montgomery County village of Phillipsburg, said in court that he still considers himself innocent, the Dayton Daily News reported. Judge Steven Dankof, who found him guilty of rape, kidnapping and gross sexual imposition during a bench trial in late August, said it was the court's ""darkest voyage"" into a man's actions.

The women said Sanderson came to their room in uniform, told them he was investigating human trafficking and prostitution, and gave them a warning.

They said Sanderson left, returned a short time later and had sex with them. They told police they thought they had no choice because he was a police officer, prosecutors said.

His arrest prompted two other women to step forward, prosecutors said. One woman said Sanderson stopped her for drunken driving in May 2017 and forced her to have sex at the police station, while a second woman said she was forced into sexual conduct after her arrest on a warrant.

Sanderson resigned from the department in July 2017, the prosecutor's office said.

""This defendant used his authority as a police officer to force four victims into sexual activity,"" Heck said. ""Not only will he never be in a position of authority in the future, but he will be unable to victimize anyone else.""

South Sudan's warring parties on Wednesday signed what they say is the final peace agreement to end the country's five-year civil war, which has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions.

Several preliminary agreements have already been signed but both sides say this is the concluding version.

President Salva Kiir and head of the opposition, Riek Machar as well as the other opposition parties signed the ""final final"" deal in neighboring Ethiopia, government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told The Associated Press. He said the agreement is acceptable to all parties and noted that Kiir and Machar had an amicable chat after the signing.

""The president was interacting very well with Riek Machar ... he was talking to him in a very friendly way,"" said Ateny.

The latest signing comes following weeks of negotiations in Khartoum, Sudan, on outstanding issues between the factions. While the government is optimistic about the new deal, many international observers remain skeptical.

""We remain concerned about the parties' level of commitment to this agreement and to the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement,"" said a statement on Wednesday by the UK, the U.S. and Norway, the troika that worked to bring South Sudan to independence in 2011. To be convinced of both sides' the commitment to peace, they need to see a significant change in approach, said the three countries in a statement, indicating they want to see an end to the violence, full humanitarian access given to aid workers, the release of political prisoners and see checks on executive and majority power and the transparent use of resources.

A Washington-based advocacy group also questioned the deal.

"As U.S. Catholic leaders head to the Vatican to meet with Pope Francis about a growing church abuse crisis, the cardinal leading the delegation has been accused by two people of not doing enough to stop a priest who was arrested this week on sexual abuse charges.

The two people told The Associated Press that they reported the priest and met with Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston. One of them says she was promised in a meeting with DiNardo, several years after she first reported abuse, that the priest would be removed from any contact with children, only to discover that the priest remained in active ministry at another parish 70 miles away.

The priest, Manuel LaRosa-Lopez, was arrested Tuesday by police in Conroe, Texas. Both people who spoke to the AP are cooperating with police.

The priest's arrest and allegations that DiNardo kept an abusive priest around children cast a shadow over a Thursday summit at the Vatican between Pope Francis and American bishops and cardinals. DiNardo is leading the delegation, putting him in the position of having to fend off abuse allegations in his own diocese while at the same time calling on the pope to get tougher on clergy abuse.

In addition to his responsibilities in Houston, DiNardo is head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, a position that has made him a prominent figure in the church's response to a new wave of allegations that Catholic leaders covered up sexual abuse. He has been outspoken in his calls for Pope Francis to investigate ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was removed from his post in July after a credible accusation that he groped a teenager.

DiNardo himself is now facing criticism for his role in handling a priest accused of abusing children.

LaRosa-Lopez, 60, is accused of fondling both people when they were teenagers and he was a priest at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Conroe. He is charged with four counts of indecency with a child. Each count carries a maximum possible sentence of 20 years in prison.

LaRosa-Lopez is now the pastor at St. John Fisher Catholic Church in Richmond while also serving as the archdiocese's episcopal vicar for Hispanics.

The archdiocese issued a statement Wednesday confirming that both people had come forward to report abuse by LaRosa-Lopez, one of them in 2001. The archdiocese said it reported both allegations to the state Child Protective Services, and said it was unaware of any other ""allegations of inappropriate conduct involving minors"" against the priest. A spokesman for CPS on Wednesday declined to comment, citing confidentiality of the reports. LaRosa-Lopez did not immediately return a phone message left Wednesday.

""To anyone affected by any form of abuse by anyone who represents the Church, the Archdiocese deeply regrets such a fundamental violation of trust, and commits itself to eliminating such unacceptable actions,"" the archdiocese said.

Both accusers who say they went to DiNardo are now in their 30s. The Associated Press typically does not identify victims in sexual abuse cases, and both people asked that their names be withheld.

One was flown by the church from the West Coast to Houston to meet with DiNardo and the victims' assistance coordinator for the archdiocese. They met at the archdiocese on the afternoon of Aug. 10, just as he was taking on a greater role nationally in responding to the McCarrick saga.

The man wrote down notes from the meeting quickly after leaving, and shared a copy of the notes with AP.

""Cardinal seemed dismissive of situation,"" the notes read. He also wrote down what he says is a quote from DiNardo: ""You should have told us sooner.""

""It was a dismissive tone,"" he recalled. ""In the back of my head, I was thinking about his comment. I was so mad afterward.""

Both said they had believed their cases would be too old to prosecute under statute of limitations laws. But the Texas Legislature in 2007 removed the statute of limitations for indecency with a child cases. Montgomery County prosecutors say that change means their cases remain eligible to be prosecuted now.

The group Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, has called for the Texas attorney general to investigate the Houston archdiocese and others for whether they covered up sexual abuse in their ranks.

""DiNardo needs to come clean on what he knows,"" said Michael Norris, a member of SNAP.

Both victims say they were teenagers when LaRosa-Lopez tried to befriend them over a period before initiating physical contact.

The male victim said he became interested as a teenager in joining the clergy and going to seminary. He started to attend Mass and got to know LaRosa-Lopez. Eventually, he got a job where he worked nights at Sacred Heart as an assistant.

He remembered LaRosa-Lopez being known as ""touchy-feely,"" and that the priest's contact with him became more physical over time: first touching on the arm, then hugging, then a kiss on the cheek.

One night, he said, the priest showed him pictures of young seminarians that ""he had a lot of fun with,"" and tried to take the teenager's clothes off and put his hands down his pants. He pushed back and quickly left the residence. He said he reported the incident to church authorities last year. The archdiocese said Wednesday it was ""formally presented"" with the allegation in August.

The female accuser said LaRosa-Lopez befriended her during her weekly confession at Sacred Heart. ""He basically was my only friend,"" she said.

The female victim declined to detail what LaRosa-Lopez did, saying only that he touched her inappropriately shortly before Easter, after she had turned 16.

She says her father found out what had happened and the family reported it to the church. Church officials told her that LaRosa-Lopez would be moved.

The archdiocese confirmed Wednesday that LaRosa-Lopez was re-assigned in 2001 to another church, St. Francis de Sales, and then moved in 2004 to St. John Fisher, his current assignment. It would not confirm he was moved due to an abuse complaint.

She eventually resumed going to her church with LaRosa-Lopez transferred to a new location.

But in 2010, she saw a copy of the archdiocese's internal newsletter, which announced LaRosa-Lopez's appointment as vicar of Hispanic ministry. She thought there was a chance DiNardo didn't know about her complaint because it had predated his time in Houston.

She contacted the church and started to meet with a therapist paid for by the archdiocese. Eventually, she met with DiNardo and other top clergy in the diocese. She says they told her that after she had come forward, LaRosa-Lopez was sent to a hospital for psychiatric treatment twice and that would no longer be allowed to work with children.

Then LaRosa-Lopez was brought in for about 10 minutes, she confronted him about the abuse and he apologized.

She says she later discovered that LaRosa-Lopez remained at St. John Fisher, in the presence of children.

Of DiNardo, the woman said, ""I'm tired of all of his empty words.""

""If he's going to go meet with the Pope and pretend that all of this is OK and his diocese is clean, I can't stand it,"" she said. ""I can't be quiet.""

The Associated Press asked Tuesday to interview DiNardo and other top leaders at the archdiocese. It also submitted a list of questions about both victims' allegations.

A spokesman for the archdiocese declined the interview requests or to address specific allegations about what DiNardo told the victims.

LaRosa-Lopez was not present at Mass in St. John Fisher on Saturday night or Sunday. A reporter who visited both days saw that a parking spot, marked with a sign reserving the space for ""Father Manuel,"" was empty.

Parishioners were told on Sunday morning Mass that LaRosa-Lopez was ""at a retreat.""",world
"A report on sexual abuse inside the Catholic Church in Germany says 3,677 people were abused by clergy between 1946 and 2014, two leading German media outlets said Wednesday.

Spiegel Online and Die Zeit said the report they obtained — commissioned by the German Bishops Conference and researched by three universities — concludes that more than half of the victims were 13 or younger and most were boys. Every sixth case involved rape and at least 1,670 clergy were involved, both weeklies reported. Die Zeit wrote that 969 abuse victims were altar boys.

The report also says that the actual number of victims was likely much higher, according to the research by experts from the Universities of Giessen, Heidelberg and Mannheim.

The German Bishops Conference said in a written response a few hours later that it regretted the leaking of the report, but that the study confirms “the extent of the sexual abuse” that took place.

“It is depressing and shameful for us,” Bishop Stephan Ackermann said. He didn’t further elaborate on the findings of the report, but said the Catholic group would present the study as initially planned on Sept. 25 together with the authors.

Die Zeit wrote that researchers weren’t allowed to look at the original church files but had to provide questionnaires to the dioceses, which then provided the information.

In their conclusions, the researchers write that there was evidence that some files were manipulated or destroyed, many cases were not brought to justice, and that sometimes abuse suspects — primarily priests — were simply moved to other dioceses without the congregations being informed about their past.

The Catholic Church has been struggling with sex abuse by its clergy for a long time.

In 2010, the German church was roiled by a sex abuse scandal triggered by the head of a Jesuit school in Berlin who went public about decades-long sexual abuse of high school students by clergy. Following that, a whole wave of victims who were sexually abused by clergy spoke out across the country.

An investigation in the United States last month found rampant sexual abuse of more than 1,000 children by about 300 Catholic priests in Pennsylvania.

Earlier this week, the Vatican said it is preparing the “necessary clarifications” about accusations that top Vatican officials including Pope Francis covered up the sexual misconduct of a now-disgraced American ex-cardinal.

Also on Wednesday, the Vatican said it’s summoning the presidents of every bishops’ conference around the world for a February summit to discuss preventing clergy sex abuse and protecting children.",world
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed new ""dramatic"" intelligence Monday which he claimed shows Iran is ""brazenly lying"" about its nuclear weapons program and shows the country is not complying with the vaunted nuclear deal it signed in 2015.

The information was obtained within the past 10 days, Israeli officials told Fox News. Netanyahu said the ""half a ton"" of files were moved to a ""highly secret"" location in Tehran after the deal was signed, and contained materials spread over 55,000 pages and 55,000 files on 183 CD's.

""These files conclusively prove that Iran is brazenly lying when it says it never had a nuclear weapons program,"" he said.

Netanyahu displayed what he said was ""an exact copy"" of the original materials, which are now in a ""very safe place"" and include incriminating documents, charts, presentations, blueprints, and photos.

Speaking during a nationally televised address, Israel's prime minister said the material is filled with incriminating evidence showing the Iranian program, called ""Project Amad,"" was to develop a weapon.

Netanyahu briefed President Trump about the intelligence on Saturday and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday. European counterparts were made aware Monday prior to the speech, officials said.

Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to exit the Iran nuke deal, which was signed during the Obama administration. And though he has yet to end it, a crucial deadline for re-certifying the deal is on the horizon.

""In a few days’ time, President Trump… will make a decision on what to do with the nuclear deal,"" he said. ""I’m sure he’ll do the right thing, the right thing for the United States, the right thing for Israel, the right thing for the peace of the world.”

In a question and answer period at the White House Rose Garden with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday, Trump said he'll make a decision ""on or before"" May 12.

""That doesn't mean I won't negotiate a new agreement,"" the president said, adding that ""we'll see what happens.""

Netanyahu's statement also came on the heels of a missile attack in northern Syria that killed nearly 26-pro-government fighters, mostly Iranians, according to a Syria war monitoring group. Israel had no comment on the strike, but there was widespread speculation that Israel was responsible. Tehran has sent thousands of Iran-backed fighters to help President Bashar Assad's forces in Syria's seven-year civil war.

Israel and Iran are arch-enemies, and Israel has said repeatedly it would not allow Iran to establish a permanent military presence in Syria. Iran has already accused Israel of carrying out another airstrike in Syria this month that killed seven Iranian military advisers and vowed revenge.

SUSPECTED ISRAELI 'EARTHQUAKE-LEVEL' SYRIA STRIKE KILLS MOSTLY IRANIANS

Pompeo on Sunday ratcheted up the Trump administration's rhetoric against Iran and offered warm support to Israel, and Saudi Arabia, in the standoff with Tehran.

""The United States is with Israel in this fight,"" Pompeo said.

The 2015 nuke deal gave Iran relief from crippling sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.

Netanyahu has been a leading critic of the agreement, saying it fails to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons capability and welcoming Trump's pledges to withdraw from the deal if it is not changed.

""The nuclear deal gives Iran a clear path to producing an atomic arsenal,"" he said Monday.

On Monday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the time when Iran's enemies can ""hit and run"" is over.

""They know if they enter military conflict with Iran, they will be hit multiple times,"" he said, according to his website. He did not specifically refer to the latest attack in Syria.

Michael Oren, a senior Israeli official, had no comment on the airstrike in Syria, but warned both Syria and Iran against trying to attack.

""If someone shoots at us, we shoot back and we will shoot back either at the Syrian army or the Iranians, at the origin of the aggression,"" Oren said.

The Knesset — the Israeli Parliament — voted after Netanyahu's speech on Monday in favor of a bill that would allow the prime minister to declare war with only the defense minister's approval, in extreme situations. A declaration of war could only previously be ordered by the security cabinet.

Netanyahu spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron Monday night.

The prime minister said he'd send representatives to Germany and France soon to show them the information that was presented Monday. He said he also plans to speak with leaders in China and the U.K.

The prime minister and Putin also spoke about the recent events in Syria and agreed to meet ""very soon.""

"A co-founder of the terror group Hamas died Tuesday, three weeks after accidentally shooting himself in the face while cleaning his weapon, an official said.

Imad al-Alami, 62, was “examining his personal weapon in his home” Jan. 9 when the gun went off and a bullet struck him in the face, Hamas said.

He had been hospitalized in Gaza until his death, according to the Jerusalem Post.

Hamas initially announced al-Alami died of natural causes, dispelling rumors he'd committed suicide or was murdered. However, the group later admitted an accident had actually caused al-Alami's death.

Al-Alami held several key posts as a member of Hamas’ policy-making body and lived in Syria until 2012. He remained a top-ranking official, though not a member of the militant outfit's current staff.

After the 2014 Israel-Hamas war, al-Alami traveled to Turkey for treatment for an injury in which he lost a leg. Hamas said he was wounded in the war.

"The British government’s decision to allow two critically ill babies to die in two years is a natural reflection of the culture of death and the steady increase in totalitarian tendencies among Western governments.

Last year, the British government ordered life support removed from Charlie Gard, ending his life when he was just 11 months old. Now, Alfie Evans – just 23 months old – has received what amounts to the same death sentence. On Monday, he was removed from life support by court order – against the wishes of his parents.

Then something remarkable happened. The child confounded his doctors and refused to die.

As of the time I am writing this, Alfie Evans is still alive and is breathing unaided. This is despite the claim made by a medical professional during a court hearing that Alfie would die quickly – possibly in “minutes” – if taken off life support.

At least twice in two years we have seen a supposedly free country’s court system impose what amounts to a death sentence on its most innocent citizens.

But even this display of the power of the human spirit to defy the expectations of the supposedly rational and objective state did nothing to sway the minds of the British courts and state-run medical apparatus.

On Wednesday, another legal appeal by Alfie’s parents to be allowed to try and save their son’s life was denied.

Continue Reading Below

The secular system has asserted its right to define what lives are worth living and is determined to prevent its authority from being questioned. Alfie Evans’ life – like Charlie Gard’s before him – has been determined to be limited by the standards of the secular state, and therefore without value.

These tragic government-imposed death sentences for innocent infants should frighten all of us about increasing secularism in society and the steady shift towards a totalitarian willingness to control our lives – down to and including ending them – on the government’s terms.

This is a direct assault on the core premise of the Declaration of Independence. We Americans asserted that we “are endowed by (our) Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.” In the American Revolution, in our fight against the British crown, we asserted that rights come from God – not from government.

However, our secular, liberal culture increasingly dismisses the concept of God and asserts that our rights come from a rational contract enforced by government.

In the original American model, we asserted our God-given rights against the power of a potentially tyrannical government. In the emerging left-wing secular order, since there is no God our rights depend on a secular state controlling itself.

Britain is giving us a vivid, tragic sense of how dangerous and heartless government tyranny can be once God is rejected and there is nothing between us and the government.

Ironically, this latest decision was made the same year Stephen Hawking died – 55 years after he was diagnosed with ALS (commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease) and told he had only two years to live.

Apparently, the British government learned no lessons from Hawking’s remarkable lifetime of work and achievement, which he pursued despite having to battle an extraordinarily challenging illness.

In fact, in 1985 Hawking contracted pneumonia while he was writing “A Brief History of Time,” and his wife was asked if his life should be terminated. She refused, and Hawking went on to live another 33 years and publish one of the most acclaimed books of the 20th century, which has since sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. This was all after it was suggested he be taken off life support.

Hawking should be a permanent reminder that the human spirit is more important than the human body, and that the will to live and achieve should not be destroyed by the state.

Yet in the very country that produced and nurtured Hawking, the government still ordered the removal of life support from two babies. In both cases there has been an organized alternative to government-imposed death.

Charlie Gard’s condition was potentially treatable by an experimental process in the United States. An American hospital and other organizations were willing to treat him. Supporters gave more than 1.3 million pounds (about $1.8 million) to pay for the travel and treatment.

Charlie’s parents wanted him to have the chance to live. However, the British bureaucracy took time to consider if he could go to the U.S. for treatment. During that bureaucratic process, his condition worsened. Then it was too late.

While the bureaucratic deliberation continued, Charlie’s parents and those who wanted to try to save him were told they had no right to help their own child. The child belonged to the government, and the government would decide whether he had the right to live.

This year, Alfie Evans had international support for an opportunity to live. The “pope’s hospital” – Bambino Gesù Pediatric Hospital in Rome – has offered to treat Alfie (as it did with Charlie). Pope Francis has publicly appealed to the British government to allow the young boy to be taken to Rome.

An air ambulance was sent to Alfie’s hospital earlier this week to bring him to the doctors who wanted to try for a miraculous cure.

What better place is there to hope for a miracle than in the pope’s pediatric hospital, which has helped many children with rare diseases?

This appeal for hope fell on the deaf ears of the state, which refused to allow Alfie’s parents to transfer their child to Rome. In fact, The Telegraph reported that despite a judge ruling that Alfie’s parents could “explore” taking the child home, doctors treating the child have been against this because they fear that “in the ‘worst case’ they would try to take the boy abroad.""

In other words, the “worst case” scenario would be for Alfie’s parents to seek medical help to save their child.

This is monstrous. It is difficult to understand the arrogance and coldness of British judges who prefer to order death rather than allow parents to fight for the lives of their children. Yet at least twice in two years we have seen a supposedly free country’s court system impose what amounts to a death sentence on its most innocent citizens.

Some of this cruelty and inhumanity is a function of the growing culture of death and the expanding sense that secular values must drive religious values out of public life.

Some of it comes from Britain’s National Health Service, which must bureaucratically define what is worth investing in and what is not. In a world of limited medical resources, little babies with rare conditions become expendable “for the greater good.” The fact that we are all diminished makes no difference to the atheist bureaucratic left.

Those who say they favor socialism must be made to confront this inhumanity, which is an integral part of socialist implementation. When the government controls everything, the government defines everything, and humanity is crushed beneath petty rules and petty rulers.

In America, we are watching the steady growth of intolerance and the totalitarian impulse. Look at the campuses that now seek to control speech. Look at the polls that show young people are being educated into support for censorship.

Look at the California Legislature, which is considering legislation that – taken to its logical conclusion – will outlaw the sale and distribution of the Bible and the Koran (the secular society sees both as intolerant, dangerous documents).

When you read about these two babies being denied life support by a supposedly free government, remember what John Donne warned when he wrote “any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.”

In these two years, we have seen two babies effectively sentenced to death by a government we would once have considered humane. What will the next horror be?",world

When almost all the protesters at recent anti-government rallies across Russia went home, teenagers and young adults were the only ones left on the streets.

""In my circle, more and more people are getting protest-minded,"" said 20-year-old theater student Andrei Zabara, one of about two dozen youths who ended up staying camped on the streets of Moscow on Sunday. ""My parents are supporting the protest. The girl who was streaming it on Instagram last night — her mom was helping, she brought us food. But as far as the rallies go, (the parents) are afraid to come out.""

Many born during President Vladimir Putin's 18-year-long rule, young Russians like Zabara have long been considered one of his most loyal constituents. But increasingly, the government's anti-Western agenda and reports of widespread corruption are turning young Russians against the leader.

In the decade following the collapse of the Soviet Union, street protests were led by 50- and 60-year-olds, disenchanted by the free-wheeling capitalism while their children were busy reinventing themselves in a new market economy. In 2011, when Putin announced his return to the presidency, it was the budding middle-aged middle class that took to the streets to protest what they saw as an unfair and archaic political system. But the violent crackdown on a rally in May 2012 and ensuing criminal persecutions of a dozen protesters have scared off the 40-year-olds.

In the meantime, their teenage children have taken the lead. With Russia's rigid political system offering no other outlet for discontent, young people have turned to unsanctioned street protests, ignoring official bans and unafraid of police brutality.

""Young people are taking to the streets on behalf of their parents, not against them,"" said Moscow-based political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann. ""Those kids enjoy the support of their parents who may be wary of the risks, may be afraid (of coming out)... but they share the same values.""

Zabara says his parents are supportive of his activism but are too afraid to join him on the streets, fearing repercussions for their jobs. Some teenagers attended the protest with their parents.

Yevgeny Roizman, who served as mayor of Russia's fourth-largest city Yekaterinburg and is considered one of the most popular opposition leaders in the regions, said he found Sunday's protest crowd in Yekaterinburg substantially younger than he expected.

""Young people are coming out for us and taking the hit,"" he said in a video blog earlier this week, adding that older people should ""feel ashamed.""

More than 1,000 people were arrested at protest rallies across Russia last Sunday.

The most recent wave of anti-government protests erupted in spring 2017 when opposition leader Alexei Navalny released a YouTube expose of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's alleged wealth. The video got more than 27 million views, and Navalny's foray into social media and YouTube blogging brought to the streets a younger, more determined and angrier generation.

Emboldened by support from the youth, Navalny has been gathering supporters in central locations in Moscow and other cities, often resulting in run-ins with the police.

Viktor, a 16-year old high school student who asked his last name not to be published for fear of trouble in school, said he started going to rallies last year. He believed the protest crowd is ready to go one step further.

""I can feel this transformation of the youth, of the minds. Before that the rallies were like you shout all you want and then everyone leaves,"" he said. ""Now people are staying, organizing round-the-clock rallies, marching on to the Kremlin.""

At the demonstration on Sunday, several dozen protesters charged at barriers across the road from the Kremlin and clashed with riot police. The rally fizzled out after some of them were beaten up by police and detained. In the end, some 20 protesters decided to camp out at the protest venue and spend the night there. In the morning, police officers showed up at what looked like an improvised picnic, and asked the young people to go to the police station with them.

Four days later, a dozen young protesters were still roaming the streets of Moscow.

Talking about the protest's turn to violence is fraught with consequences in Russia, as law enforcement agencies have been using new draconian laws to bring criminal charges against opposition-minded youth for something as minor as a blog post or a tweet.

Zabara says the protesters are willing to consider ""more radical methods"" and go further than their parents, adding that many young people have been inspired by demonstrations in neighboring Armenia, where the country's long-serving president and government resigned in the face of massive street protests. He quickly added, however, that he supports a peaceful resistance.

Young Russians who grew up under Putin have traditionally been one of his most ardent supporters, enjoying the benefits of a booming consumer economy and relative freedoms that their parents could only dream of under Communism.

But urban youth is becoming gradually disenchanted with Putin as the state has been aggressively promoting anti-Western attitudes, patriotism and traditional Christian values — including lectures about Orthodox Christianity at schools and universities and officials assailing specific Western films or music.

Lev Gudkov, director of the independent polling agency Levada Center, says the pollsters are beginning to see Putin's popularity among young people wane.

""Something began to change with young people last year,"" he said. ""Young people don't like the anti-Western rhetoric and an embrace of traditional values as far as youth culture, fashion, sexual behavior and morals are concerned.""

Gudhov said the youths who self-organize via messenger chats and get beaten up by riot police are getting a crash course in political activism — and will soon form a solid opposition when they're older.

""That protest-minded youth who get hit by batons... they will learn how to resist the pressure,"" he said. ""And we can expect a consolidated resistance against the authoritarian regime before too long.""",world

Steven Reece pulls a shield over his face, takes a weed whacker in hand, and begins trimming tall grass in an overgrown, tick-infested Jewish cemetery in western Ukraine where tombstones lie toppled and broken.

For years now, Reece, an ordained Southern Baptist minister from Texas, has been cleaning Jewish cemeteries and erecting memorial plaques at mass grave sites in Poland, and recently Ukraine. The region, once Europe's Jewish heartland, saw millions of Jews shot and gassed by Nazi German forces during World War II, sometimes with the help of local collaborators.

The 63-year-old American says cleaning up old cemeteries is his way, as a Christian, of honoring Holocaust victims while supporting the surviving Jewish communities here.

He also hopes his mission can help alleviate the bitterness and misunderstanding that still festers sometimes between Christians and Jews. Reece explains that he is troubled by the failure of European Christians who mostly stood by passively as the Nazis marginalized, then persecuted and killed their Jewish neighbors.

""To me it means simply bringing together people who are separated by distance, by space, by conflict,"" Reece said, taking a break during a recent clean-up operation in Rohatyn, Ukraine, which before the war was part of Poland.

""I saw the Jewish cemetery as a way to bring Jew and Christian together in a common place where they could work together with one another.""

Outside Ukraine, Reece and his team cleaned seven cemeteries in Poland this summer, including one in Oswiecim, the town where Nazi Germany ran the Auschwitz death camp.

Reece, who grew up in Texas and is now a resident of Peachtree Corners, Georgia, says he is driven by a desire for justice that has been with him since his boyhood in the American South, where the mistreatment and segregation of Black Americans was instituted in law.

""I was in the seventh grade when Martin Luther King was assassinated. That made a tremendous impact upon me,"" Reece said during an interview in Warsaw. ""And when I encountered the issue of Jewish Polish history, due to what happened here, I saw that there is a great injustice.""

Part of his mission involves encouraging diaspora Jews to work with local volunteers in Polish towns to continue the cemetery maintenance work. In 2010 he founded an Atlanta-based charity, The Matzevah Foundation, which takes its name from the Hebrew term for headstone. The foundation brings volunteers to Europe from the Brentwood Baptist Church in Tennessee to help him with his work and to engage with Jewish descendants.

Since 2012, his organization has carried out 28 projects in 14 different locations with the help of nearly 1,000 volunteers, including some 250 Americans, but also Israelis, local Poles and Ukrainians.

The recent work in Rohatyn was organized by Jewish Rohatyn Heritage, an organization run by an American couple, Marla Raucher Osborn and Jay Osborn, who have been gathering Nazi-damaged headstones scattered in the town and bringing them to the cemetery in Ukraine.

Reece first came to the region in the late 1980s when he was on assignment in Poland as a photo reporter. He later served for 12 years as a pastor in Otwock, near Warsaw, learning Polish and gaining a deeper understanding of what happened in Poland during WWII.

The country was invaded from the west by Adolf Hitler's forces and from the east by Soviet forces. More than 5 million were dead by war's end. Under the German occupation thousands of Christian Poles risked their lives to help Jews, but many did not act, and some joined the plunder and destruction.

Reece, no longer a minister, says he wants to help local Jewish authorities struggling to maintain 1,400 cemeteries across Poland — a legacy of a country once home to the largest Jewish community in the world. That population has dwindled from 3.3 million on the eve of Germany's invasion, to 20,000 today.

Mass grave sites continue to be discovered, and the challenge is made more difficult as Poland's economy grows and construction booms across the country.

Reece said some in the Jewish community at first wrongly suspected he was seeking converts.

""I don't deny who I am — I am a follower of Jesus — but that's the not the point of what I do,"" he said. ""The point of what I do is to reconcile.""

Poland's Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich said that initially, some were puzzled by Reece. ""Steven is so unique, we're not used to people like that,"" he said.

""But as soon as I met him I realized that he was the real thing,"" Schudrich added. ""There are special, unique, saintly people in the world. It transcends religion, nationality, and ethnicity. Steven Reece is one of them.""

Malaysia's prime minister-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim said Friday that it's time for him to return as a lawmaker, but reiterated his full support for the government led by his former foe-turned-ally Mahathir Mohamad.

Anwar and Mahathir put aside their 20-year-old political feud to help their alliance win a historic national vote in May that led to the first change of power since independence from Britain in 1957.

Anwar, who was convicted in 2015 for sodomy, couldn't take part in the elections but their four-party alliance had agreed that Mahathir would be prime minister and hand over the reins to Anwar. Anwar, 70, was freed and pardoned by the king shortly after the polls.

""The understanding ... is that immediately after the pardon, I should enter the race,"" Anwar told The Associated Press on Friday. ""I waited four months and I think it is also important for me to start connecting"" with lawmakers and focus on parliamentary reforms.

Mahathir ""will continue leading the nation, I will give full support,"" he added.

A lawmaker from Anwar's party earlier this week announced he had resigned as a member of Parliament in the southern coastal town of Port Dickson to make way for Anwar's comeback. The Election Commission will set a date for a by-election that must be held within two months.

Anwar said he will work hard to appeal to the electorate and explain how new government policies will benefit Malaysians.

Mahathir, who is the world's oldest leader at 93, told AP in an interview last month that he expects to be in office for at least two years and will keep his promise to hand over power to Anwar.

Anwar was once a high-flyer in the former ruling coalition but was convicted of homosexual sodomy and corruption after a power struggle in 1998 with Mahathir, who was prime minister for 22 years until 2003. He was freed in 2004 and convicted again in 2015 of sodomy, which he said was concocted to destroy his political career.

Anwar worked from his prison cell to forge a new opposition alliance by making peace with Mahathir, a gamble that paid off.",world

Typhoon Mangkhut retained its ferocious strength and slightly shifted toward more densely populated coastal provinces on Friday as it barreled closer to the northeastern Philippines, where a massive evacuation was underway.

More than 4 million people are at risk from the storm, which the Hawaii-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center categorizes as a super typhoon with powerful winds and gusts equivalent to a category 5 Atlantic hurricane.

It was initially expected to hit the northern tip of Cagayan province early Saturday, but it's now likely to make landfall farther south and closer to Isabela province then cut across the northern breadbasket, Philippine state forecaster Chris Perez told The Associated Press. The change won't make much difference because of the typhoon's massive size, he said.

A huge raincloud band 900 kilometers (560 miles) wide, combined with seasonal monsoon rains, means the typhoon will bring heavy to intense rains that could set off landslides and flash floods. Warnings have been raised in 25 provinces across the main northern island of Luzon, restricting sea and air travel.

The typhoon is approaching at the start of the rice and corn harvesting season in Cagayan, a major agricultural producer, and farmers were scrambling to save what they could of their crops, Cagayan Gov. Manuel Mamba said. The threat to agriculture comes as the Philippines tries to cope with rice shortages.

Mangkhut was tracked on Friday about 400 kilometers (250 miles) away in the Pacific with sustained winds of 205 kilometers (127 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 255 kph (158 mph), Philippine forecasters said.

After the Philippines, the Hong Kong Observatory predicts Mangkhut will plow into the Chinese mainland early Monday morning south of Hong Kong and north of the island province of Hainan. Though it will weaken from a super typhoon to a severe typhoon, it will still be packing sustained winds of 175 kph (109 mph).

The observatory warned of rough seas and frequent heavy squalls, urging residents of the densely populated financial hub to ""take suitable precautions and pay close attention to the latest information"" on the storm.

The gambling enclave of Macau, next door to Hong Kong, suffered catastrophic flooding during Typhoon Hato last August that left 10 dead and led to accusations of corruption and incompetence at its meteorological office.

On the Chinese mainland, the three southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan are coordinating preparations, including suspending transport and moving people to shelter inland, the national meteorological agency reported.

Guangdong, China's manufacturing hub, has set up 3,777 shelters, while more than 100,000 residents and tourists have been moved to safety or sent home. The province has recalled more than 36,000 fishing boats to port, while train services between the cities of Zhanjiang and Maoming have been suspended and all ferry services between the Guangdong and Hainan have been put on hold.

Fujian province to the north of Guangdong is also closing beaches and tourist sites and preparing other measures depending on conditions, the agency reported.

Philippine Office of Civil Defense chief Ricardo Jalad told an emergency meeting led by President Rodrigo Duterte that about 4.2 million people in Cagayan, Isabela and outlying provinces are vulnerable to the most destructive effects near the typhoon's 125-kilometer (77-mile) -wide eye. Nearly 48,000 houses in those high-risk areas are made of light materials.

Across the north, residents covered glass windows with wooden boards, strengthened houses with rope and braces and moved fishing boats to safety.

Duterte asked Cabinet officials from the north to help oversee disaster-response work if needed, and told reporters it was too early to consider seeking foreign aid.

""It would depend on the severity of the crisis,"" Duterte said. ""If it flattens everything, maybe we need to have some help.""

Officials said other northern provinces had started evacuating residents from high-risk areas, including in northern mountain provinces prone to landslides.

Mangkhut, a Thai word for the mangosteen fruit, is the 15th storm this year to batter the Philippines, which is hit by about 20 a year and is considered one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. Typhoon Haiyan left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and displaced over 5 million in the central Philippines in 2013.

In a Brazilian presidential election marked by uncertainties, there is little doubt about one thing: Evangelical voters will have a major impact.

They could tip the balance thanks to their growing numbers, presence in remote areas and poor neighborhoods and organizational muscle, especially since corporations have been banned from making contributions directly to candidates in the wake of a the country's huge corruption scandal.

Attempts to woo evangelicals are apparent on the campaign trail ahead of the Oct. 7 election. In recent weeks, one leading candidate wept while receiving prayers during a service at an evangelical church. Another promised no legislative changes to Brazil's abortion ban. A third held meetings with several of the most influential pastors in Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest and most populist state.

""The evangelical vote is very organic in that pastors and bishops have a relationship with followers that influences how they vote,"" said Antonio Lavareda, who has written several books on Brazilian politics. ""It's the opposite in the Catholic Church, where, despite having more congregants, priests have less direct influence.""

Evangelicals already have a large influence in national politics. The so-called ""evangelical bloc"" in Congress is made up of 87 representatives and three senators, about 15 percent of all federal lawmakers.

Their votes were instrumental in the 2016 impeachment and ouster of President Dilma Rousseff for illegally managing the federal budget. Joao Campos, a congressman and pastor who helped lead the bloc, said then that opposing Rousseff was a way to defend the poor who had lost jobs in the wake of scandals over kickbacks from construction companies to politicians.

Evangelical voters in Rio de Janeiro also helped propel Marcelo Crivella, a bishop in the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, to mayor of Brazil's most famous city in 2016.

Brazil, a deeply religious country slightly larger than the continental U.S., is home to the world's largest number of Catholics — some 123 million, according to the latest census in 2010. But evangelicals are growing and now number 42 million, or about 20 percent of the total population.

And there is little comparison when it comes to political activism. While the Vatican frowns on clergy running for office, many evangelical leaders plunge into politics.

The influence of evangelicals extends into media. Edir Macedo, the founder of Crivella's church, owns Record TV, one of the largest broadcasters in Brazil. Evangelical churches are also major buyers of airtime, so religious programs can be seen at just about any time of the day.

Silas Malafaia, one of the most influential pastors in Brazil, makes no apologies for trying to influence the votes of parishioners from his more than 50 churches.

During a recent interview with The Associated Press, he said proudly he had helped elect 25 representatives and five senators. His own brother is a state representative for Rio de Janeiro.

""I help candidates get elected by lending them my image and words,"" said Malafaia, who from the pulpit and on social media argues that left-leaning candidates promote ""moral garbage"" with liberal stances on gay marriage and abortion.

Malafaia has been outspoken in his support for Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right congressman and former army captain who has promised to crack down on crime and root out corruption in politics.

""In Brazil, we need a macho like him,"" Malafaia said, adding that Bolsonaro will ""defend all the values and principals of the Christian family.""

Last weekend, Malafaia visited Bolsonaro in the hospital, where the candidate was recovering after being stabbed during a campaign event Sept. 6.

""God is an expert in turning chaos into a blessing,"" Malafaia said in a video that he posted on YouTube from Bolsonaro's hospital room.

Albanita Alves, a housewife who attends Malafaia's Assembly of God Victory in Christ Church in Rio de Janeiro, says she will follow her pastor.

""We have the liberty to choose our candidate,"" Alves said. ""But as a man of God, (Malafaia) has a wider vision than we do, so it's important that we see his point of view.""

Last month, Bolsonaro, who is Catholic, teared up while receiving a blessing at a Baptist church in Rio de Janeiro. Geraldo Alckmin, a former Sao Paulo governor who also is Catholic, was a special guest during a meeting of pastors in the state last month. Marina Silva, a former environmental minister who belongs to an evangelical church, recently promised evangelicals in Belo Horizonte, Brazil's third largest city, that any changes to abortion law would have to be done via plebiscite and not by Congress.

The evangelical vote could be more important than in the past because the electoral field is so splintered, with more than a dozen candidates scrambling for advantages.

Now that former President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva has been bumped off the ballot for a corruption conviction, Bolsonaro is leading in the polls — apparently with the aid of evangelical backers.

While he gets roughly 26 percent in polls of all voters, he is backed by 33 percent of voters who identify as evangelical, according to a poll by research institute Ibope released Tuesday.

Ten percent of evangelicals backed Alckmin and Marina Silva and 7 favored Ciro Gomes. Trailing behind so far was Fernando Haddad, who has taken over da Silva's spot for the left-leaning Workers' Party, though the poll was conducted before he received da Silva's formal endorsement for the presidential run.

The poll interviewed 2,002 people Sept. 8-10 and had a margin of error of two percentage points.

""Today the candidates most in line with our values are Alckmin and Bolsonaro, but we still need to talk to them to know what each is proposing,"" said Bishop Robson Rodovalho, a founder of Sara Nossa Terra, a network of evangelical churches across Brazil.",world
"Authorities in the coastal city of New Bern, N.C., were working with federal responders to rescue at least 150 residents who reported themselves stranded in Hurricane Florence's storm surge.

Colleen Roberts, public information officer for the city of about 30,000 residents, told Fox News that 200 people had been rescued so far as the Category 1 storm battered the area with strong winds and a life-threatening surge.

FEMA teams were employing boats in the rescues and were determining which cases were the most severe. Roberts said many of the residents live near the Neuse and Trent rivers.

Flooding and a strong storm surge prompted more than 90 calls to the emergency operation center in Craven County, N.C., for residents trapped in vehicles and homes, spokeswoman Amber Parker said.

Response teams had already “brought in busloads” of rescued people from areas including Fairfield Harbor, New Bern, Adams Creek and Township 7, she said.

Four shelters were currently open, Roberts said, adding that dispatchers received a call for 17 people stranded all on one street.

"Sweden will go to the polls on Sunday in an election where the nationalist Sweden Democrats are expected to do well amid long-standing concerns over mass Islamic migration into the country -- the latest country to turn rightward as European Union countries struggle with the fallout from the 2015 migration crisis.



The vote on Sunday will be the first since the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015, which sent hundreds of thousands of migrants from the Middle East and Africa flooding into Europe. Sweden took in 163,000 in 2015, one of the highest on the continent.

But while the Swedes are known traditionally for their openness and tolerance of migrants, and the country has been seen as immune to the populist wave sweeping Europe -- the continuing migrant crisis has dented that consensus.



“Our questioning of mass migration and how to push back against crime -- everybody is talking about that now. That’s of course in our favor,” Sweden Democrats' leader Jimmie Akesson told The Wall Street Journal in an interview.



When in 2017, President Trump made reference to the problems with crime and terrorism Sweden was facing, he was widely mocked by many in the media. But concerns about migrant crime and terrorism are apparently shared by a significant number of Swedes.



According to The Journal, in 2017 police reported more than 320 shootings, dozens of bombings, and 7,226 rapes—a 10 percent increase from 2016. It notes that Norway only recorded one gun homicide in 2017, compared to Sweden’s 43.



Polls show the Swedish Democrats, who have made immigration restriction their main focus, comfortably in the lead ahead of the Sunday’s election with between a 20-23 percent of the vote where there are eight parties in the running.

HUNGARY'S PRO-TRUMP, POPULIST GOVERNMENT PUSHES SOROS CRACKDOWN



While well short of an outright majority, it could be enough to stop the ruling center-left Social Democrats, or the center-right Moderates from being able to form their own coalitions without the Sweden Democrats. It could result in a political deadlock in the country after Sunday.



What could also conceivably result is a situation like in Austria, where the center-right People’s Party formed a coalition with the further-right Freedom Party in December -- both parties had taken tough stances on the question of migration.



Should the Swedish Democrats find a way to enter government, it would be the latest -- although perhaps the most surprising country -- to be hit by the populist wave sweeping through Europe.



That wave was thought to have crashed in 2017, when French President Emmanuel Macron beat nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats came first in the German federal elections later in the year.



But Macron’s popularity has dived since coming into office, while Merkel took months to be able to form a working coalition, and has struggled to hold onto power since.



Meanwhile, in Italy a populist coalition of the Five Star Movement and the nationalist League swept into power after elections in March -- taking an unashamedly strict stance on migration from Africa and refusing to accept refugee rescue boats onto its shores. The combined popularity of the two parties in the polls is currently at approximately 60 percent.



In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s Fidesz Party, running on a strict anti-migration platform, strengthened its majority in recent elections -- and has been proudly touting its border security as a reason why it hasn’t had even one illegal immigrant enter the country since the migration crisis.

"Two powerful earthquakes rocked Japan within 20 minutes of each other early Thursday, just over a day after a typhoon in the country left at least six people dead.

The quakes — magnitude-6.6 and -5.3 — struck Tomakomai, the fifth largest city in the Hokkaido area, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). They each had a depth of roughly 21 and 23 miles, respectively.

The city lost power after the quakes hit, officials said. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's chief cabinet secretary said officials are working to assess the damage and help those in need.

NHK World, a public broadcaster in Japan, reported that the quakes caused ""huge landslides"" in the area. The country's meteorological agency said there are no threats of a tsunami.

On Tuesday, the strongest typhoon to make landfall in Japan since 1993 was recorded. It first made landfall on Japan's southwestern island of Shikoku and then again near Kobe on Honshu.

"At least one person was killed and more than 20 were injured in Massachusetts Thursday after a series of gas explosions tore through several communities outside Boston, officials said.

Leonel Rondon, 18, was inside his car when a chimney from a house explosion fell on his vehicle, the Essex County District Attorney’s office said. Rondon was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

At least 13 patients were taken to Lawrence General Hospital as a result of the gas fires. The hospital said one critical patient was taken to a trauma center, while the other injuries ranged from minor smoke inhalation to blast trauma.

Later, FOX station Boston 25 reported that more than 20 people had been injured.

Preliminary numbers estimate that between 60 and 100 homes in the Merrimack Valley caught fire in the towns of Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, Methuen Police Chief Joseph Soloman said.

Massachusetts State Police (MSP) confirmed on Twitter that at least 70 locations were affected by fires, explosions and ""investigations of gas odor.""

Residents in the aforementioned towns that are serviced by Columbia Gas of Massachusetts ""should evacuate their homes immediately if they have not already done so,"" police advised. Gas service was shut down by the company to roughly 8,000 customers.

""Numerous evacuations of neighborhoods where there are gas odors are underway,"" MSP tweeted. Columbia Gas was working to depressurize its gas lines, which ""will take some time,"" while National Grid cut electricity to the three towns ""to limit spark-started fires.""

Solomon — who noted there were no fires in Methuen but the town's first responders aided areas in need — said that in Lawrence alone, there were roughly 20 to 25 homes on fire. He said there were so many fires ""you can't even see the sky.""

In the town of Andover, firefighters responded to 38 fires total — all of which have been extinguished. ""At peak, 18 fires were burning at the same time,"" city police said.

Local officials said at least one firefighter and two civilians were injured in the ""gas-related fires.""

The North Andover Police Department advised residents with gas service in their homes or businesses to ""please exit the building until further notice.""

Some residents were evacuated from their homes to senior centers and middle schools as officials investigated the situation, police said.

Merrimack College, which is located in North Andover, advised that ""in an over abundance of caution,"" students and faculty needed to evacuate all buildings on campus, but later said all buildings were ""safe for re-entry.""

Gov. Charlie Baker's office said the governor was ""actively monitoring the situations in the Merrimack Valley and is communicating with first responders and public safety officials.""

The Columbia Gas company announced earlier Thursday that it would be upgrading gas lines in neighborhoods across the state, including the area where the explosions happened. It was not clear whether work was happening there Thursday, and a spokeswoman did not immediately comment.

Men wait outside the metal-grill door of a soup kitchen in a slum, hoping to get a small serving of beef and mashed potatoes. At a barter market on the capital's outskirts, a woman tries to persuade another to exchange for her granddaughters' tiny shoes.

Argentines are struggling in crisis in what was once one of the world's most prosperous nations. Consumer prices are soaring, unemployment is high and the Argentine peso has plunged, bringing back haunting memories of the country's economic meltdown in 2001 that pushed millions into poverty.

A growing number of people arrive at the ""Happy Kids"" soup kitchen in the Villa 1-11-14 shantytown, where servers try to stretch out steaming pots of stew because many more than expected are lining up for food.

""The city government gives us money for 440 rations a day, but we're being forced to prepare smaller portions so that we can cover 600 rations,"" said Cintia Garcia, who runs the soup kitchen.

A series of events battered the economy.

First, a severe drought damaged crop yields in the world's third-largest exporter of soybean and corn. The situation worsened beginning in the first quarter of 2018 as world oil prices increased and then interest rate rises in the United States led investors to pull dollars out of Argentina.

That caused jitters among Argentines, who have stashed away dollars as a cushion since the 2001 economic implosion, and a rush to buy scarcer dollars pushed the peso's value down. Despite several interest rate hikes by the Argentine Central Bank, the peso has lost more than half its value in less than a year.

President Mauricio Macri had to seek a $50 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Last week, he announced a series of austerity measures, including new taxes on exports and the elimination of several government ministries. He said he would allocate more economic aid and strengthen food plans for poor Argentines.

With unemployment around 9 percent and consumer prices surging, some Argentines are again turning to barter clubs, which first emerged during the collapse nearly two decades ago.

The tumbling peso has pushed up prices for fuel and, in turn, transportation costs. That has affected food prices in a country where most grains and other goods are transported in trucks. Inflation is expected to reach an annual rate of more than 40 percent this year, the Central Bank says.

""To make doughnuts a month ago, I used to spend 150 pesos (almost $4) for oil and seven bags of flour. Now it's more than 400 pesos,"" complained Gladys Jimenez.

Jimenez, who is from Paraguay, is one of those who rely on the ""Happy Kids"" soup kitchen in Villa 1-11-14, a slum crowded with tens of thousands of Argentines and immigrants from neighboring countries.

The price of beef has also increased in one of the world's top meat-consuming countries. Nicol Alcocer, a teenager who attends an educational workshop where the food is distributed in the slum, said that previously she would eat roast every Saturday. ""Now it's every four months,"" she said.

The rapid fall in the peso brings frequent boosts in the prices charged by vendors, leading to anger. Some slum dwellers recalled that when the peso recently fell to 40 to the dollar, they lined up at small local stores but the owners refused to sell to them.

""I told my husband: 'Let's go buy.' People were all riled up seeing that businesses were closed,"" said Martina Bilbao. ""I remember the looting of 2001 ... and I think it's going to happen again.""

The crisis 17 years ago was so bad that one of every five Argentines was out of work and more than half of the population fell into poverty. The peso, which had been tied to the dollar, lost about 75 percent of its value.

Banks froze deposits and barricaded behind sheet metal as thousands of protesters unsuccessfully tried to withdraw savings. More than 20 people died in protests and looting that swept Argentina in December 2001 as Latin America's third-largest economy unraveled and eventually defaulted on a debt of more than $100 billion.

The current economic woes are far from that collapse. But analysts say that poverty, which affects about a third of the population, will rise this year, and the economy will take a dive.

Those forecasts are far from the promises of Macri. The conservative president took office in 2015 vowing that he would revive Argentina's weak economy and end poverty.

Although his market-friendly reforms were initially praised by international investors, who said they laid the groundwork for growth, they also brought pain to the country's poor and stoked labor unrest.

Since taking office, he has laid off thousands of state workers and cut energy subsidies, sending utility bills and bus fares soaring. Macri also dropped the previous government's foreign exchange controls, ushering in the sharp devaluation of the peso.

Many of Argentina's poor live in slums known as ""misery villages,"" where they often lack access to transportation, running water or sewage. Argentina's northern regions have chronically high rates of child malnutrition, even though the country remains a top global grain supplier.

On a recent day, dozens of women gathered at a barter market in the outskirts of Buenos Aires to trade everything from pants and cosmetics to toys, bags of rice and cooking oil.

""We've gone back to the same as before. We've gone back to bartering,"" said Lucia de Leon, who had a table where she offered to trade canned food and used shoes.",world
"The U.S. military said Wednesday that two Russian nuclear-capable bombers escorted by two fighter jets flew near Alaska on Sept. 11 before being intercepted by a pair of Air Force F-22 stealth fighter jets, according to a statement by the North American Aerospace Defense Command.

The Russian formation never entered U.S. or Canadian airspace, according to the statement.

NORAD said the Russian bombers and fighter jets were intercepted ""west of mainland Alaska"" by the American fighter jets at 10 p.m. ET Tuesday, but did not give a more precise location.

It's the second time this month a pair of Russian bombers flew near Alaska. On Sept. 1, the bombers were intercepted by F-22 fighters after crossing into the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone south of the Aleutian Islands.

In May, two defense officials told Fox News that two similar bombers came within 55 miles of the state's west coast. The Russian planes did not enter sovereign U.S. airspace on either of the previous two occasions.

The Russian military recently launched its largest military drill since 1981. According to the country's defense ministry, the Vostok -- or ""East"" -- exercise involves some 300,000 troops and over 1,000 aircraft.

Earlier Wednesday, the Russian military released video on Twitter showing a pair of Cold War era Tu-95 ""Bear"" bombers and a pair of fighter jets taking off from an airbase in eastern Russia.",world
"Members of the International Whaling Commission defeated a Japanese proposal to reinstate commercial whaling at a meeting in Brazil on Friday.

The commission suspended commercial whaling in the 1980s, but Japan argued that stocks have recovered sufficiently for the ban to be lifted and that no good reason exists to maintain a measure that was meant to be temporary. It has repeatedly tried to lift the ban.

Other countries argued that many whale populations are still vulnerable and that whaling is increasingly seen as unacceptable.

Japan's proposal was defeated Friday by a vote of 41-27 in Florianopolis, Brazil.

""This is not a debate about human rights nor is it a debate about global food security,"" Nick Gales, Australia's commissioner to the IWC, said during a debate on Thursday. ""It is a business proposition against which many parties hold legitimate environmental and welfare concerns.""

After the vote, Japan suggested that it would reconsider its membership in the international body.

It has argued that the commission has become ""intolerant"" and remains deadlocked on many issues because of the divide between countries that prize conservation and those that push for the sustainable use of whales.

Japan had proposed changes to the way the body operates, including a provision which would allow measures to be adopted by a simple, rather than super, majority.

""If scientific evidence and diversity are not respected, if commercial whaling based on science is completely denied, and if there is no possibility for the different positions and views to coexist with mutual understanding and respect, then Japan will be pressed to undertake a fundamental reassessment of its position as a member of the IWC,"" Masaaki Taniai, Japan's state minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, said after the vote Friday.

Patrick Ramage, director of marine conservation at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, noted that Japan has frequently threatened to pull out of the body.

The measure's ""adoption would have been a big step backwards for the IWC, returning us to the bygone days of open commercial whaling instead of becoming a modern conservation body,"" Ramage said in a statement. ""The real way forward for whales is conservation and responsible whale watching, not cruel and unnecessary whale killing.""

The Japanese have hunted whales for centuries and see it as a cheaper alternative source of protein. They currently hunt under a commission provision that allows killing whales for research purposes.

The number of whales Japan kills each year is now capped at 333, about a third of the number it used to kill before the International Court of Justice ruled in 2014 that its program wasn't scientific in nature.

Some, however, say the research program remains a cover for commercial whaling because the whale meat is sold for food.",world
"Swiss authorities said Friday that the Netherlands arrested and expelled two suspected Russian spies who allegedly tried to hack a Swiss laboratory that conducts tests for the U.N.-backed chemical weapons watchdog.

Switzerland's foreign ministry summoned the Russian ambassador to protest the attempted attack.

The Federal Intelligence Service says it worked ""actively"" with British and Dutch partners on the case involving Switzerland's Spiez Laboratory. Russia's foreign minister said earlier this year that the lab analyzed samples linked to the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England.

The confirmation came after Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad and Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger reported that two Russians suspected of being agents of military intelligence service GRU were kicked out of the Netherlands earlier this year as a result of a Europe-wide investigation.

""The Swiss authorities are aware of the case of Russian spies discovered in The Hague and expelled from the same place,"" said FIS spokeswoman Isabelle Graber in an email. ""The Swiss Federal Intelligence Service participated actively in this operation together with its Dutch and British partners.""

""The FIS has thus contributed to the prevention of illegal actions against a critical Swiss infrastructure,"" she added, while declining to comment further.

The Swiss attorney general's office confirmed it had identified ""two individuals"" as part of a broader investigation opened last year.

Switzerland's foreign ministry said it summoned Russia's ambassador on Friday to ""protest against this attempted attack"" and demanded that Russia ""immediately"" end its spying activities on Swiss soil.

Andreas Bucher, a spokesman for the laboratory, declined to comment on the expulsions, but added: ""We have had indications that we have been in the crosshairs of hackers in the last few months."" He said the lab had taken precautions, and no data was lost.

The Russian state news agency Tass quoted Stanislav Smirnov, a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Switzerland, as calling the Dutch news report ""absurd.""

""We believe that this is a new anti-Russian bogus story made up by the Western media,"" he was quoted as saying, alluding to the events that took place six months ago. ""We have seen this article and it gives rise to a lot of questions ... It is absurd, just new groundless allegations.""",world
"The Trump administration’s stern warnings against plans by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and his allies – namely Iran and Russia to wipe out the opposition-held stronghold of Idlib have at least temporarily kept the expected attack from moving forward, Syrian opposition activists tell Fox News.

“The offensive is certainly on hold, and that is in large part a result of the renewed commitment from the United States to establish consequences should Russia and the regime continue with reckless bombing of Idlib,” said Kenan Rahmani, Advocacy Manager at The Syria Campaign.

President Trump this week joined the voices of his entire foreign policy team - Vice President Mike Pence, U.N Ambassador Nikki Haley, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, National Security Advisor John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and new Syria envoy James Jeffrey - in issuing grim warnings to the Syrian government and its allies regarding the fate of Idlib, a city near the Syrian-Turkish border, where the remaining forces of Syrian opposition are holding out.

Rahmani on Thursday noted that in the previous 24 hours, air strikes from Russian aircraft in rebel-held areas significantly decreased, and lowered in intensity, a sign that America's “renewed commitment” to standing up to powers in Moscow and Damascus – accompanied by the Turkish government's deployment of more military equipment to the region – has brought a temporary reprieve.

“Russia and the regime have a long history of testing red lines and seeing what they can get away with, but there is a sense this time that this isn’t just rhetoric from the U.S, this is an actual policy,” Rahmani continued. “And the policy is that the U.S will absolutely not allow mass killings and mass atrocities.”

A Pentagon official confirmed the U.S. has seen a recent decrease in Russian airstrikes - though the situation remains dire.

""Last week, despite warnings from the United States, United Nations, and U.S. allies - Russian Forces backing the Syrian regime extensively used airstrikes and barrel bombs, accompanied by regime rocket and artillery fire, in Idlib. In the last two days, however, we have seen some reduction in these attacks, and we welcome and encourage any lessening of violence, particularly in vulnerable civilian areas,"" said Commander Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesperson.

""We have engaged the Russian government and military at the most senior level to make clear that the U.S. and its partners would respond to any verified chemical weapon use in Idlib or elsewhere in Syria in a swift and appropriate manner,"" Robertson added. ""We encourage Russia to make this point clear to Damascus. Syria, Russia and Iran should know that the United States and the rest of the world are watching very closely, and will take appropriate action if there is a new slaughter in Idlib.""

Ayman Abdel Nour, founder of the pro-opposition humanitarian aid organization Syrian Christians for Peace, agreed the clear message from the Trump team was not only welcomed, but had a quick impact on regime and Russian behavior.

“The U.S is still the biggest player on the world stage, and when they raise the doors it matters,” he said. “Assad can’t do anything without Russia, and the second day after the Trump tweet warning them the Idlib operation was paralyzed. Russia used to caution that Idlib would be cleaned out by the end of September, now they are saying end of year which at least gives more time for a diplomatic deal.”

Jeffrey acknowledged last week the U.S had deliberately started using “new language,” moving from threats that not only would a suspected chemical weapons attack not be accepted, but that the U.S. would not put up with any attack in Idlib “period.”

“Any offensive to us is objectionable as a reckless escalation,” he said, stressing the creation of a refugee flow or attack on innocent civilians would be met with consequences.

Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian government diplomat and co-founder of the D.C-based Middle East think-tank People Demand Change INC (PDC), said the new administration tone has altered both Russian behavior on the ground, “softened” their diplomatic speak, and allowed more time for a diplomatic solution.

U.S defense insiders have said “massive bombing packages” are being drawn up by the Pentagon, should Assad defy warnings and go ahead with a chemical attack in Idlib. One defense specialist, speaking on the condition of anonymity, emphasized that large-scale regime strikes would likely be retaliatory rather than pre-emptive, though adding that Syrian chemical weapons depots have already been identified.

“The U.S. just isn’t going to tolerate it,” the source added.

Retired Col. James Williamson, founder of OPSEC – a non-partisan advocacy organization focused on protecting national intelligence assets – concurred that the tough talk, for now, appears to be forestalling a Syrian offensive, but that warnings will need to be backed up with a potent military response if need be.

“When diplomacy fails, you set a red line and then you act decisively when and if it is crossed. I have no doubt this president will do just that,” Williamson said.

The Syrian government, along with Russia and Iran, have consistently and vehemently denied ever having used chemical weapons in the protracted civil war, despite U.N assertions they have been deployed at least a dozen times.

Hisham al-Skeif, deputy head of the political bureau of the prominent opposition group, known as the Peace Brigades, emphasized that major powers coming together has had a sizeable impact.

“The position of the United States and Trump is very powerful, with Europe standing by their side and Turkey too standing a strong stance has helped postpone the offensive,” he noted. “Turkey and the U.S need to continue their cooperation, they can restrain Russia.”

Turkey, the main international backer of the rebels, has reportedly been working to reach a peace deal with Russian and Iranian officials. Turkey’s own envoy, Feriddun Sinirlioglu, this week appealed to the international community to “vocally and actively” support a ceasefire in Idlib.

MORE IRANIANS 'BUYING' PASSPORTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES TO EVADE US TRAVEL BAN, SANCTIONS

However, the fear of both a barrage of chemical weapons and all-out barrel bombing is still very palpable through the overcrowded streets of Idlib.

“Turkey has secured borders; it is very scary. There are more than three million people here with nowhere to go,” Walid Ased, a 31-year-old mathematics teacher in Idlib, told Fox News in a telephone interview. “Trump is time trading with the harsh statements about chemicals, but Assad kills us every day with explosives and barrel bombs and missiles and no one cares for that.”

Former Syrian Brig. Gen. Zaher al-Sakat – once the Assad regime’s chemical weapons chief in charge of such operations before defecting to Europe in 2013 – concurred it is only a matter of time.

“There will be another chemical attack, it is clear from Russian speeches they are claiming in advance that the rebels have chemical weapons, which means that Russia and the regime will use chemicals and then blame it on others,” he told Fox News. “Even if a group like al-Qaeda had chemical weapons, they don’t have the equipment to use it.”

U.N investigators announced on Wednesday they had chronicled at least three more uses of banned chlorine weapons by Syrian government forces that amounted to war crimes, and called on world leaders to take definitive steps to fend off a “massacre” in Idlib.

“Assad takes Trumps threats seriously that there will be a price to pay. Nevertheless, I don’t think the U.S. will be able to dramatically alter the course of the Idlib offensive and the humanitarian disaster that will ensue,” added Raphael D. Marcus, a research fellow at the Department of War Studies, King's College London.

“But the announcement that they plan to keep U.S. troops on the ground in Syria is an effort to minimize, at least slightly, Iran and Russian influence and attempt to shape the aftermath.”",world

"Israel and Iran reached the brink of full-scale war Thursday as the Islamic Republic's unprovoked rocket attack on soldiers in the Golan Heights gave way to an unprecedented Israeli counter-strike that targeted nearly all Iranian infrastructure inside Syria.

The Israeli Defense Force said it deployed fighter jets and used missiles to strike a range of targets, including military compounds, intelligence operations and munitions warehouses, a statement read. The strikes were Israel's largest air operation in Syria since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

“The IDF will not allow the Iranian threat to establish itself in Syria. The Syrian regime will be held accountable for everything happening in its territory,” the press release read. “The IDF is prepared for a wide variety of scenarios.”

The missile launcher responsible for the Iranian rocket strikes was also destroyed, according to the release.

The strikes came in response to Syria-based Iranian forces firing roughly 20 rockets at Israeli front-line military positions in the Golan Heights. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an IDF spokesman, called the attack ""the most severe attempt"" by Iran's Al Quds force to attack the country. It was the first time Iranian forces have attacked Israel from Syria, according to Reuters.

Conricus said four rockets were intercepted and the others fell short of their targets. No injuries or damage was reported.

The White House on Thursday condemned the Iranian assault, two days after President Trump announced he was pulling the U.S. out of the Iran nuke deal.

""The United States condemns the Iranian regime's provocative rocket attack from Syria against Israeli citizens, and we strongly support Israel's right to act in self-defense,"" Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. ""The Iranian regime's deployment into Syria of offensive rocket and missile systems aimed at Israel is an unacceptable and highly dangerous development for the entire Middle East.""

Israel's rockets shook Damascus with the sounds of explosions just before dawn. Syria's state media said Syrian air defenses intercepted ""hostile Israeli missiles"" early Thursday that were fired over southwestern Damascus. Hours later, state-run Al-Ikhbariya TV broadcast a live feed of Syrian air defenses firing into the sky above the capital, and loud explosions and air defense firing were heard through the night. The footage could not be independently verified.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Israeli strikes killed 23 fighters, including five Syrian soldiers. Syria’s military, however, said early Thursday the Israeli strikes killed three people, wounded two and destroyed a radar station and an ammunition warehouse and damaged a number of air defense units. Syrian Brig. Gen. Ali Mayhoub said Syrian air defense systems had intercepted “the large part” of the incoming Israeli strikes.

There was no immediate information about Iranian casualties, but Conricus said the main intent was to target hardware rather than personnel.

Tensions between Israel and Syria have been on the rise as Iran has sent thousands of troops to back Syrian President Bashar Assad from an insurgency in his country. Israel has warned it will not accept a permanent Iranian military presence in Syria.

Though Israel does not intend to further escalate the situation, Conricus said troops will remain on ""very high alert.""

""Should there be another Iranian attack, we will be prepared for it,"" he said.

"Fighting has broken out in South Sudan two days after the warring sides signed what the government called a ""final final"" peace agreement to end the civil war. Each side blames the other for the attacks.

Clashes erupted Friday morning in Central Equatoria state when government troops stormed bases in Lainya and Kajo Keji counties, opposition spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said.

""That means the regime is not serious about the peace,"" Gabriel told The Associated Press.

The government called the accusations ""propaganda."" The attacks were instigated by opposition forces that emerged from hiding along the Ugandan border and were trying to reclaim territory, spokesman Lul Roai Koang told the AP.

An investigation into the reports is underway, the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism, the body charged with monitoring the cease-fire, said on Twitter. It reminded all parties of their commitment to refrain from hostilities. The body reports to the East African regional bloc that negotiated the peace deal.

South Sudan's five-year civil war has killed untold tens of thousands of people and created more than 2 million refugees, Africa's largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Half of the remaining population of 12 million faces hunger and the economy of the oil-rich nation has collapsed.

President Salva Kiir and the head of the armed opposition, Riek Machar, signed the latest attempt at peace on Wednesday in neighboring Ethiopia. Under the power-sharing arrangement Machar will once again be Kiir's deputy — an arrangement that sparked the civil war in December 2013 when supporters of the two men clashed. Machar's return to the vice presidency in 2016 was short-lived when fighting broke out in the capital, Juba, and he fled the country.

Many international observers have expressed skepticism about this new agreement. ""We remain concerned about the parties' level of commitment,"" said a statement by the United States, Britain and Norway, the troika that worked to bring South Sudan to independence from Sudan in 2011.

Four people who say Tibetan Buddhist teachers abused them physically or psychologically presented the Dalai Lama with written accounts from 12 alleged victims and appealed to him Friday in the Netherlands to address the problem.

A group using the hashtag ""metooguru"" gathered some 1,300 signatures on an online petition calling for a meeting with the spiritual leader so he could receive its collection of testimonies. He met with four representatives for about 20 minutes on the first day of a four-day visit to the Netherlands.

The Dalai Lama is the leader of one school of Tibetan Buddhism. Organizers of Friday's meeting at a Rotterdam hotel hope the Nobel Peace Prize winner will use his moral authority to influence the faith more broadly.

""What we want from him is that he is very clear about the fact that religious leaders in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition are not above the law,"" said Oane Bijlsma, one of the four people who met the Dalai Lama. ""That even if they claim that their tradition endorses behavior that is supposedly beyond good and evil, it can never be the case.""

The alleged victims, from the Netherlands and Belgium, said the Dalai Lama pledged to take action, including bringing up at a meeting of Buddhist teachers in November their reports of sexual, physical and psychological abuse.

The Dalai Lama did not speak to reporters after the meeting. Members of his entourage did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The people he met with emerged from their audience expressing mixed reactions. One said she was a bit disappointed.

But Ricardo Mendes, who said he was physically abused as child being raised in a Buddhist sect in Belgium, said he was pleased the Dalai Lama appeared moved by the accounts they shared.

""He was like: OK, now I have maybe the material. I have real papers, real stories of real people that I can use to point fingers in the Buddhist landscape and say 'This guy, this guy, this guy are behaving this way, and you should not follow them, and this is not Tibetan Buddhism.'""

That gave Mendes hope for the future.

Bulgaria's national ombudswoman Maya Manolova, responsible for protecting citizens' rights, called the detention of the pair ""unlawful and without sufficient grounds.""

She called for ""full disclosure"" and for police to be disciplined, if there was misconduct. The failure of authorities to explain the reason for the detentions left Bulgarians with ""the impression that there was an attempt to prevent a journalistic investigation,"" Manolova said.

Bivol said it was investigating high-level corruption and had informed anti-Mafia police that documents and computers had been removed from the offices of people implicated.

It said when the journalists got to the field, ""they were jumped on by the police at the place where shredded docs, most likely evidence of fraud with European funds, were deposited.""

It said the chief officer of the Directorate for Combating Organized Crime, Yvailo Spiridonov, called Bivol's editor-in-chief, Atanas Tchobanov, Friday and apologized for the lack of information overnight.

Bulgaria's Interior Ministry said Friday officers had received a tipoff about ""the intention to cover up corruption offenses,"" by destroying public procurement documents and had acted on the tipoff, detaining the two journalists and a third person who were on the scene.

It said they were taken to the district police department for identification and to explain ""the purpose of their stay in the area"" before they were released.",world
"Egyptian authorities deported a Lebanese woman who was jailed for insulting Egyptians in a video she posted online, days after she was sentenced to a suspended one-year sentence, her lawyer and airport officials said.

Mona el-Mazbouh was deported Thursday. She was arrested in May after she posted a 10-minute video in which she used profanities to describe her vacation in Cairo, where she said she was sexually harassed. She calls Egyptians the ""dirtiest people"" and Egypt ""the country of pimps ... of beggars."" She later posted a video apologizing, saying ""I definitely didn't mean to offend all Egyptians.""

In July, the 24-year-old el-Mazabou was sentenced to 11 years in prison but the sentence was later reduced to eight years. A higher court earlier this month approved her appeal and handed her a suspended one-year sentence.

She was released and boarded a flight with her family to Lebanon late Thursday after paying a fine of 10,700 Egyptian pounds (around $598), her lawyer Emad Kamal said.

Airport officials confirmed her deportation. They said el-Mazbouh arrived at the airport with police directly after she was released. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.

El-Mazbouh posted on her Facebook account photos of her arrival at Beirut International Airport. ""It was a nice experience. ... I was there (in prison) for three months and a half ... that's it. I am good, thanks God,"" she said in a posted video.

In her first video, el-Mazbouh said she was sexually harassed by taxi drivers and young men in Cairo. She also said her money was stolen at some point during her vacation.

She was arrested after the video went viral and accused by authorities of ""deliberately broadcasting false rumors which aim to undermine society and attack religions.""

Sexual harassment, mostly ranging from catcalls to occasional pinching or grabbing, is rampant in Egypt. Polls have found that a majority of both men and women in the conservative Muslim country believe it is justified if women dress ""provocatively"" in public.

The problem of sexual harassment in Egypt gained worldwide attention during and after the 2011 uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak, when women were harassed, groped and, in some cases, beaten and sexually assaulted during mass protests.

A study released last year by the Thomson Reuters Foundation ranked Cairo as the most dangerous megacity in the world for women. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi questioned its findings, but acknowledged in TV comments last November that ""there is sexual harassment in Egypt. There is a big percentage, but not to say it is the worst.""

Another last year by U.N. Women and Promundo, a non-governmental organization, found that nearly 60 percent of Egyptian women say they have been sexually harassed, and nearly 65 percent of men acknowledge harassing women, though they mainly admitted to ogling.

The poll, which surveyed 1,380 men and 1,402 women in five governorates, found that 74 percent of men — and 84 percent of women — agreed that ""women who dress provocatively deserve to be harassed."" Forty-three percent of men said women ""like the attention"" when men harass them.

Only 20 percent of women said they did.",world
"Young girls take turns to read aloud under a tree in rural Mozambique, part of a project by Gorongosa National Park to educate them and keep them out of child marriage.

The club meetings operate in 50 schools on the edge of the park, whose managers believe helping communities is key to conservation. Many girls in the southern African nation are particularly vulnerable, marrying and giving birth in their teens.

""We try to make a safe place for them to be able to speak up,"" said Larissa Sousa, manager of the program for girls who also learn about health and family planning and take trips to see Gorongosa's wildlife. About 2,000 girls are participating.

It could take a generation to persuade communities to let girls stay longer in school rather than drop out, marry and give birth in line with old customs, Sousa said. The girls' clubs, which started two years ago, are gaining some acceptance after talks with local leaders and others, she said.

The emphasis on girls is part of a wider campaign to restore Gorongosa, led by a joint venture between a non-profit group founded by American philanthropist Greg Carr and the Mozambican government.

Much of Gorongosa's wildlife was wiped out during the nearly two-decade civil war that ended in 1992. The park is in an opposition area in central Mozambique, where political tensions led to sporadic clashes in the last few years.

Child marriage around the world has declined in past decades but progress has been slow, according to the U.N. children's agency. Mozambique has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world, UNICEF says.

Mozambican parents who give girls away in marriage benefit from a payment made by the bridegroom's family, and it also ""removes a mouth to feed — an important consideration for families living below or only slightly above the poverty line,"" UNICEF said.

One aim of the Gorongosa clubs is to help the girls understand that, once armed with an education, they can seek the same kinds of opportunities as the boys. Some boys have been allowed to join in the club's activities.

The legal age of marriage in the southern African country is 18, though it can be 16 if parents give consent. Girls and young women are vulnerable to HIV infection, and many women are illiterate.

""Children shouldn't be having children. It's dangerous,"" Carr said. ""When women are educated, all of society benefits.""

"The Latest on developments related to the war in Syria (all times local):

1:15 p.m.

The Kremlin says that President Vladimir Putin could meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan next week.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that preparations are under way for Putin's meeting with Erdogan in Sochi on Monday. He wouldn't elaborate on the meeting's agenda, but the two leaders are likely to discuss the tensions in Syria's northwestern province of Idlib.

The Syrian army, backed by Russia and Iran, is preparing for a military offensive to reclaim control over Idlib, the last remaining rebel stronghold on the border with Turkey. Turkey strongly warned against the military action, saying it would trigger a humanitarian catastrophe.

Russia has urged Turkey to persuade rebels in Idlib to sever ties with al-Qaida linked rebels in the area.

Turkey's military and defense chiefs have visited areas bordering Syria where the country has reinforced troops amid fears of a looming Syrian government offensive on Syria's last rebel-held province of Idlib.

Defense Minister Hulusi Akar and Chief of Military Staff Yasar Guler on Friday inspected troops in the border provinces of Hatay and Gaziantep.

Turkey has been reinforcing the border in recent weeks. Syrian activists meanwhile said new military reinforcements had arrived to beef up Turkish observation points inside Idlib.

The state-run Anadolu Agency reported late Thursday that commando units as well as howitzers, tanks, armored personnel carriers and heavy work machines were sent to the town of Reyhanli, in Hatay province as reinforcements

Turkey's foreign minister says his country is still working for a peaceful solution for Syria's rebel-held province of Idlib, adding that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would hold talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Monday.

Speaking during a visit to Pakistan on Friday, Mevlut Cavusoglu said: ""We will continue our efforts with Iran and with Russia. ... We will continue our efforts on international platforms as well."" His comments were broadcast live on Turkish television.

At a meeting in Tehran last week, the leaders of Russia and Iran backed military operations in Idlib despite pleas from Erdogan for a cease-fire.

"Mexican government officials say they're evaluating a proposal by the United States to pay for the deportation of foreign migrants in Mexico to their home countries.

The offer would help return mainly Central Americans to their homelands but no agreement has been reached, Mexico’s Interior Department said Thursday.

“The Mexican government has not accepted this proposal either verbally or in writing,” the department said.

Many Central Americans use Mexico as a jumping-off point to cross illegally into the U.S. In the first seven months of 2018, Mexico deported more than 57,000 Central Americans, mainly by bus.

The Interior Department did not say how much the U.S. has offered, only that it was “evaluating the proposal according to applicable laws, and in accordance with the priorities of Mexico's own immigration policies.""

But the New York Times reported this week that the Trump administration told Congress it planned to shift $20 million in foreign assistance funds toward helping Mexico pay for the deportations.

The money will move from the State Department to the Department of Homeland Security, and then to Mexico, the report said, with the deportations affecting about 17,000 people.

"U.S.-backed Syrian forces entered Saturday an eastern village held by the Islamic State group where intense clashes are ongoing a day after the extremists reportedly killed 20 fighters, the forces and a war monitor said.

The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said its fighters stormed Bagouz and are close to the center of the village. The forces added that they plan to open another front in the Sousseh area along the Euphrates river to increase pressure on the extremists.

SDF launched with the help of the U.S.-led coalition a wide offensive this week to capture the last pocket held by IS in Syria. The Kurdish-led forces have been among the most effective in the fight against IS in Syria, forcing them out of much of the country's east.

Despite losing most of the territory it held between Iraq and Syria since its peak in 2014, the jihadist IS remains a disruptive force in both countries. Its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, urged his followers to ""persevere"" in an audio tape attributed to him last month.

The IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the group's gunmen targeted advancing SDF fighters in the Bagouz area with mortar rounds, roadside bombs and sniper fire inflicting many casualties among them.

The SDF commander of the operation in Bagouz, who identified himself as Shergo, said in a video statement that the fighting is intense from both sides and that his fighters now control almost half of the village.

""We will take all this place from ISIS,"" Shergo said in English, using a different acronym to refer to IS.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said IS fighters are relying on a network of tunnels in the area and land mines to slow down SDF's offensive. It said that some 100 women and 30 men, including IS fighters, along with their children, surrendered to SDF fighters. The IS gunmen were taken to a tightly secured positions in the area, it added.

The storming of Bagouz came a day after the Observatory and a Kurdish official said IS gunmen killed 20 SDF fighters in the country's east.

The Observatory said the extremists took advantage of a sand storm to launch a counterattack, which killed 20 fighters and wounded others.

Kurdish official Ebrahim Ebrahim said the 20 fighters were killed in an ambush by IS fighters.

SDF said in a statement that only two of its fighters were killed and six others wounded in Friday's clashes.

The Observatory said Saturday that since SDF launched its offensive on the IS-held pocket, including the town of Hajin, 53 extremists have been killed as well as 38 U.S.-backed fighters.

The Observatory said SDF brought in Friday some 1,000 fighters to fortify its positions and boost the forces carrying out the offensive.",world
"The United Nations on Saturday condemned a ""direct attack"" on its peacekeeping mission in South Sudan after a government soldier shot and wounded a Nepalese peacekeeper.

The shooting came three days after South Sudan's rival sides signed a peace deal to end the five-year civil war that has killed tens of thousands of people.

The South Sudanese soldier fired into the air near a U.N. convoy in the town of Yei before shooting at one of the vehicles, the U.N. statement said, adding that the peacekeepers could not return fire because of the risk of hitting civilians.

The U.N. mission chief, David Shearer, called the attack ""unacceptable"" and urged South Sudan's government to bring its forces under control. Government troops earlier Saturday fired about 50 shots close to the U.N. base in Yei, the U.N. statement said.

South Sudan military spokesman Lul Ruai Koang told The Associated Press that the military was looking into the report.

The attack on the convoy came a day after fighting broke out in Central Equatoria state, the first reported clashes since the peace deal, with the opposition accusing government troops of storming bases in Lainya and Kajo Keji counties. South Sudan's military said the attacks were instigated by opposition forces trying to reclaim territory.

Many international observers have expressed skepticism about the new peace deal signed Wednesday by President Salva Kiir and the head of the armed opposition, Riek Machar. Under the power-sharing arrangement Machar will once again be Kiir's deputy — an arrangement that sparked the civil war in December 2013 when supporters of the two men clashed. An attempt to return Machar to the post in 2016 failed amid fresh fighting.

In his first major statement since the peace deal, Kiir on Saturday acknowledged that many South Sudanese remained skeptical but said ""I want to personally assure you that the agreement we have signed has ended the war. ... This government will not let you down.""

"Amid escalating political wrangling, Iraqi lawmakers elected an Iran-backed Sunni Arab as speaker of parliament on Saturday, the first step in forming a new government four months after national elections.

The 37-year old speaker was supported by the pro-Iran bloc inside parliament, the Building coalition, which is mainly made up of Iran-backed Shiite militiamen — underscoring the growing Iranian influence in the process of forming the country's new government.

During a secret ballot, 169 lawmakers voted for Mohammed al-Halbousi, the former governor of Anbar, and 89 others voted for the former defense minister, Khalid al-Obeidi, lawmaker Ahmed al-Asadi said. Two deputies, a Shiite and a Kurd, will be elected later Saturday, al-Asadi added.

""This is a victory for the Building coalition,"" prominent Sunni politician Mahmoud al-Mashhadani told The Associated Press after the session. ""No one can ignore the Iranian influence in Iraq, it's stronger than the U.S.'s (influence),"" al-Mashhadani added.

Early this month, the newly-elected parliament held its first session, but two Shiite-led blocs came into conflict, each claiming to be the largest bloc that should be tasked to form the new government. Namely, they are the Building coalition and the pro-U.S. Reform and Building coalition led by outgoing Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.

Alarmed by the political wrangling and the bloody protests in the southern city of Basra against poor public services and unemployment, the country's Shiite spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, called for the appointment of a new face to lead the government. On Friday, al-Abadi said he'll not ""cling to power.""

Two Shiite politicians from the Reform and Building coalition who attended meetings between political parties to form the government, said Iran played a major role in undermining al-Abadi's efforts to secure a second term. Iran tried to bribe and threaten lawmakers, they said.

Ahead of the parliament first session in Sept. 3, the U.S. brokered a deal to have Kurds join the Reform and Building coalition so that it becomes the larger bloc, the politicians said. Hours ahead of the session, a politician went to residence of the Kurdish diplomatic mission in the Green Zone to collect signatures from Kurdish lawmakers.

""I was surprised when I saw the Iranian ambassador sitting at the restaurant of the Kurdish residence to discourage the Kurdish (lawmakers),"" from joining the coalition, one of the politician said. ""He left fifteen minutes before the session started.""

Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to brief media.

Tehran had previously dispatched its top regional military commander, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, to Iraq to ensure the pro-U.S. coalition does not threaten its interests in the region.

Baghdad-based political analyst Essam al-Faily said that contributing to Iran's successful sway in Iraq is that it ""controls militias that have with influence on the ground. It has influenced even Sunni leaders.""

Under an unofficial agreement dating back to 2003, the position of prime minister is reserved for Shiites, the president a Kurd and the parliament speaker a Sunni.

Parliament now has 15 days to elect the president who will task the nominee of the largest bloc to form the government. Political wrangling among the Shiite-led blocs and other factions will likely indefinitely delay the process of naming a prime minister.

"Acting on a judge's order, Egyptian police detained the sons of former president Hosni Mubarak on Saturday along with three others in connection with insider trading charges for which the five are on trial, security officials said.

They said the arrests were ordered by judge Ahmed Aboul-Fetouh before he adjourned the case's hearings until Oct. 20. The Mubarak sons — wealthy businessman Alaa and Mubarak's one-time heir apparent Gamal — were taken to a prison south of Cairo after the hearing, according to the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.

The detention of the two brothers came as something of a surprise given that the trial has been proceeding without incident. It was not immediately clear if their detention has anything to do with a recent warning to Gamal Mubarak by a newspaper editor close to the government to abandon any political ambitions.

The two sons and their father were sentenced to three years in prison following their conviction of embezzling funds set aside for the restoration and maintenance of presidential palaces, using the money to upgrade their private residences. The sons were released in 2015 for time served, while Mubarak walked free last year. The trio paid back to the state the money they embezzled.

The three were first detained in April 2011, two months after a popular uprising forced Mubarak to step down after nearly 30 years in power. After a long trial, Mubarak was acquitted of killing protesters during the 18-day uprising against his autocratic rule.

The ongoing insider trading trial centers on the buying by the two brothers of a large number of shares in a local Egyptian bank that they allegedly knew was to become the target of a takeover by an Arab Gulf investor, a move that was virtually certain to dramatically drive up share prices.

One of the five ordered detained on Saturday is investment banker Hassan Heikal, son of Mohamed Heikal, a confidant of Egypt's late nationalist leader Gamal Abdel-Nasser and the author of a series of books giving insider accounts of Egypt's wars and peacemaking with Israel. He died in 2016.

Preventing Gamal from succeeding his father was among the chief motives for the 2011 uprising and the military's subsequent support for the revolt. The years that followed saw most pillars of Mubarak's regime go on trial on corruption or power abuse charges, but almost all of them have since been acquitted or walked free after repaying part or all the funds they had illegally amassed.

But while most Mubarak regime luminaries have since lived quietly on the sidelines, second-string Mubarak loyalists have found their way back to public life under the rule of general-turned-president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, particularly in parliament, a mostly rubber-stamp chamber packed with government supporters, and the media.

However, Gamal Mubarak's frequent public appearances and the relatively warm reception he has received from members of the public have drawn the ire of el-Sissi's supporters.

Yasser Rizq, possibly the closest newspaper editor to el-Sissi, sternly warned Gamal Mubarak in a May article against harboring political ambitions. He suggested that Mubarak's son may have forged an alliance with the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood to run for president when el-Sissi's second, four-year term ends in 2022.

El-Sissi led the military's 2013 ouster of Egypt's first freely elected president — Mohammed Morsi of the Brotherhood — and has since overseen a massive crackdown on his supporters, jailing thousands of them along with secular activists behind the 2011 uprising.

Egypt's constitution prohibits el-Sissi from running for a third term in office, but his supporters have occasionally raised the specter of amending the constitution to allow him to do so or to extend the duration of his term. He won a second term in office this year in an election in which his only opponent was a little-known politician known to be among his staunchest supporters.",world

As alleged Russian plots, conspiracies and crimes unfold against the West, prosecutors and pundits routinely blame Vladimir Putin or a circle of Kremlin insiders said to be acting on direct orders from the president.

Putin may indeed have involvement in some shadowy schemes, but is he micromanaging every suspected poisoning, computer hack and influence campaign?

Experts say not necessarily. Instead, they say Putin and his entourage may be sending out signals about what he wants, and ambitious officials and individuals scramble to interpret and fulfill them to win his favor.

The motley mix of Russians accused of meddling in U.S. politics seems to illustrate this. Gun activist Maria Butina, who is jailed in Washington on charges that she tried to infiltrate U.S. political organizations as a covert Russian agent, is among those on the margins of power who seemed to seize an opportunity to advance their own interests and potentially please their rulers by manipulating gullible Americans.

It's unclear whether Putin was even aware of Butina's activities. But the initiative — like Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya's efforts to meet with Donald Trump's campaign team, or online trolling credited to ""Putin's chef"" Yevgeny Prigozhin — dovetailed with the Kremlin's dual goals of destabilizing Western democracy and ending sanctions against Russia.

Only Putin can say for sure what strings he pulls. But some projects — such as the attack in Britain with a military-grade nerve agent in March — appear more likely to have his blessing. British authorities say the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal was carried out by Russia's GRU military intelligence agency, with a likely green light from the highest levels. Russia vehemently denies any involvement.

""Russia is not as centralized as people sometimes think,"" said Alexander Baunov of the Carnegie Moscow Center. Incidents of election meddling abroad weren't part of ""a single planned event, but separate people and actions"" operating loosely under the same anti-Western banner.

Such efforts don't always coalesce. Observers describe rivalries among Kremlin insiders as they jostle for favors or influence. Prigozhin's supposed financing of mercenaries in Syria, for example, is reportedly at odds with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu but helps Russia maintain a foothold in the Middle East.

""Putin's state is like a court,"" said Mark Galeotti, a Russia security expert at the Institute of International Relations in Prague. ""You have the people above making it clear what it is they are looking for, and then you have people below either looking to find ways they can leverage their existing opportunities and contact base to potentially provide value, or look to package what they've already got and sell it to advance their agenda.""

THE GUN ACTIVIST

Butina, ordered Monday to remain in a U.S. jail while she awaits trial, seems to be a fringe figure, whose gun activism started in Siberia, far from Russia's decision-making core in Moscow.

As Trump pursued the presidency, she and influential patron Alexander Torshin allegedly used their connections with the National Rifle Association to cultivate a back channel to Republican politics. They tapped a vulnerability on the American right: the growing number of conservatives who don't conform to the Washington establishment's consensus on Russia, said Michael Kofman, head of the Russian program at the CNA think tank in Virginia. Some on the right have shown great affinity for what they see as the unyielding patriotism, faith and imagery of Putin's Russia.

The pair were oddly open about it, using their own identities on social media and advertising their networking successes.

""One of the more remarkable aspects of this case is how not-covert, obvious and self-aggrandizing it really was,"" Kofman said.

Torshin leveraged his connections as a lawmaker in the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council. The body is ""a kind of trading post for different interests. Torshin has been a senior figure mediating between various different interests that come together there for over 10 years. He is a senior behind-the-scenes player,"" said Tom Adshead of Macro Advisory, a Moscow business consultancy.

However, Torshin's powers were limited. Gun rights legislation that he championed failed miserably in Russia. And while the FBI says the pair developed ties to Russian intelligence, there's no sign Butina and Putin ever met.

THE LAWYER AT TRUMP TOWER

Another Russian alleged to have tried to influence the U.S. election campaign was lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Trump campaign aides in Trump Tower in June 2016, reportedly to offer Moscow's help in defeating Hillary Clinton.

While Veselnitskaya has denied acting on behalf of Russian officialdom, scores of emails and documents shared with The Associated Press show she served as a ghostwriter for top Russian government lawyers and received assistance from senior Interior Ministry personnel in a case involving a key client.

Still, she's not exactly part of Putin's inner circle. Instead, Baunov said, ""she's a lady who was trying to advance her own personal career.""

The leaked documents suggest Veselnitskaya went to Trump Tower as part of efforts to help her clients try to overturn U.S. sanctions — one of the Kremlin's strategic goals.

""Some people in the Kremlin, in special services, could be aware of the existence of Veselnitskaya and what she was doing,"" Baunov said. ""But that doesn't mean ... everybody asked in conference calls 'how is her project going?'""

THE CHEF AND HIS TROLLS

Proximity to Putin is a key in such initiatives, and one of the most successful was purportedly launched by a player in his court: Yevgeny Prigozhin.

Dubbed ""Putin's chef"" for his well-connected restaurant and catering business, Prigozhin is considered the driving force in a media empire that includes the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg ""troll farm"" whose members were indicted by U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller in February for allegedly waging ""information warfare"" against the United States through social media platforms and internet-based media.

Observers say such projects generally go through layers of officialdom first — vetting by Putin's spokesman, chief of staff, foreign minister, spy service chiefs — who decide when and whether to inform the president himself.

The troll farm was ""a proxy body, not a government service,"" Baunov said. Its activities, including fake Facebook accounts and articles, ""were not taken seriously but they were approved, as an attempt to show the West that the web and the internet don't belong only to the West.""

The indictment hasn't deterred Prigozhin. The agency still exists; it just moved across town. And its parent company started an English-language site this year called USAReally aimed at American readers, six months before the U.S. midterm elections.

Prigozhin also is the suspected mastermind of a company called Wagner that sends private military contractors to fight in Syria, Ukraine and Africa. Three Russian journalists were killed in July in unclear circumstances while investigating Wagner's activities in Central African Republic.

Prigozhin is among a string of powerful Russian businessmen — sometimes referred to as oligarchs — who have been hit with sanctions or otherwise implicated in investigations into Russia's role in Trump's 2016 election. They deny wrongdoing, but observers suggest they are paying the price for the very proximity to Putin that allowed them to build their fortunes.

THE 'PATRIOTIC' VOLUNTEERS

Among the accusations of foreign interference that have hit closest to Putin are those involving the GRU military intelligence agency: the nerve agent attack in Britain and Mueller's accusations that 12 suspected GRU agents hacked Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic Party.

Military analysts say operations by the GRU follow a strict chain of command that travels up through the military chief of staff, the defense minister and Putin himself.

Putin, however, has suggested that the hackers could be independent operators.

In a possible acknowledgment of the potential value of such outsiders, Putin signed a decree last week making information about freelance agents who help Russia's foreign intelligence services a state secret, according to Russian news agencies.

In the past, only information about regular personnel earned such protection.

Putin's entourage got a glimpse into his thinking when he likened hackers to ""artists,"" saying last year: ""If they are patriotic, they contribute in a way they think is right, to fight against those who say bad things about Russia.""

Of the four people who protested on the field during the World Cup soccer final in Moscow, one is now in intensive care and another spent part of the week in a jail cell.

Two months since the tournament ended with France beating Croatia, the tolerant image presented by Russian law enforcement to the outside world appears to be over.

Pyotr Verzilov told The Associated Press last week how he and three other activists from the Russian protest group Pussy Riot used police uniforms to trick their way past security during the final.

""In Russia, definitely, the uniform of any law enforcement official carries a certain magical role,"" he said in an interview. ""Although all the stewards at the stadium clearly knew that no police officers had the right to be inside and there were procedures that had to be followed, that they needed accreditation, no one even had the slightest idea that an officer, a major of the police, needs to have his credentials checked. This just doesn't click in your mind.""

The four charged onto the field during the second half of the July 15 game to protest police brutality and authoritarianism in Russia. They evaded security and drew mixed reactions from the players — France's star forward Kylian Mbappe even high-fived one protester, while Croatia defender Dejan Lovren shoved Verzilov.

On Wednesday, five days after speaking to the AP, Verzilov was admitted to the intensive care ward of a Moscow hospital. He regained consciousness Friday, Pussy Riot member Maria Alekhina told the AP. She claimed Verzilov was poisoned — a loaded charge at a time when Britain has accused two Russian men of poisoning a former spy with a nerve agent.

Veronika Nikulshina, the protester who high-fived Mbappe, was detained by police Sunday ahead of a major protest in Moscow and held until Tuesday after being accused of disobeying police orders.

""It's definitely poisoning,"" Alekhina said of Verzilov's illness. ""I think there's nothing other than politics here."" Moscow police have not indicated they are investigating the case and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Russian law enforcement strived to present a tolerant image during the World Cup, and ignored rules which usually ban unauthorized public gatherings and drinking.

Police forces across the country even stopped publishing news about crimes on their websites, instead giving Russians a monthlong diet of lighter fare about visits to children's camps and Internet safety tips.

Two months on, and police have shown less tolerance for dissent and last week beat unauthorized protesters in the street.

During the tournament in June and July, Russians and foreigners alike found the police on their best behavior. Officers took selfies with fans, watched as supporters partied on the street, and turned a blind eye to those drinking alcohol in public.

""People have seen that Russia is a hospitable country that is welcoming to those who come here,"" President Vladimir Putin said during the tournament.

The government launched its widely unpopular pension reform on June 14, the day the World Cup began. Opposition was muted during the tournament, especially because protests were heavily restricted by a decree from President Vladimir Putin, but a new round of unauthorized protests across Russia on Sunday against the pension changes saw police and National Guard officers beat protesters with truncheons on streets near the Kremlin.

More than 1,000 people were detained nationwide, according to data from the law enforcement monitoring group OVD Info.

During the World Cup, ""things started to feel more liberal than they are, but if you look at any of the political processes that were happening, there were no signs of liberalization in any way,"" said Verzilov, who campaigns for reforms to the prison and law enforcement system. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny organized Sunday's protests, but couldn't attend because he's serving a month in jail after authorities last month charged him over another unauthorized rally in January.

Besides the shift in policing tactics, Russia is grappling with other issues raised by the World Cup.

The stadiums themselves are costly to maintain — estimates range from $2.8 million to $8 million a year for different arenas. Even though more Russians are flocking to club games, it's unlikely to be enough to cover the costs without government subsidies.

Any cash shortfall can cause embarrassment, with power supply to the brand-new Samara Arena briefly turned off last month when electricity bills had reportedly gone unpaid for several months.

While the World Cup was a PR success — and widely seen by fans generally as a good tournament soccer-wise — the need to cover ongoing costs for the sports arenas could be a sore point for Russians who end up working longer before retirement.

Around the world, football fans may have moved on from the World Cup to the new league seasons, but the tournament buzz remains for Peru supporter Giovanni Falcon, who's trying to build a new life in Russia.

Falcon arrived in Yekaterinburg, near the Ural mountains, in June to watch Peru lose 1-0 to France. After the initial sadness of watching his team being eliminated from its first World Cup since 1982, Falcon found he was falling in love with the host nation.

After going home to Peru to sort out documents, he's now trying to learn Russian and find work in Yekaterinburg, though the process of obtaining residency could be arduous.

""I started thinking 'Why not stay in Russia?' I found many reasons to stay here,"" he said. ""Here in Yekaterinburg they have many natural resources. Oil, mining, electricity, so it's compatible with my background.""

As for the protesters, Verzilov highlighted one unexpected consequence.

While a video of Verzilov being berated by a senior police officer at the World Cup final went viral in Russia, he became something of a celebrity in the precinct.

""A lot of the police officers liked the action,"" Verzilov told the AP. ""In fact, a lot of police officers at the station asked me for an autograph for their relatives.""

"One of Rwanda's most prominent opposition leaders walked free on Saturday after the government approved the early release of more than 2,100 prisoners with little explanation.

Supporters of Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza and the state-run The New Times newspaper posted photos of the opposition leader leaving Nyarugenge prison hours after the justice ministry's announcement.

Ingabire's release surprised many in the capital, Kigali, because it is unusual for longtime President Paul Kagame to pardon potential challengers.

Also approved for early release was musician Kizito Mihigo, convicted on charges of conspiring against the government, who along with Ingabire received a presidential commutation. The ministry statement said both had made their most recent requests for clemency in June.

Ingabire, head of the FDU-Inkingi opposition party, was arrested in 2010 and found guilty of conspiracy to undermine the government and denying Rwanda's 1994 genocide, charges that she denied. She was sentenced to 15 years.

Human Rights Watch called the charges politically motivated and linked to her criticism of the government ahead of the 2010 presidential election.

Rwanda's government has long been accused by rights groups of suppressing the opposition and having a justice system that lacks independence, which the government has denied. Human Rights Watch has expressed concern that the government uses accusations of ""genocide ideology"" as a way to silence critics.

""When prisoners are filing forms requesting a presidential pardon, prisoners charged with genocide denial and conspiracy against the government are not allowed to fill such forms,"" a prison official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the prison.

Some 800,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis, were killed by Hutu extremists during the Rwandan genocide, according to the United Nations.

Some in Rwanda objected to Ingabire's release. ""Anyone who peddles ... ethnic politics must be told in no uncertain terms that it won't be tolerated. Her release doesn't do that!"" Christopher Kayumba, a lecturer at the school of journalism at the National University of Rwanda, said in a Twitter post.

Still detained in Rwanda is Diane Rwigara, who tried to challenge Kagame in last year's election but was disqualified from running over allegations that she forged some of the signatures on her nomination papers. She denied it.

Rwigara later was charged with inciting insurrection against the state.

Critics have said Rwanda's government has been under pressure over Rwigara's arrest and that Ingabire's release is meant to reduce pressure both inside and outside the country.

In recently concluded parliamentary elections, two opposition parties won two seats each for the first time, a sign that the government is trying to carry out reforms.

The Latest on Typhoon Mangkhut (all times local):

6:50 p.m.

A Philippine official says three people have been killed after Typhoon Mangkhut pummeled the country's northern breadbasket with ferocious winds and rain that set off landslides, damaged an airport terminal and ripped off tin roofs.

Mayor Mauricio Domogan said three people died and six others were missing in his mountain city of Baguio on Saturday after ferocious winds and rain destroyed several houses and set off landslides, which also blocked roads to the popular vacation destination.

Authorities were verifying the drownings of three people, including two children who reportedly died as the typhoon approached.

Mangkhut's winds weakened to 170 kilometers (105 miles) per hour after the storm blew across Luzon island toward the South China Sea, aiming at southern China and Hong Kong, where residents braced for the worst.

Philippine officials are assessing damage and checking on possible casualties as Typhoon Mangkhut pummeled the northern breadbasket with ferocious wind and rain that set off landslides, damaged an airport terminal and ripped off tin roofs.

There are immediate deaths reported but Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana says officials in northeastern Cagayan province where the typhoon slammed ashore before dawn are verifying the drownings of two children. Authorities are also checking what happened to about 70 men who reportedly returned to their coastal village to check on their homes during the typhoon onslaught.

"The Dalai Lama said this week that “Europe belongs to the Europeans” and that refugees should eventually return to their native countries to rebuild them.

The Tibetan spiritual leader made the comment during a conference in Malmo, Sweden's third-largest city, known for its large immigrant population, Agence France-Presse reported.

""I think Europe belongs to the Europeans. ... “Receive them, help them, educate them … but ultimately they should develop their own country."" - The Dalai Lama

He noted that although Europe was “morally responsible” for helping those refugees fleeing danger in their home countries, the countries should let the immigrants know that “they ultimately should rebuild their own country” and go back.

“Receive them, help them, educate them … but ultimately they should develop their own country,” the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner added.

The Buddhist leader’s comments came just days after the populist party Sweden Democrats made significant strides in Sweden’s general election.

The party, which ran on a platform of opposing immigration, came in third, receiving nearly 18 percent of the vote, nearly 5 points up since the 2014 election. The small Nordic country reportedly took the most refugees per capita in 2015.

The Dalai Lama, who’s been living in exile since 1959 after escaping Tibet and settling in India following the Chinese communist takeover of the region, also echoed his remarks he made in 2016 concerning Germany and the influx of migrants from the Middle East.

""Europe, for example Germany, cannot become an Arab country. Germany is Germany. There are so many that in practice it becomes difficult."" - The Dalai Lama

“Europe, for example Germany, cannot become an Arab country,” he said, according to the Washington Post reported. “Germany is Germany. There are so many that in practice it becomes difficult.”

“From a moral point of view, too, I think that the refugees should only be admitted temporarily,” he continued, adding that “The goal should be that they return and help rebuild their countries.",world

An altar found at Guatemala's La Corona site suggests the Mayan dynasty of Kaanul, known as the Snake Kings, acted like its namesake in slowly squeezing the rival kingdom of Tikal, archaeologists said Friday.

A team led by Marcello Canuto of Tulane University uncovered the carved stone altar in the northern Peten region near the Mexico border.

When it was first found in 2017, the altar was encased in the roots of a tree in a collapsed temple. It took a year to painstaking pry the massive stone slab from the roots, fully excavate it and move it to Guatemala City, where it was presented this week at a museum.

The altar is dated A.D. 544 and depicts the Tikal ruler Chak Took Ich'aak conjuring two local gods from a shaft in the form of a snake.

The same man appears 20 years later as a vassal of the Kaanul dynasty and the ruler of the larger, nearby city of Peru-Waka. But the gods associated with him are different local deities associated with that place.

Canuto said the altar suggest Kaanul's eventual victory was the result of decades of astute politicking and cultural appropriation, not just battles.

Chak Took Ich'aak and his son ""are trying to show that they are praying or conjuring up gods that were there way earlier to give them that kind of legitimacy,"" Canuto said. ""It's almost like they're setting up franchises, but using the same recipes of local gods, claiming they had access to local deities. There's an attempt to render this whole process legitimate by appealing to local interests.""

A princess from the Kaanul dynasty — based in Dzibanche and later Calakmul, in neighboring Mexico — had been married into the La Corona ruling family two decades before.

It's unlikely that La Corona could have simply conquered El Peru, which was much more powerful, unless it had backing from someone even more powerful.

""This would be equivalent to Cuba defeating the United States in a war. They could only have done that ... if they had had the backing of the Soviet Union,"" Canuto said.

The enormous city-state of Tikal, whose towering temples still stand in the jungle, battled for centuries for dominance of the Maya world with the Kaanul dynasty. Just a few decades after the altar was carved, Kaanul apparently defeated Tikal by amassing a string of allied cities that encircled and eventually strangled Tikal. The symbol of the Kaanul dynasty were stone masks carved in the form of grinning snakes.

Francisco Estrada-Belli, a Boston University archaeologist who was not involved in the La Corona discovery, said: ""Its broader significance is that it shows the behind-the-scenes ... machinations of the Snake Kings as they are expanding their empire in the direction of Tikal.""

""Not long ago, we thought the victory over Tikal was the result of a sort of out-of-the-blue blitz,"" Estrada-Belli said. ""It is fascinating to learn more about how Maya empires expanded, just like in the 'Game of Thrones.'""

Tomas Barrientos, an archaeologist at the University of the Valley of Guatemala noted that ""for several centuries during the Classic period, the Kaanul kings dominated much of the Maya Lowlands,"" until the Maya civilization collapsed for reasons that still aren't clear.

""This altar contains information about their early strategies of expansion,"" Barrientos said.",world
"Thousands marching in the streets. Flaming barricades. Clashes between demonstrators and riot police in darkened streets. A semi-truck hollowed out by fire.

Costa Rica has been rocked this week by the kind of protests rarely seen in the country in comparison with its more tumultuous Central American neighbors. It comes during a labor strike that went into its fifth day Friday with no apparent end in sight.

Spurred by calls from public sector unions, demonstrators protested again outside the presidential residence and blockaded roads in different parts of the country to demand President Carlos Alvarado scrap a proposed fiscal reform before congress that includes new taxes.

Costa Rica's government is struggling with a deficit estimated at 7.1 percent of GDP this year, which has pushed up the public debt load and increased its need for revenue.

Alvarado is proposing to implement a value added tax to replace the existing sales tax and expand it to goods and services that are currently exempt. One of the most controversial measures is a 1 percent duty on basic foodstuffs.

Those and other changes that would limit unemployment assistance and the payment of some salary bonuses have met with vigorous opposition from public sector unions. Social security officials reported a daily staff absentee rate of 13 percent to 26 percent, causing dozens of surgeries to be postponed.

""Here are the people demanding no more taxes on the working class, no more burdens on workers,"" said Melida Cedeno, president of the APSE teacher union.

""This strike is indefinite,"" she added, ""and will end only when the government has the will to sit down at the table to talk with all the workers ... and withdraw the proposed law.""

Ahead of the strike's start Monday, Alvarado ordered police to reinforce ports and oil installations to keep protesters from disrupting commercial activity and fuel distribution.

In a televised address, he called the strike ""illegal,"" promised to guarantee public order and said the reforms are ""the only way to avoid an imminent crisis. ... Today their approval is not only necessary but also urgent.""

Protests intensified Wednesday with a mass rally of public employees who filled a main avenue in the capital, San Jose. The march ended outside the Legislative Assembly with some clashes between protesters and police.

There were reports of some injuries this week among protesters detained in clashes at a university, but none were said to be serious. In the Caribbean coastal province of Limon, a supermarket was sacked.

Authorities confirmed Friday that they were investigating the death of a 17-year-old in Limon as possibly related to the disturbances. The same day, roadblocks forced the suspension of the annual bearing of a torch to mark the eve of the country's independence day.

Universities and Roman Catholic authorities have offered to mediate.

The unrest followed a bitterly disputed presidential election in April that has left a polarized electorate in its wake.

Political analyst Gustavo Araya said the strike represents a resurgence of activity for the unions, which enjoyed a close relationship with former President Luis Guillermo Solis during his 2014-2018 administration.

Araya added that labor is more skeptical of Alvarado for being in a coalition government and for having as his Cabinet chief Rodolfo Piza, who is considered a right-wing ideologue by union leaders.

Despite the pressure, the measure has advanced apace in the Legislative Assembly.

""The bill has resisted a week of strike, the motions continue to be processed quickly and there have been no signs of any willingness to negotiate,"" Araya said. ""Under this panorama I would expect one more week"" of protests.",world
"Mexico's president-elect faced the toughest, angriest crowd yet since winning the July 1 election, going before relatives of crime victims and disappeared people Friday to try to convince them of his amnesty proposal.

Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has proposed investigations and truth commissions to find out the fate of missing people, but also says some offenders should be pardoned.

Some of the relatives who attended the forum in Mexico City reacted angrily, shouting ""Justice! Justice!"" and ""Don't forgive, don't forget!""

Lopez Obrador has often said that ""you cannot fight violence with violence."" Amnesty is needed to ""pacify"" Mexico, he says.

He staunchly defended his position Friday, telling relatives: ""I'm telling you: 'Don't forget, but do forgive' — that is my proposal.""

Lopez Obrador suggested he would lead by example.

""As soon as I am president I am going to ask forgiveness. I am going to ask forgiveness from all the victims of violence,"" he said. ""I am going to commit myself to doing as much as I humanly can to ensure there will be justice.""

Victims' advocates complain they cannot be expected to pardon people who have never been convicted for killing or kidnapping their relatives, and who have never revealed the location of their bodies.

There are over 30,000 people listed as missing during Mexico's drug war, and authorities continue to find mass graves with hundreds of bodies at clandestine burial sites. Few of those bodies are ever identified.

Families complain that Lopez Obrador has the cart before the horse: They say authorities should do a far better job identifying bodies and searching for victims, before considering an amnesty.

The victims' group Movement for Our Disappeared in Mexico said in a statement, ""Our primary need is for searches to be carried out, but truth and justice are also essential.""

""Truth and justice are not negotiable,"" the group wrote.

Lopez Obrador has promised to consult victims' groups on any decision he makes, and he held a similar but somewhat quieter ""pacification and reconciliation"" forum in the border city of Ciudad Juarez in August.",world

Many families with starving children in an isolated pocket of northern Yemen have no food except the boiled leaves of local wild vine, a sign of how some are falling through the cracks of international relief efforts trying to prevent widespread death from famine around the country.

The main health center in Aslam district was crowded with emaciated children during a recent visit by the Associated Press. Excruciatingly thin toddlers, eyes bulging, sat in a plastic washtub used in a make-shift scale as staff weighed each one. Their papery skin was stretched tight over pencil-like limbs and knobby knees.

At least 20 children are known to have died of starvation already this year in the province that includes the district. The real number is likely far higher, since few families report their children's deaths when they die at home, officials say.

""We are in the 21st century, but this is what the war did to us,"" said the health center's chief, Mekkiya Mahdi.

Yemen is more than three years into a civil war that has wrecked the country's already fragile ability to feed itself. The war pits Shiite rebels known as Houthis, who hold the north, against a Saudi-led coalition, armed and backed by the United States. The coalition has sought to bomb the rebels into submission with an air campaign in support of Yemeni government forces.

Around 2.9 million women and children are acutely malnourished; another 400,000 children are fighting for their lives only a step away from starvation.

At least 8.4 million of Yemen's 29 million people would starve if they didn't receive international aid, a number that grew by a quarter the past year, according to U.N. figures. It is likely to jump by another 3.5 million because the currency's tumbling value leaves more people unable to afford food, the U.N. said.

Humanitarian officials warn that in the face of unending war, hunger's spread is outstripping efforts to keep people alive.

When AP approached U.N. agencies with questions about the situation in Aslam, they expressed alarm and surprise. In response to the AP's questions, international and local aid groups launched an investigation into why food wasn't getting to the some families, a top relief official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of issues involved in operating in the war-ravaged country.

As an immediate response, the official said, relief agencies are sending over 10,000 food baskets to the district, and UNICEF Resident Representative Dr. Meritxell Relano said the organization is increasing its mobile teams in the district from three to four and providing transportation to health facilities.

In first six months of this year, Hajjah province, where Aslam is located, recorded 17,000 cases of severe acute malnutrition, higher than in any full year, said Walid al-Shamshan, head of the Health Ministry's nutrition section in the province.

""It's a steady deterioration and it's scary,"" al-Shamshan said. Even after treatment, children often deteriorate once again when they go home to villages with no food and contaminated water.

Aslam is one of Yemen's poorest districts, located in the Houthi heartland. Its population of 75,000 to 106,000 includes both local residents and growing numbers of people displaced by fighting elsewhere.

It saw one of Hajjah province's highest jumps in the number of reported children suffering from severe acute malnutrition: From 384 cases in January, an additional 1,319 came in over the next six months. That comes to around 15 percent of the district's children.

There appeared to be multiple reasons why aid was not reaching some of the starving, beyond the rapid increase in those in need.

The lion's share of assistance goes to displaced people, with 20 percent going to the local community, said Azma Ali, a worker with the World Food Program. Agencies' criteria give priority for help to the displaced and households without a breadwinner, though local residents also struggle to find food.

Under heavy pressure from Houthi authorities, international agencies like WFP and UNICEF and their Yemeni partners are required to use lists of needy provided by local officials.

Critics accuse those officials of favoritism. That especially works against the local population in Aslam, where many belong to the ""Muhammasheen,"" Arabic for the ""Marginalized,"" a community of darker-skinned Yemenis shunned by the rest of society and left to work as garbage collectors, menial laborers or beggars. The Marginalized have no weight with officials to ensure aid goes their way.

One humanitarian coordinator in Hajjah said local Houthi authorities distribute aid unfairly.

""The powerful hinder the work of the humanitarian agencies and deprive of aid those people who are in most need,"" he said. He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of problems with the authorities.

Some residents said local officials demand bribes to get on food lists — the equivalent of around 15 U.S. cents, but still too much for many.

Food deliveries come irregularly or are too small or are missing items, residents and aid workers said.

People in Aslam have become increasingly reliant on leaves from the local Arabian Wax Leaf vine, known in Yemeni Arabic as ""halas.""

In the village of al-Mashrada, a 7-month-old girl, Zahra, cried and reached with her bony arms for her mother to feed her. Undernourished herself, her mother is often unable to breastfeed her. She can't afford formula.

Zahra was recently treated at the health center but is dwindling away again. Her parents can't afford to hire a car or motorbike to take her back to the clinic. If they don't, Zahra will die, said Mahdi.

Zahra's mother said only ""the big heads"" — the better-off and well-connected — end up with international aid.

""We only have God. We are poor and we have nothing.""

"A firefighter battling the largest wildfire in California history was killed last month when thousands of gallons of flame-suppressing liquid were dropped from an aircraft flying barely above the treetops because spotters mistakenly sent it on a route too close to the ground, according to state investigation findings released Friday

The pilot and a supervisor flying ahead in a small guide plane led the giant modified Boeing 747 nearly into the trees on Aug. 13 because the pilots failed to recognize that there was a hill in the flight path, according to the Green Sheet report by the state's firefighting agency.

Because of the near ground-level release, the retardant struck with such force it uprooted an 87-foot (27-meter) tree that fell on Matthew Burchett, a 42-year-old battalion chief from Utah helping with the Mendocino Complex Fire north of San Francisco.

Another large tree was snapped by the force of nearly 20,000 gallons (75,700 liters) of liquid and three firefighters were injured, one seriously.

Global SuperTanker Services LLC, which operated the 747, said in a statement that it thought the area was clear of firefighters and ""acted within procedural and operational parameters.""

Two supervisors — one in the air and one on the ground — potentially face discipline or loss of their current positions because of multiple compounding mistakes, said Cliff Allen, president of the union representing California's wildland firefighters.

California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean said there are ongoing internal investigations into what went wrong.

""We definitely don't want this to ever happen again,"" McLean said.

The 747 was flying only 100 feet (30 meters) above the treetops, at least 100 feet too low, officials said. The goal is to fly high enough for the retardant to disperse and fall like rain, but at such a low level they said the slurry would have hit the trees at nearly the same speed as the aircraft — more than 160 mph (260 kph).

The guide pilot ""made a 'show me' run"" for the 747 pilot over the intended path for the retardant drop, and marked the path for the jet with a smoke trail, according to the report.

""Obscured by heavy vegetation and unknown to the (747) pilot, a rise in elevation occurred along the flight path."" The ground sloped up about 170 feet (50 meters) in the middle of what otherwise was a flat area, according to the report.

The guide planes have two people aboard, a pilot and an ""air tactical supervisor,"" a specially trained firefighter who directs the pilots of both the guide plane and the airtanker trailing behind.

""He laid down the line and he was directing the tanker and the tanker was following direction,"" said Allen, the union president.

McLean said spotters have a difficult job because ""the ground is very deceptive and very hard to read.""

The retardant drops were intended to help secure a firebreak cut through the trees by a bulldozer to stop advancing flames. Burchett and the other three firefighters were working on the hill next to the firebreak when the drop was announced over a radio and firefighters were told to ""Clear the area out.""

The four did not respond to the warning, though the report says that ""when personnel are working under a tree canopy, supervisors must ensure the drop path is cleared.""

Allen said the supervisor could face discipline for not getting an acknowledgement that the firefighters were evacuating.

It is not uncommon to have firefighters under retardant drops, McLean said, though he could not say if the four firefighters knew they were in the flight path or why they didn't acknowledge or act on the radioed warning.

A firefighter who can't move out of the way is trained to lie spread-eagled, face down, toward the oncoming aircraft, one hand holding the top of the helmet as it takes the brunt of the impact from the falling slurry and air turbulence that can threaten to lift a firefighter off the ground.

Burchett, a suburban Salt Lake City firefighter, was crushed by the uprooted tree, while the others were stuck by falling tree debris. Two had deep muscle contusions and ligament damage. One also suffered broken ribs, while the fourth firefighter had scratches and abrasions.",world
"Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm on Friday after making landfall earlier in the day in North Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane, weather officials said.

The agency's update came after Florence claimed its first victims Friday afternoon, when two people died after a tree fell on their home in Wilmington, North Carolina, police said. There have been at least four deaths in the midst of the storm, according to officials.

Florence was about 15 miles north-northeast of Myrtle Beach, S.C., and about 55 miles east-southeast of Florence, S.C., the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in an 8 p.m. update.

Moving westward at 3 mph, Florence has maximum sustained winds of 70 mph, according to the NHC.

""On the forecast track, the center of Florence will move farther inland across extreme eastern South Carolina tonight and Saturday,"" the NHC said. ""Florence will then move generally northward across the western Carolinas and the central Appalachian Mountains early next week.""

As the storm travels inland, ""significant weakening"" is expected through to early next week, the NHC said.

Among the fatalities so far is a person in Lenoir County who died while plugging in a generator, according to a news release from North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper's office.

""Our hearts go out to the families of those who died in this storm,"" Cooper said in the news release. ""Hurricane Florence is going to continue its violent grind across our state for days. Be extremely careful and stay alert.""

HURRICANE FLORENCE'S PATH: TRACK THE STORM HERE

The storm's first fatalities were a mother and infant, police said on Twitter. The father sustained injuries and was transported to New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington for medical care.

Earlier Friday, the Wilmington Police tweeted that they were responding.

Dangerous storm surge as a result of Florence continued to be a threat, while forecasters said ""catastrophic freshwater flooding"" was likely to occur over parts of the Carolinas.

A storm surge warning was in effect from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina through to Salvo, North Carolina, as well as the Pamlico Sound in North Carolina, the update said.

Areas from Edisto Beach, South Carolins to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as the Pamlico Sound, were under a tropical storm warning.

Gov. Roy Cooper said earlier Friday that Florence is ""wreaking havoc"" and he's concerned ""whole communities"" could be wiped away.

""Hurricane Florence is powerful, slow and relentless,"" he said. ""It's an uninvited brute who doesn't want to leave.""

President Trump, who in an earlier tweet praised FEMA, first responders and law enforcement for their response to Florence, is planning to visit storm-affected areas next week, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. The trip will take place once its confirmed that it won't get in the way of rescue or recovery efforts, she said.

SHIRTLESS MAN STARES DOWN HURRICANE WITH FLAG IN HAND: 'JUST BEING FREE AND AMERICAN'

Preparing for the worst, about 9,700 National Guard troops and civilians were deployed with high-water vehicles, helicopters and boats that could be used to pluck people from the floodwaters.

More than 600,000 people had already lost power by 1 p.m. Friday, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety reported.

Duke Energy said in a tweet that they expect 1 to 3 million outages across the Carolinas, adding that ""restoration in the hardest-hit communities could take weeks.""

Officials said some 1.7 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were warned to evacuate, but it's unclear how many did. The homes of about 10 million were under watches or warnings for the hurricane or tropical storm conditions.

"Brazil’s federal police are asking that corruption charges be brought against President Michel Temer, which could lead to his suspension from office.

Temer has survived two previous attempts to charge him.

A federal police report says it has evidence the unpopular leader received bribes from construction giant Odebrecht, which is at the heart of a regional corruption scandal.

Brazil’s top court said it received the report Wednesday.

The report will be sent to Attorney General Raquel Dodge, who will decide whether Temer should be charged for the third time since taking office in 2016.

If she chooses to proceed, two-thirds of the Chamber of Deputies would have to vote to suspend Temer and put him on trial. The body twice rejected previous charges against him.

Attorney Carlos Gomes is a political junkie who plunged into campaigning for national and local candidates as a teenager. Two years ago, he even moved to Sao Paulo to work for a law firm that represents several candidates for office.

However he says he won't be able to bring himself to vote in October's general election.

""This time, I can't choose,"" said Gomes, 30. ""These candidates are either uninspiring or plain bad.""

Record numbers of Brazilians are expected to do the same, according to polls and studies, raising the specter that whoever wins will struggle to govern Latin America's most populous nation. It also means that the political fights of the last years, which culminated in the 2016 impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff and the ascension of Vice President Michel Temer, who has since become Brazil's least popular leader in history, are far from over.

""Imagine a scenario with a president elected by one third of the electorate, beating another candidate who gets almost as much,"" said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper university in Sao Paulo. ""Congress will know that one third doesn't support him and another is against him.""

Such a turnout might be celebrated in the United States, where winners typically get about half the vote of the 50 to 60 percent of eligible voters who turn out, but in Brazil it could turn into political battles that threaten governability.

That's partly due to the fact many Brazilians remain bitter over the ouster of Rousseff, which they see more as a political overthrow than as punishment for any crime. And the country's fragmented political system — there are more than 30 parties represented in Congress — means presidents must spend much political capital forming coalitions. At the very least, a weak mandate would make that more difficult.

Brazilians have long been souring on their elected leaders, in part because of a corruption scandal that is arguably the largest in Latin American history. Launched in 2014, the so-called Carwash probe into kickbacks by construction companies has brought down many of the country's top businessmen and politicians. That includes former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who leads preference polls for October's election despite serving a 12-year-sentence for corruption.

Da Silva will most likely be barred from running, which is one of the factors expected to keep many supporters of his Workers' Party from voting. Many other former backers have long lost faith in the party, which was in power when much of the corruption was happening.

""I voted for Dilma Rousseff four years ago, but after her impeachment, and with Lula (likely) being banned, I don't feel like voting at all,"" said Thais Ramos, a telecommunications specialist. ""It is not because I reject totally whoever Lula endorses later, but I can't put faith in our democracy now.""

Voting is mandatory in Brazil, though the fine for not doing so — about $1 — has little influence on people who would prefer not to be bothered.

In the 2014 general elections, almost 19 percent of eligible Brazilian voters skipped the polls on Election Day. Nearly another 9 percent showed up but left their ballots blank. The end result: Rousseff was narrowly re-elected with 38 percent of the total potential electorate. Opponents of the Workers' Party immediately began talking about impeachment, based on allegations ranging from voter fraud to campaign finance violations. Eventually she was ousted for illegal management of the federal budget, allegations she strongly denies up to this day.

This election cycle, all indications are it will be worse. A Datafolha institute poll from June found that 28 percent of Brazilians had no intention to vote in the in the most likely scenario for the country's presidential election, with da Silva being replaced by former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad.

""A high number of no votes would not kill the legitimacy of the election from a legal perspective,"" said Claudio Lamachia, president of Brazil's bar association. ""But it makes our representation less legitimate.""

For months, politicians and electoral authorities have been urging voters to participate, the kind of get-out-the-vote rhetoric usually not seen until weeks before Election Day. That worry increased in June, when 50 percent of voters in state of Tocantins skipped a special election for governor.

So many people sitting it out could benefit Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, a former Army captain who garners both enthusiastic supporters and detractors. Bolsonaro's closest competitor is centrist Marina Silva, who lost presidential bids in 2010 and 2014. Both candidates capture between 15 and 20 percent of voter intentions, according to polls.

Also competitive but lagging behind with less than 10 percent are left-leaning Ciro Gomes, who has served in cabinet posts in previous administrations, and right-leaning, Geraldo Alckmin a former governor of Sao Paulo state.

Enthusiasm is so low for the field of candidates that analysts say rejection votes could determine the winner. The candidate who sparks the most condemnation is Bolsonaro, who has a long history of making racist, sexist and homophobic comments.

An Ibope poll also from June found Bolsonaro had very high disapproval ratings. Thirty-two percent of the electorate said under no condition would they vote for Bolsonaro, only one percentage point above da Silva. The next most rejected was Alckmin, referred to by many as the ""squash popsicle"" for being seen as bland. He was rejected by 22 percent of the electorate, according to the poll.

""I will only leave home if it is to block Bolsonaro. I might vote against him, but I am not voting for any of these candidates,"" said Guilherme Prado, a 44-year-old Uber driver who lives outside of Sao Paulo. ""None of these candidates give me the confidence that Brazil will be doing better next year.""",world

With poll-leading former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in jail and likely to be barred from running, Brazil's presidential election is wide open. A look at the five contenders with the best chances, according to polls:

JAIR BOLSONARO

The former army captain and seven-term congressman has tapped into deep unease in Brazil, which is reeling from a sweeping corruption scandal and is struggling to grow again after a protracted recession. Bolsonaro has expressed nostalgia for the 1964-1985 military dictatorship, has been repeatedly fined for offensive comments, and has made cracking down on crime a centerpiece of his campaign. He says he supports market-friendly economic policies but has given few details.

After da Silva, he garners the most support, between 17 to 19 percent in a recent Datafolha poll, where the margin of error was 2 percentage points. But Bolsonaro is backed by a small party that will get only a small share of the free TV air time allocated by law for campaigns. He will also have to overcome high unfavorability ratings.

MARINA SILVA

When da Silva's name is removed from polls, one of the main beneficiaries is Marina Silva, who once served as da Silva's environment minister. Silva, who draws between 10 and 15 percent support in the Datafolha poll, has a dramatic personal story: She suffered numerous illnesses and often went hungry as a child. She didn't learn to read and write until her teens. Silva nearly upended the last presidential race when her party's candidate died during the campaign and she took his place. She initially surged in polls, tapping into voter discontent and attracting Brazilians on both the left and right.

Back then and to this day, however, Silva has struggled to define herself, beyond her focus on environmental issues.

CIRO GOMES

The left-leaning Gomes, who has roots in da Silva's stronghold of the northeast, is another beneficiary when the former president is removed from polls. Gomes has extensive experience, having served as governor, mayor, minster and federal congressman, and would be prepared to navigate the halls of power in Brasilia from Day 1. He appeals to voters who are disgusted with dirty dealings so common in Brazilian politics, touting the fact that has remained clean, despite decades in public service.

Still, Gomes has struggled to unite the left — he attracted between 6 and 11 percent support in the Datafolha poll — and he has a reputation for being prickly and saying controversial things.

GERALDO ALCKMIN

A three-time governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest and richest state, Alckmin has a lot of executive experience. At a time when deteriorating public security is of growing concern to many voters, Alckmin can run on the city of Sao Paulo's remarkable reduction in its murder rate. He is a conservative who supports market-friendly economic policies, like scaling back the country's faltering social security system, making him the darling of investors.

But Alckmin lacks charisma and his poll numbers have been in the single digits. He also has high unfavorability ratings. However, Alckmin will get significant funding and free TV time because of the size of his Brazilian Social Democracy Party and alliances he has made.

WORKERS' PARTY SUBSTITUTION

Da Silva and his Workers' Party have insisted he is running, but most in Brazil expect him to eventually be barred from the race because of his conviction. The party has chosen former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad as its vice presidential candidate, and it looks likely he will assume the top spot if the Supreme Electoral Court rejects da Silva's candidacy.

Two-thirds of da Silva's supporters have indicated they would vote for whomever he endorses. The question is if that endorsement might come too late in the campaign to make much of a difference.",world
"A leading rightist presidential candidate blamed the left on Tuesday for Brazil's rise in crime as he promised to give further protection to one of the most lethal police forces in the world.

Legislator Jair Bolsonaro, who is running second in polls on the October election, published a platform of generic suggestions for the economy, education and health care. But he also loaded it with criticism of human rights groups and left-leaning politicians, accusing them of permissiveness that he says has fueled the rise in violence and drug use.

Bolsonaro registered the plan at Brazil's top electoral court in Brasilia, saying that ""policemen need to be sure they will be protected by a judicial backbone in the exercise of their professional activities.""

He calls for an extension of the right of self-defense, which human rights groups see as an authorization for police to kill without prosecution when they commit excesses.

A report released last week counted an average of 14 deaths a day at the hands of Brazilian police officers last year, which it said was a 20 percent increase over 2016.

Overall, a record 63,880 people were slain in Brazil in 2017, the report said. The South American country is the world leader in overall homicide numbers, and now its per-capita homicide rate is one of the highest.

In a crowded presidential field, Bolsonaro trails only jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in opinion polls, but the popular ex-leader is expected to be barred from the ballot by Brazil's electoral justice.

Bolsonaro released his platform on the same day that he faced questions about using government funds to pay for the upkeep of a vacation home.

He denied wrongdoing in payments to Walderice Conceicao dos Santos, listed by his office as a secretary.

The newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported Tuesday that Dos Santos had been fired following news reports that she actually worked selling acai in Angra dos Reis, about 105 miles (170 kilometers) southwest of Rio.

Bolsonaro told the newspaper that she helped take care of his vacation home near Angra dos Reis.

The congressman's office said that he had no further comment.",world

Five allied political parties endorsed the presidential nominee of the bigger right-leaning Brazilian Social Democracy Party on Thursday, giving a boost to the man seen as the establishment candidate in Brazil's fractured political landscape.

The candidate, conservative former Sao Paulo Gov. Geraldo Alckmin, has been struggling to top 10 percent in opinion polls ahead of the October elections. But with the group's endorsement, he will get more free air time on TV and radio during the presidential campaign plus the support of more than 1,000 mayors nationwide.

The five parties make up the ""Big Center"" coalition in Congress, holding 164 of 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 17 of 81 seats in the Senate. Many members of the five have been caught up in Brazil's sprawling ""Car Wash"" corruption investigation, which has jailed politicians and business executives across Latin America.

Leaders of the coalition said Alckmin's running mate will come from one of the five parties. His favorite for the role, textile business mogul Josue Gomes, refused it earlier Thursday.

Jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has been leading in the polls, but he is likely to be barred from running and substituted by another member of his left-leaning Workers' Party.

Far-right former military officer Jair Bolsonaro, environmentalist Marina Silva and left-leaning Ciro Gomes also lead Alckmin in the polls.

The Big Center group had earlier negotiated to endorse Gomes, but Alckmin prevailed after convincing leaders of the five parties that his candidacy is viable.

Political analyst Alberto Almeida, who has written several books on Brazilian elections, said Alckmin probably can thank unpopular President Michel Temer for the coalition's endorsement.

""It is clear that Temer wants Alckmin to win and carry on with his austerity measures. All those five parties also support Temer in Congress,"" Almeida said.

Almeida said the endorsement could help Alckmin in competing with Bolsonaro, who polls second now thanks to a hard-line rightist political base.

With no one expected to win the first round outright, the goal is to finish first or second and move on the expected runoff ballot Oct. 27.

""This agreement gives Alckmin a lot of free air time. Estimates now suggest the governor will have 60 free ads on TV daily against two of Bolsonaro's. That will play a role,"" Almeida said.

Alckmin ran for president in 2006, but lost to da Silva by big margins. He was governor of the wealthy Sao Paulo state until this March, when he had to resign to run for president.",world

Leaders of the conservative party that governs Germany's prosperous southern state of Bavaria urged members Saturday to close ranks ahead of next month's regional elections, in which the Christian Social Union is projected to suffer heavy losses.

""In the next four weeks we need confidence not fear, unity not bickering, commitment not complacency,"" Horst Seehofer, who heads the center-right CSU, said at a party convention in Munich.

Recent opinion polls predict the CSU could win just 35 percent of the vote on Oct. 14. In 2013, the party received almost 48 percent of votes, allowing it to govern alone.

Among the reasons cited for its electoral decline are the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has campaigned heavily against the influx of migrants in recent years, and a series of gaffes by Seehofer that have driven voters to other mainstream parties.

Earlier this month, Seehofer — who is Germany's interior minister — said the migrant issue was ""the mother of all political problems "" and backed the embattled head of the country's domestic intelligence agency in a public spat over anti-migrant violence in the eastern city of Chemnitz.

A coalition of more than a dozen groups representing migrants and their descendants in Germany released an open letter Saturday calling for Seehofer either to take a stronger stand against far-right extremism or to resign.

Bavaria's governor, Markus Soeder, said the Christian Social Union's poor showing in pre-election opinion polls could energize the party's supporters, who don't want the state governed by a coalition, as is the norm elsewhere in Germany.

The CSU has largely ruled Bavaria alone for over 60 years, but is part of Chancellor Angela Merkel's three-party coalition that governs at the national level.

""Fight, fight, fight,"" Soeder told party members at the Munich convention. ""It would be a shame to leave Bavaria to the wrong hands.""",world
"Hundreds of people were rescued in New Bern, N.C., on Friday as Tropical Storm Florence continued its assault on the Carolina coast after making landfall in the morning.

More than 360 people were rescued as of midafternoon Friday, but another 140 were still waiting for help, city spokeswoman Colleen Roberts told the Associated Press.

Sadie Marie Holt, 67, was among those rescued.

""The wind was so hard, the waters were so hard that, trying to get out, we got thrown into trailers. We got thrown into mailboxes. Houses. Trees,"" Holt said.

Holt, who has diabetes and clogged arteries, said she stayed for doctor's appointments that were canceled at the last minute.

She tried to row out of her neighborhood Thursday night with a boat that was in her yard after her home began to flood, but had to retreat because of the poor conditions.

Tom Ballance, New Bern resident and business owner, told the Weather Channel that he watched water rise around him while sitting in his home, according to the Charlotte Observer.

“Nobody expected this,” Ballance said. “We were fools.”

We’re a resilient community, we work well together, we’ll get through this."" - Dana Outlaw, Mayor of New Bern

New Bern, a city of about 29,000 people, sits on a peninsula between the Neuse and Trent rivers. Crews from the city and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) were working with citizen volunteers to get people to dry ground, Roberts said.

“We’re not going to be satisfied until the last resident is rescued and in a shelter, and then we can assess damages and go from there,” New Bern Mayor Dana Outlaw said, according to the Herald Sun of North Carolina.

When Florence started battering eastern North Carolina with record rainfall, the rivers began to swell — and combined with high tide, made for dangerous flooding.

The city has been placed under a 24-hour curfew until further notice, Roberts said, according to the Herald Sun.

“We’re a resilient community, we work well together, we’ll get through this,” Outlaw said.

""Nobody expected this. ... We were fools."" - Tom Ballance, New Bern resident and business owner

Roberts said early estimates show about 4,300 residences and 300 commercial buildings had been damaged.

She said that count is expected to increase significantly.

There had been no reports of injuries or fatalities, though most of the city was without power and thousands of buildings had been damaged, she said.

New Bern, a 300-year-old city that was once the state capital, is about a two-hour drive southeast of Raleigh.

Even though Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm, it already has proven deadly with its nearly nonstop rain, surging seawater and howling winds.

At least four people have died, but authorities fear the death toll with increase as the storm crawls westward Saturday across South Carolina.

"Police on Saturday were hunting for three men who allegedly drugged, kidnapped and raped a teenage girl while she was on her way to a test-preparation course in northern India earlier this week, in yet another incident of rising crimes against women.

Police officer Ashwini Kumar said the victim is in stable condition in a hospital in Haryana state and police have recorded her statement.

Violent crime against women has been on the rise in India despite tough laws that were enacted five years ago.

The Press Trust of India news agency quoted her father as saying she named three suspects who abducted her from a bus stop on Wednesday, but felt that 8-10 persons could have been in a village home where she was raped.

Indian media reports said the suspects were believed to be from her village and known to her. They dropped her later in their car at the pickup point in Mahendragarh, a town about 145 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of the Indian capital, New Delhi.

Kumar said the police know the identity of the suspects, but they have switched off their phones and were evading arrests.

The teenage victim suffered injuries on her back, shoulders and private parts, The Times of India newspaper reported.

India has been shaken by a series of sexual assaults since 2012, when a student was gang-raped and murdered on a moving New Delhi bus. That attack galvanized a country where widespread violence against women had long been quietly accepted.

While the government has passed a series of laws increasing punishment for rape of an adult to 20 years in prison, it's rare for more than a few weeks to pass without another brutal sexual assault being reported.

Responding to widespread outrage over the recent rape and killings of young girls and other attacks on children, India's government in April approved the death penalty for people convicted of raping children under age 12.",world
"Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm on Friday after making landfall earlier in the day in North Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane, weather officials said.

The agency's update came after Florence claimed its first victims Friday afternoon, when two people died after a tree fell on their home in Wilmington, North Carolina, police said. There have been at least four deaths in the midst of the storm, according to officials.

Florence was about 15 miles north-northeast of Myrtle Beach, S.C., and about 55 miles east-southeast of Florence, S.C., the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in an 8 p.m. update.

Moving westward at 3 mph, Florence has maximum sustained winds of 70 mph, according to the NHC.

""On the forecast track, the center of Florence will move farther inland across extreme eastern South Carolina tonight and Saturday,"" the NHC said. ""Florence will then move generally northward across the western Carolinas and the central Appalachian Mountains early next week.""

As the storm travels inland, ""significant weakening"" is expected through to early next week, the NHC said.

Among the fatalities so far is a person in Lenoir County who died while plugging in a generator, according to a news release from North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper's office.

""Our hearts go out to the families of those who died in this storm,"" Cooper said in the news release. ""Hurricane Florence is going to continue its violent grind across our state for days. Be extremely careful and stay alert.""

HURRICANE FLORENCE'S PATH: TRACK THE STORM HERE

The storm's first fatalities were a mother and infant, police said on Twitter. The father sustained injuries and was transported to New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington for medical care.

Earlier Friday, the Wilmington Police tweeted that they were responding.

Dangerous storm surge as a result of Florence continued to be a threat, while forecasters said ""catastrophic freshwater flooding"" was likely to occur over parts of the Carolinas.

A storm surge warning was in effect from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina through to Salvo, North Carolina, as well as the Pamlico Sound in North Carolina, the update said.

Areas from Edisto Beach, South Carolins to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as the Pamlico Sound, were under a tropical storm warning.

Gov. Roy Cooper said earlier Friday that Florence is ""wreaking havoc"" and he's concerned ""whole communities"" could be wiped away.

""Hurricane Florence is powerful, slow and relentless,"" he said. ""It's an uninvited brute who doesn't want to leave.""

President Trump, who in an earlier tweet praised FEMA, first responders and law enforcement for their response to Florence, is planning to visit storm-affected areas next week, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. The trip will take place once its confirmed that it won't get in the way of rescue or recovery efforts, she said.

SHIRTLESS MAN STARES DOWN HURRICANE WITH FLAG IN HAND: 'JUST BEING FREE AND AMERICAN'

Preparing for the worst, about 9,700 National Guard troops and civilians were deployed with high-water vehicles, helicopters and boats that could be used to pluck people from the floodwaters.

More than 600,000 people had already lost power by 1 p.m. Friday, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety reported.

Duke Energy said in a tweet that they expect 1 to 3 million outages across the Carolinas, adding that ""restoration in the hardest-hit communities could take weeks.""

Officials said some 1.7 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were warned to evacuate, but it's unclear how many did. The homes of about 10 million were under watches or warnings for the hurricane or tropical storm conditions.

"Thousands of Iranians attended a massive funeral for 135 soldiers on Thursday, 30 years after the end of the 1980s war between Iran and Iraq.

Trucks carried the caskets draped in the Iranian flag in the capital Tehran. They were encircled by mourners including women shrouded in black Islamic robes, many of them weeping as a brass band played for the procession. State TV reported that only 17 bodies have been identified.

The farewell began Wednesday evening outside a war museum in northern Tehran, where mourners gathered to say goodbye to the soldiers.

""I always visit caskets of unknown soldiers wondering if one of them could be my father who never came back home,"" said Zahra Bagheri, 42, a mother of two. ""I was only 8 years old then. I hope someday I can point to one of the caskets and tell my children 'he is your grandpa!'""

Abbas Mozaffari, 23, a student at Tehran Azad University, said he attend the ceremony to ""show that Iranians remember their heroes. Like them, we will sacrifice ourselves for our nation if an enemy tries to put his foot on our soil.""

""This is a chance for me to feel that I am still in the same trench with my comrades,"" said 63-year-old war veteran Ahad Ebrahimi.

The remains belong to soldiers killed in three different operations in southwest Iran between 1984 and 1986. They include the cutting off of Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf and the 1986 collapse of the strategic city of al-Faw in the Basra governorate in southern Iraq.

The funeral came a week after protesters in the city of Basra stormed the Iranian consulate and torched government buildings while blaming Iran's influence on Iraq's political affairs for failing services, despite current close relations between the countries.

"An explosion rocked the city of Sun Prairie, Wis., on Tuesday after a contractor struck a natural gas main, leveling buildings and injuring at least two firefighters and one police officer, authorities said.

No deaths were immediately reported, said Lt. Kevin Konopacki of the Sun Prairie Police Department. The firefighters were rushed to a hospital, while the officer and some residents were treated at the scene.

Multiple buildings around Main Street, an area filled with bars, restaurants and other businesses, were leveled, Madison's WISC-TV reported, citing police.

Firefighters and police responded to a reported gas leak in the city’s downtown area around 6:20 p.m., before the explosion, authorities said. They were evacuating a five-block radius when the explosion occurred, likely saving lives.

WE Energies spokeswoman Cathy Schulze said the gas main strike was reported to the utility ahead of the blast, and first responders were working to shut off the gas to secure the area.

Contractors had apparently punctured a 4-inch main that sent natural gas leaking into a building, WE Energies spokeswoman Amy Jahns said.

The blast was reported around 7:15 p.m., and appeared to be centered on the Barr House, a local pub. Video posted to social media shows fires blazing with smoke billowing toward the sky amid a heavy police presence.

Firefighters were battling flames for more than three hours after the blast, Konpacki said. The buildings would be searched once the fires were out.

An employee of Madison's WMTV-TV said his ""whole house shook"" from the explosion.

The first inter-Korean summit of 2018, a sunny spectacle in late April, reduced war fears on the peninsula. The second, an emergency one in May, helped ensure a historic meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump came off.

Now, at his third summit with Kim next week in Pyongyang, South Korean President Moon Jae-in faces his toughest challenge yet: delivering something substantive that goes beyond previous vague statements on denuclearization and helps get U.S.-North Korea talks back on track.

Negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have sputtered in recent weeks, raising doubts about whether Kim is truly willing to relinquish his nuclear arsenal and putting pressure on Moon to broker progress once again.

The result will likely be a crucial indicator of how the larger nuclear negotiations with the United States will proceed. Moon will try to get Kim to express more clearly that he's prepared to abandon his nuclear weapons, which could create momentum for a second Kim-Trump summit.

Whether Moon succeeds, fails or falls somewhere in between, the third inter-Korean summit could help answer a persistent question: When Kim says he supports the ""complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" what does he actually mean?

___

DENUCLEARIZATION DEBATE

Moon heads to Pyongyang on Tuesday facing lingering questions over his claim that Kim, during his conversations with South Korean officials, has privately expressed a genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons and missiles.

The wave of optimism that surrounded the first two inter-Korean summits in April and May and the Singapore meeting between Trump and Kim in June conveniently overlooked disagreements about what exactly Kim had committed to.

""The third summit will bring more clarity to what North Korea means with the complete denuclearization of the peninsula,"" said Kim Taewoo, former president of Seoul's government-funded Korea Institute for National Unification. ""If the North has been negotiating with goodwill all this time, Moon will be able to return with good results. But, regrettably, I see that possibility as low.""

He said it will be crucial for Moon to get Kim Jong Un to give a clearer signal that he is willing to accept credible actions toward denuclearization, such as providing a detailed description of North Korea's nuclear program, a key first step toward inspecting and dismantling of it.

At his meetings with Moon and Trump, Kim signed statements pledging the complete denuclearization of the peninsula. But the North for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops from South Korea and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.

The differences prompted Trump to cancel Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's planned visit to North Korea last month. After an earlier Pompeo visit, Pyongyang accused Washington of making ""unilateral and gangster-like"" demands on denuclearization and bristled at the idea that it must take significant steps toward dismantling its nuclear program before a peace treaty is signed or international sanctions are lifted.

Moon, the son of North Korean war refugees, is eager to keep the nuclear diplomacy alive, not just to keep a lid on tensions, but also to advance his ambitious plans for engagement with the North, including joint economic projects and reconnecting inter-Korean roads and railways. These projects are held back by the sanctions against North Korea.

""What the South and North now needs is not just another joint declaration, but finding ways to substantially develop relations,"" Moon said in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. ""We cannot cease our efforts to mediate and facilitate talks from the middle until dialogue and communication between North Korea and the United States flow smoothly.""

GETTING IT IN WRITING

The issue of declaring a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War will be high on the agenda in Pyongyang. The fighting stopped with an armistice that has left the peninsula technically at war.

Both Koreas are calling for a declaration by the end of the year, but the U.S. wants to see more concrete steps toward denuclearization first, and some analysts say a declaration could put pressure on the U.S. to withdraw its troops from South Korea.

""With the declaration, North Korea's trying to put itself on equal footing with the United States so it could turn the process into a bilateral arms reduction negotiation between two nuclear states,"" Kim, the security expert, said. ""The process can't have anything to do with a plan to denuclearize unilaterally.""

Chung Eui-yong, Moon's national security adviser, met Kim in Pyongyang earlier this month, and said the North Korean leader told him that an end-of-war declaration would not weaken the U.S.-South Korea alliance or lead to a withdrawal of U.S. troops. Chung also said Kim wishes to realize denuclearization before the end of Trump's first term.

Chung conveyed similarly promising comments from Kim after a previous visit in March, when South Korean officials shuttled between Pyongyang and Washington to set up the Trump-Kim meeting.

He said then that Kim had said the North would not need to keep its nuclear weapons if it received a credible security guarantee and that the North Korean leader understood that U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises must continue. The comments were seen as an important departure from North Korea's previous stance.

But Kim has never made similar comments publicly or in writing.

If Moon can't convince Kim to express a commitment to concrete denuclearization steps, he will at least have to get Kim to put the things Chung has said he was told in a written agreement, said Du Hyeogn Cha, a visiting scholar at Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

That would provide a starting point for establishing a timeline for denuclearization, reduce concerns over North Korea's intent and make it clearer that the North bears the greater responsibility in the efforts to resolve the nuclear crisis, Cha said.

""The Panmunjom Declaration after the first summit only provided a time limit for the end-of-war declaration, which was the end of 2018; on denuclearization, the statement just said the Koreas would jointly work toward it,"" Cha said. ""A failure to get something more specific out of Kim could cause the diplomatic efforts to lose much of their force.""

Filipinos are facing the powerful Typhoon Mangkhut with the memory of another devastating storm still fresh in their minds.

Nearly five years ago, Typhoon Haiyan left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines — well to the south of Mangkhut's path. Haiyan demolished about a million houses and displaced more than 4 million people in one of the country's poorest regions.

The Associated Press is republishing this Nov. 13, 2013, story written by Todd Pitman in Tacloban, the city hardest hit by the typhoon.

Two days before the typhoon hit, officials rolled through this city with bullhorns, urging residents to get to higher ground or take refuge in evacuation centers. Warnings were broadcast on state television and radio.

Some left. Some didn't.

Residents steeled themselves for the high winds, floods and mudslides that routinely come with the typhoons that afflict this tropical nation. But virtually no one was prepared for Typhoon Haiyan's storm surge, a 6-meter-high (20-foot-high) wall of water headed straight for them.

""It was supposed to be safe,"" said Linda Maie, who stayed in her one-room house more than half a kilometer (mile) inland. She had heard the warnings but said her Tacloban (tuk-LOH-ban) neighborhood ""has never even flooded in my 61 years.""

Her family stocked up on canned food, water and candles and covered their TV, laptops and appliances in plastic bags. But when her 16-year-old daughter, Alexa Wung, awoke at 5 a.m. Friday to howling winds and heavy rain, it was clear that Haiyan was not a typical storm.

The house was shaking. Its wooden door frame and window hinges were banging. Peeking through the windows, Alexa saw doors and screens flying and crashing.

Their neighborhood was coming apart.

Water began seeping in through the doorway as Alexa huddled in the tiny house with her mother and brother. Then it burst through like an explosion, ripping half the door off and quickly flooding the room with knee-high water. Within minutes, it was chest-high.

By now, the family was on the dining table, watching in horror. Alexa's brother, Victor Vincent, glanced at the ceiling as the precious pocket of air grew smaller. They thought of escaping, but Linda couldn't swim.

Alexa checked her cell phone. It was 8:30 a.m. The icon for her mobile service provider was replaced with a circle with a slash through it.

""I knew then that even if we could scream for help, nobody in the world could hear us,"" Alexa said. ""We were cut off from everything.""

And the water was still rising.

It would be more than a day before the outside world knew what had happened.

Haiyan was among the most powerful typhoons on record when it struck, with wind estimates at landfall as high as 315 kph (195 mph). But the first news reports hours later suggested that it had moved across the islands so fast that the country might have escaped a major catastrophe. The reality was that Tacloban and other hard-hit communities had been cut off, with electricity and cell phone towers knocked out.

The worries, in Talcoban and around the world, had been on the wind much more than the water. That's why many of the 800,000 people who were evacuated found themselves in seemingly sturdy concrete buildings that could not protect them when the storm surge sea water pushed by the typhoon rushed in.

""Everybody knew a big storm was coming,"" said Mark Burke, an American native of Washington state who lives in Tacloban with his three small children and worked as a civilian pilot on contracts supporting U.S. naval forces in the region. ""But I had no idea it was going to be this hell. ... Nobody imagined what was about to happen.""

The water rose so high that some residents punched holes in their roofs with their bare hands to escape.

Burke and his kids hid in a bedroom until a wall of mud came through the doors. The master bed was floating.

""Then we all got on the piano, and it started floating through the hallway,"" he said. ""The water kept rising, and we eventually climbed up into the attic and stayed there for a day and a half.""

In another part of Tacloban, Eflide Bacsal was standing in the kitchen of her family's home when the wall of water hit with a furious roar.

""It was like a bomb BOOM!"" said her 23-year-old sister, Gennette Bacsal. ""It felt like an earthquake.""

The wave smashed through the windows and swept Eflide off her feet, sucking the 26-year-old under the swirling water. She frantically waved her arms, trying to find something to grasp. Her fingers closed around the power cord to the refrigerator. She held on as tight as she could and tried to pull herself to the surface, but the water only pushed her deeper.

She couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Couldn't see. In her panic, she began swallowing water. Everything went black. She felt herself dying. She surrendered.

And then, a hand appeared her father's. He grabbed her shirt and yanked her to the surface.

He hauled Eflide to the second floor of their home, where they waited along with Eflide's sisters and mother until the surge had passed.

Other family members were less fortunate. Relatives including Eflide and Gennette's brother, 38-year-old Gonathan Bacsal, had taken refuge in a church, but they fled as water rushed in. As they ran through nearby woods, a cousin was decapitated by a piece of metal that whizzed through the air.

Young and elderly relatives who could not swim were trapped by the rising water, but the family said Gonathan rescued many of them. He, too, was killed by debris: The storm blew several nails and a shard of metal into his neck.

As Alexa and her family stood on their dining table, they contemplated their own deaths. The water was at Alexa's chest, and her mother's chin.

""Where will we go? What can we hang on to?"" Alexa cried.

They were still amazed by the flood. No typhoon could cause this, Alexa thought.

Then her mother was splashed by water on her lips. It was salty. It dawned on them: This was from the sea.

Fish flittered across Alexa's back, and she recoiled in a panic.

The family was at their very limit, and so, thankfully, was the storm. The water stopped rising, and began, very slowly, to recede. It was again knee-high by the time Alexa walked outside.

Their neighborhood, of barber shops and restaurants and homes and streets filled with small buses known here as jeepneys, was gone. There was only a vast sea of debris: wooden beams filled with nails, shattered toilets and glass, concrete rubble, uprooted trees, twisted power transformers.

Survivors wandered, dazed and wounded, covered in mud and grime. Many were barefoot with seeping gashes in their feet and bruises all over. Some covered their wounds with cloth, or diapers.

""Tacloban was unrecognizable,"" Alexa said. ""It was as if Tacloban never existed at all.""

There was something else in the flatted landscape: corpses. And five days after Haiyan leveled Tacloban, many are still there.

Scores of them lay at roadsides for authorities to retrieve, covered with whatever people could find corrugated iron rooftop slabs, wooden planks, cardboard, a broken desk drawer.

Two bodies wrapped in white tarps lay on a bus-stop bench. Another sat on the ground below. People rolling luggage and carrying backpacks walked past, covering their mouths to protect against the sickly stench.

One orange dump truck moved through the city to collect the remains. Emergency workers unloaded a dozen of them at building that once sold souvenirs. In all, there were more than 170 bodies in black bags, spread side by side.

Bulldozers have cleared debris from most main streets, but the sidewalks are filled with everything imaginable: broken speakers, typewriters, cables, artificial Christmas trees.

There have been no major food distributions. The city's main hospital has been gutted. Medicines are running out. Police can be seen chasing scavengers through the streets.

International humanitarian organizations have yet to arrive. With no tents, people are sleeping in destroyed homes. One family took shelter in the shade of a giant uprooted tree, and cooked under a ripped gray rooftop held down with a broken basketball pole.

And some people are even farther away from help. On Tuesday, military helicopters flew 15 minutes from Tacloban to the wasteland of a town called Tanawan, past a lake with bodies still floating in it and over bridges that had collapsed.

Amid the ruins, desperate residents frantically waved their arms. Many had scrawled desperate messages in the ruins: ""HELP! FOOD. WATER."" Some messages appeared to be in chalk. One cry for help was spelled out in white clothing.

Today, American and Filipino C-130 cargo aircraft roar constantly at the Tacloban airport. Each plane can only take out around 150 people, and every flight is a disappointment to hundreds of residents left behind on the tarmac.

Gennette and Eflide have made it to Cebu. Burke and his kids flew to Manila.

Alexa and her mother walked two hours to the ravaged airport terminal in hopes of leaving. Victor asked them to leave, so he could worry about guarding the house instead of feeding them.

They were near the front of the flight line on Tuesday. But after a C-130 landed, the crowd surged to try to get to the plane. The crush of people was so intense that a 7-year-old girl passed out. Alexa and Linda could not endure it and stepped away.

They sat on a curb, under an umbrella. Alexa was in tears. Their destroyed city lay behind them, an apocalyptic graveyard marked with disfigured trees and ruin. They said the government, and the world, had done nothing to help them.

Their new plan: to leave Tacloban by bus and reach relatives in Manila.

Alexa said she will return, eventually.

""Filipinos have a saying: Weeds don't die easily,"" she said. ""When it's safe, when there is electricity, when it's livable, I'll come back.""

The Latest on Typhoon Mangkhut hitting the Philippines (all times local):

2:10 a.m.

Philippine forecasters say Typhoon Mangkhut has slammed into the country's northeastern coast. Witnesses say the storm's ferocious wind and blinding rain ripped off tin roof sheets and knocked down power at the start of the onslaught.

Forecasters said early Saturday that the typhoon made landfall in the coastal town of Baggao in Cagayan province nearly two hours after midnight in the northern tip of the main Luzon island. It is an agricultural region of flood-prone rice plains and mountain provinces often hit by landslides.

More than 5 million people are at risk from the storm, which the Hawaii-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center categorizes as a super typhoon with powerful winds and gusts equivalent to a category 5 Atlantic hurricane.

___

12:05 a.m.

Philippine authorities were evacuating thousands of people from the path of the most powerful typhoon this year, closing schools, readying bulldozers for landslides and placing rescuers and troops on full alert in the country's north.

More than 4 million people live in areas at most risk from the storm, which the Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii categorized as a super typhoon with powerful winds and gusts equivalent to a category 5 Atlantic hurricane.

Typhoon Mangkhut is on course to hit northeastern Cagayan province early Saturday. It was tracked on Friday about 400 kilometers (250 miles) away in the Pacific with sustained winds of 205 kilometers (127 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 255 kph (158 mph), Philippine forecasters said.

With a massive raincloud band 900 kilometers (560 miles) wide, combined with seasonal monsoon rains, the typhoon could bring heavy to intense rains that could set off landslides and flash floods, the forecasters said. Storm warnings have been raised in 25 provinces across the main northern island of Luzon, restricting sea and air travel.",world

The chair umpire who penalized Serena Williams in the U.S. Open final is back at work.

Carlos Ramos is working the best-of-five Davis Cup semifinal series between Croatia and the United States.

""I'm just focusing on this tie and working again. That's all I can say,"" Ramos told The Associated Press on Friday.

Ramos officiated the second singles match between Marin Cilic and Frances Tiafoe, which was completed without incident.

Ramos calmed the raucous crowd on several occasions and came down from his chair to check a few ball marks in the clay but otherwise had no impact on the match, which Cilic won in straight sets to give Croatia a 2-0 lead.

""It was great. There were even a few calls where he came to check. Everything was really good,"" Cilic said. ""The atmosphere was also great. I enjoyed every single second of the match.""

Tiafoe, who was making his Davis Cup debut, also didn't have any complaints.

""I didn't know Ramos was sitting in the chair. I really wasn't paying attention,"" Tiafoe said. ""I was more worried about the person across the net than the official.""

U.S. captain Jim Courier added: ""We thought the officiating was excellent all day long.""

Ramos gave Williams three code violations in her straight-set loss to Naomi Osaka last weekend, and the American great argued she wasn't being treated the same as some male players.

USTA president and CEO Katrina Adams, who defended Williams, was overheard apologizing to Ramos on the sidelines of Thursday's draw ceremony.

Ramos wouldn't go into details over his discussion with Adams, who initiated the conversation.

""You know I cannot talk about that,"" Ramos said.

"In the days after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico as the most destructive storm in the modern history of the island, a poll by a U.S. market research company added insult to injury. The Morning Consult survey found that nearly half of adults in the U.S. didn't know people born in the territory, which is about 1,200 miles southeast of Florida, are American citizens by birth.

But a lack of knowledge about Puerto Rico predates the storm.

Here is a look at the history and key issues facing the island:

THE BEGINNING

The U.S. has had a fraught relationship with the island since the late 19th century. Spain ceded it to the U.S in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, and Congress declared it an ""unincorporated"" territory in 1917 in an act that granted U.S. citizenship to people born in Puerto Rico. At the outset, the island functioned much like a colony, with Congress allowed to overrule any local legislation and the president given power to appoint a governor. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the U.S. authorized the island to elect its own governor and draft a constitution. In 1952, it was re-christened the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and a semi-autonomous relationship was codified, establishing that the U.S. has jurisdiction over national matters such as trade and foreign relations while the island's bi-cameral legislature and governor have control over local matters.

ITS STATUS

Throughout this history, the people of Puerto Rico have been split over whether they want independence, statehood or some form of the semi-autonomous relationship. The debate over the island's ""status"" is the central feature of its politics and divides its major political parties.

The federal government has long said that it would accept a change in the status of the Puerto Rico if the people of the island clearly supported the decision. But for decades, they have been divided between those who favor statehood and those who want to maintain the commonwealth, perhaps with some changes. A small minority continue to favor independence.

The last referendum, in 2017, strongly favored statehood but opponents questioned the validity of the vote because of low turnout.

The hitch is that any change would have to be approved by Congress. Statehood legislation, with support from Republicans and Democrats, was introduced in June but appears unlikely to gain momentum as politicians remain hesitant to take up such a thorny issue.

SEMI-AUTONOMY IN PRACTICE

Both Spanish and English are official languages on the island, but the former is more widely spoken. Puerto Ricans often refer to their island as ""el pais,"" the Spanish word for country. Puerto Rico fields its own Olympic team and has its own cultural identity.

But Puerto Ricans can fly back and forth from the mainland without showing their U.S. passports. The more than 5 million people of Puerto Rican descent on the mainland outnumber the 3.3 million on the island. Puerto Ricans also serve in the U.S. military and many, if not most, consider themselves as American as anyone else in the country.

They do have, however, second-class political status. Residents of the island cannot cast a ballot in the U.S. presidential election, have no representatives in the Senate, and send only a non-voting member to the U.S. House of Representatives. While they don't pay U.S. personal income tax, they still must contribute for Medicare and Social Security and pay income taxes to the Puerto Rican government.

DEBT CRISIS

The U.S. federal government is now exerting an increased level of financial control over the island because of its debt crisis.

Financial turmoil is the result of massive borrowing to cover deficits over a decade-long economic recession sparked by the expiration of a manufacturing tax credit. Congress created a financial oversight board in 2016 in exchange for granting Puerto Rico a legal mechanism to restructure public debt that had spiraled to more than $70 billion.

But that proved deeply unpopular on the island, where the board's insistence on budget and benefit cuts prompted fierce protests.

HURRICANE MARIA

Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico as a category 4 storm on Sept. 20, 2017. It bashed the island for 12 hours, destroying the electric power grid and thousands of homes, businesses and government buildings. Puerto Ricans were also left with no power and water, no cell phone service, and a sense that the U.S. government had been ill-prepared for the disaster — which the Federal Emergency Management Agency later conceded was true.

Regardless of the relationship between the U.S. and Puerto Rico, the storm is proving to be an expensive disaster for all American taxpayers. The federal government says it has already spent more than $3 billion for recovery efforts. The government of Puerto Rico says the total cost of recovery over the next decade will be more than $100 billion, and it says it will need help from Congress to foot that bill.",world
"Prosecutors in El Salvador are investigating the alleged diversion of some $10 million in funds donated by Taiwan and purportedly used to pay for political campaigning by the governing party.

Prosecutor Douglas Melendez said Thursday in a TV interview that the money came from $38 million that Taipei gave to the Foreign Ministry for various projects.

Melendez alleged the funds were diverted to the presidency and ""apparently used in a partisan campaign"" under then President Mauricio Funes in elections won by current President Salvador Sanchez Ceren, an FMLN party ally of Funes.

Melendez said ex-Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez has been questioned because it was under his watch that the money was allegedly passed to the presidency.

Martinez is the party's candidate for the presidential election next year.

The FMLN party political commission issued a statement calling the accusations ""baseless"" and accusing Melendez of ""attacking our candidate and our party in a slanderous and irresponsible way.""

Martinez said in a press statement that he wasn't in the foreign ministry during the time period mentioned. ""I am not prepared to allow my reputation to be sullied with irresponsible statements based on electoral politics,"" he said.

Recently El Salvador switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to mainland China, though there was no suggestion of any link between that change and the investigation.

Earlier this week, former President Tony Saca of the Arena party was sentenced to 10 years in prison for embezzlement and money laundering along with several associates who also pleaded guilty.

Melendez said these investigations show that ""nobody wears a crown in this country. Nobody is above the law.""

Funes was president from 2009 to 2014. He and multiple former officials and family members are accused of corruption.

He is currently in Nicaragua, where he was granted asylum. He denies wrongdoing.",world

The Syrian army, backed by allies Iran and Russia, is preparing for a military offensive to retake the country's last major rebel stronghold —the province of Idlib.

The battle could bring an end to a seven-year-old uprising-turned-civil war, but at the cost of a humanitarian disaster on a scale yet unseen in the bloody conflict. Some 3 million civilians are trapped in Idlib, along with tens of thousands of opposition fighters, including hard-core militants.

In recent days, Syrian and Russian warplanes stepped up bombings, targeting the southern edge of the province and signaling a slow start to the campaign.

Here's a look at the issues involved:

___

WHO IS IN IDLIB?

Idlib is located in the northwestern corner of Syria. It is ringed by Turkey to the northwest, the Turkish-controlled Afrin region to the northeast and government-controlled territory to the southwest and southeast. A vital highway linking the cities of Aleppo and Damascus, known as the M5, cuts through Idlib's eastern flank.

The province fell into rebel hands in early 2015. It is now home to a dizzying array of opposition fighters, Islamic militants and jihadis. An alliance known as Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by al-Qaeda affiliates formerly known as the Nusra Front, dominates the province. Another rebel umbrella group called the National Front for Liberation is backed by Turkey.

An estimated 50,000 rebels, including more than 10,000 hard-core militants and al-Qaida-linked fighters, are cornered in Idlib. With nowhere left to go, some might opt to fight till death rather than surrender.

Turkey also maintains a troop presence — hundreds of soldiers deployed at 12 observation posts in Idlib. Syrian government forces have massed to the south and southwest of the province.

___

WHY IS IT A POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE?

An estimated 3 million people live in Idlib, nearly half of them having arrived there after being displaced by fighting elsewhere in Syria. Among the civilians are close to 1 million children, according to rights groups.

The province saw its population swell drastically as rebels and civilians were being sent there from other opposition strongholds after they capitulated to government forces.

A full-scale air and ground offensive is likely to send waves of refugees surging toward the sealed Turkey border, coinciding with the onset of winter. A top U.N. official has warned that an attack on Idlib could lead to this century's worst loss of life.

Even a partial offensive focusing on specific areas of Idlib could displace hundreds of thousands of people and cut off aid access to the province. Most aid currently enters through the Bab al-Hawa crossing with Turkey.

___

WHAT HAPPENS IF CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE USED?

U.N. investigators have previously attributed several chemical attacks in Syria to government forces, including one attack using the nerve agent Sarin gas against the Idlib town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017.

In the run-up to a possible Idlib offensive, the Syrian government and Russia have alleged that rebels in Idlib are planning to use chemical weapons to frame the government and induce Western punitive airstrikes.

The U.S. has pushed back, with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis saying this week that ""right now we see zero evidence that the opposition has any chemical capability, notwithstanding what Russia has been broadcasting repeatedly.""

The U.S. says it will retaliate harshly to any chemical weapons attack by President Bashar Assad's forces and has suggested such internationally prohibited weapons are being readied for the battlefield.

Twice before, the U.S. has resorted to missile strikes in response to chemical weapons attacks, only to see them used again.

___

CAN BLOODSHED BE AVERTED?

The presidents of Russia, Iran and Turkey met last week in Tehran to consider alternatives, but failed to reach a consensus. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani back military action, despite a cease-fire call by their Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The U.N. envoy for Syria has told the U.N. Security Council there are signs the three leaders intend to continue talking.

Turkey stands to lose the most from a battle on its border that is sure to have a destabilizing effect on the country and areas it controls inside Syria.

In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this week, Erdogan warned that an Idlib offensive would ""create serious humanitarian and security risks for Turkey, the rest of Europe and beyond."" He said it would amount to ""indiscriminate attacks to wipe out its opposition and not a genuine or effective campaign against terrorism.""

For Russia and Iran, recapturing Idlib would deal a decisive defeat to the opposition and stamp out the last remains of the rebellion against Assad that began in 2011.

While an assault to retake Idlib appears to be inevitable, there are ongoing talks on ways to separate the militants from the civilians.

Proposals include urging Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham to dissolve itself or join the Turkey-backed rebels. This would supposedly bring the group more under Turkish control and make it easier to deal with. But there are thousands of foreign jihadis among Idlib's fighters, including Chechens and Chinese.

Another proposal is to open humanitarian corridors through which civilians could leave to government-controlled areas, although that suggestion has yet to gain any traction.

___

WHAT IS THE U.S. ROLE?

Despite dire U.S. warnings and fears of a humanitarian disaster, the Trump administration has little leverage to stop Russia, Iran and Syria from pressing ahead with the Idlib offensive.

Washington has threatened military action in case of a chemical weapons attack but its mixed messaging on retaining a U.S. presence in Syria and a cut in aid has diminished its already limited influence over the conflict.

American airstrikes launched against Assad government assets have had limited impact in the past.

Another tool in the U.S. arsenal is economic pressure, but sanctions have been ineffectual since they first began to be applied during the Obama administration.

"The son of a police captain, who was one of the first responders to the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for plotting a similar ISIS-inspired attack on a college campus.

Alexander Ciccolo, who went by the name Ai Al Amriki, was sentenced on Wednesday after pleading guilty in May to terrorism charges. He admitted to attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and attempting to use weapons of mass destruction, among other charges.

It was his father, Capt. Robert Ciccolo, who alerted authorities after he said his son stated he wanted to join the Islamic State group.

Ciccolo, 26, was arrested in July 2015 after purchasing four guns from someone who was cooperating with the FBI. Prosecutors said he also planned to use homemade bombs similar to the pressure cookers used in the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon attack. Ciccolo was seen buying a pressure cooker shortly before his arrest.

He also posted a photo of his Facebook page of Boston Marathon Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with the words, “JUSTICE FOR JAHAR KEEP THE HOPE,” prosecutors say.

Authorities have described Ciccolo as a “committed soldier” of the Islamic State group who was devoted to inflicting “maximum damage” upon the United States.

Ciccolo’s father has not spoken publically about the conviction, but his son’s lawyers have said that he did not believe his son would or could have followed through with the attack. His mother, Shelley MacInnes, said on New England Public radio last year that her son is “very compassionate,” and “would not hurt a fly.”

"Two powerful earthquakes rocked Japan within 20 minutes of each other early Thursday, just over a day after a typhoon in the country left at least six people dead.

The quakes — magnitude-6.6 and -5.3 — struck Tomakomai, the fifth largest city in the Hokkaido area, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). They each had a depth of roughly 21 and 23 miles, respectively.

The city lost power after the quakes hit, officials said. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's chief cabinet secretary said officials are working to assess the damage and help those in need.

NHK World, a public broadcaster in Japan, reported that the quakes caused ""huge landslides"" in the area. The country's meteorological agency said there are no threats of a tsunami.

On Tuesday, the strongest typhoon to make landfall in Japan since 1993 was recorded. It first made landfall on Japan's southwestern island of Shikoku and then again near Kobe on Honshu.

"A Thai soccer team of young boys and their coach who were rescued from a cave in July made an appearance at a Bangkok exhibition Thursday where they spoke to the public and reportedly navigated through a fake cave tunnel made to look like the one they were trapped in.

The team of 12, seeming upbeat, coursed through a tunnel spanning roughly 32 feet that also included a feature that emulates dripping water, according to Sky News.

The team appeared at the public exhibition, held at a shopping mall, before attending a reception as the guests of honor, which was thrown by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and his wife. The event was organized to pay tribute to those who helped rescue the team.

For more than two weeks the soccer team’s 25-year-old coach and the group of 12 players, who ranged from 11 to 16 years old, were trapped in the cave. The team’s extraction occurred over a three day period as the country’s annual monsoons flooded the cave, prompting a massive and frenzied search and rescue operation. The entire group was pulled out by July 10.

"A German teenager has been arrested on suspicion he was planning an Islamic extremist bombing attack in the Frankfurt area, prosecutors said Thursday.

Frankfurt prosecutors' spokesman Sinan Akdogan told The Associated Press the 17-year-old was arrested by Hesse state police Sept. 1 and ordered held by a judge on suspicion of preparing a serious act of violence.

The information leading to the arrest, provided by the United States, indicated the suspect was planning to attack a gay nightclub in Frankfurt and a Catholic church in the city, according to an official with access to intelligence information, who discussed it on condition of anonymity.

Akdogan would not comment on the target or the source of the information, citing the ongoing investigation, but said state police had been acting on information received through Germany's domestic intelligence agency.

At the time of his arrest, the suspect had instructions on how to make explosives known as TATP and was trying to procure chemicals online, Akdogan said.

It was not clear how advanced the preparations were but Akdogan said small amounts of chemicals were found during a search of the suspect's home in Florstadt, northeast of Frankfurt.

The suspect's name was withheld for privacy reasons and Akdogan said he could not give further details on the planned attack.

Germany has previously had success with American intelligence information helping thwart plots, most notably in 2007 in stopping a plan to bomb the U.S. Air Force's Ramstein Air Base in southern Germany.

In that case, following a tip from the U.S., German officials put under surveillance four members of the radical Islamic Jihad Union and covertly replaced the hydrogen peroxide they had collected to use for their bombs with a diluted substitute that could not have been used to produce an explosive.

That allowed them to build a case over time and four men were eventually arrested and convicted of terrorism-related charges.",world
"A report on sexual abuse inside the Catholic Church in Germany says 3,677 people were abused by clergy between 1946 and 2014, two leading German media outlets said Wednesday.

Spiegel Online and Die Zeit said the report they obtained — commissioned by the German Bishops Conference and researched by three universities — concludes that more than half of the victims were 13 or younger and most were boys. Every sixth case involved rape and at least 1,670 clergy were involved, both weeklies reported. Die Zeit wrote that 969 abuse victims were altar boys.

The report also says that the actual number of victims was likely much higher, according to the research by experts from the Universities of Giessen, Heidelberg and Mannheim.

The German Bishops Conference said in a written response a few hours later that it regretted the leaking of the report, but that the study confirms “the extent of the sexual abuse” that took place.

“It is depressing and shameful for us,” Bishop Stephan Ackermann said. He didn’t further elaborate on the findings of the report, but said the Catholic group would present the study as initially planned on Sept. 25 together with the authors.

Die Zeit wrote that researchers weren’t allowed to look at the original church files but had to provide questionnaires to the dioceses, which then provided the information.

In their conclusions, the researchers write that there was evidence that some files were manipulated or destroyed, many cases were not brought to justice, and that sometimes abuse suspects — primarily priests — were simply moved to other dioceses without the congregations being informed about their past.

The Catholic Church has been struggling with sex abuse by its clergy for a long time.

In 2010, the German church was roiled by a sex abuse scandal triggered by the head of a Jesuit school in Berlin who went public about decades-long sexual abuse of high school students by clergy. Following that, a whole wave of victims who were sexually abused by clergy spoke out across the country.

An investigation in the United States last month found rampant sexual abuse of more than 1,000 children by about 300 Catholic priests in Pennsylvania.

Earlier this week, the Vatican said it is preparing the “necessary clarifications” about accusations that top Vatican officials including Pope Francis covered up the sexual misconduct of a now-disgraced American ex-cardinal.

Also on Wednesday, the Vatican said it’s summoning the presidents of every bishops’ conference around the world for a February summit to discuss preventing clergy sex abuse and protecting children.",world
"Residents of the Brazilian border town of Pacaraima attacked Venezuelan immigrants on Saturday after a local storeowner was robbed, stabbed and beaten in an assault blamed on four migrants, authorities said.

Pacaraima, in the northern jungle state of Roraima, is a major border crossing with Venezuela, where economic and political turmoil has driven tens of thousands to cross into Brazil over the past few years.

After a rally held to protest the attack against the storeowner, groups of residents roamed the town hurling rocks at the immigrants and setting fire to their belongings.

Police said the storeowner, who was beaten and robbed on Friday night, has been hospitalized and is in stable condition.

The Roraima state government estimates that more than 50,000 Venezuelan refugees have crossed the border occupying already existing shelters or sleeping in tents. The influx was nearly equal to 10 percent of the state's population of 520,000 inhabitants.

Police said that to escape the violence, hundreds of immigrants crossed the border back into Venezuela.

On a video posted by the G1 news portal a man's voice is heard shouting ""Get out. Get out. Go back to Venezuela.""

Wandenberg Ribeiro Costa, one of the organizers of Saturday's rally, told the G1 news portal ""we have expelled the Venezuelans.""

Claudio Lamachia, president of the Brazilian Bar Association, said in a statement that the violence that took place in Pacaraima ""exposed the humanitarian drama afflicting our neighbors ... who are trying to improve their lives and survive.""

""The state of Roraima does not have the conditions to shelter all the immigrants,"" he said, adding that close to 800 Venezuelans enter Roraima every day.

Milene de Souza, a volunteer at an evangelical church, told the Associated Press by phone that the situation is desperate.

""The world has to see what is happening here, where no one knows what to do,"" she said, adding that every day she helps Venezuelan engineers, doctors, lawyers and other professionals who sleep on the streets ""with their diplomas tucked under their pillows.""",world
"The U.S. Navy has identified the pilot who died Friday when the aircraft he was flying crashed at an Air Force base in New Mexico.

Navy Lt. Christopher Carey Short, of Canandaigua, N.Y., was piloting the A-29 Super Tucano jet when it crashed around 11:30 a.m. local time over the Red Rio Bombing Range, part of White Sands Missile Range, just 65 miles north of Holloman Air Force Base.

Short was participating in a training flight ""as a part of the Air Force’s Light Attack Experiment,” U.S. military officials said.

The Friday test was to determine whether the Air Force would select the Textron Aviation AT-6 Wolverine or the A-29 Super Tucano to make up its fleet of light attack aircrafts, Military.com reported.

""There's no way to describe the shock of this loss and the sadness we feel for his family,"" Air Force Col. Houston Cantwell, commander of Holloman's 49th Wing, said in a statement. ""He did pioneering work in aviation that will help shape American air power for years to come. We're thankful to have known him and grateful for his devotion to duty.""

""There's no way to describe the shock of this loss and the sadness we feel for his family. He did pioneering work in aviation that will help shape American air power for years to come. We're thankful to have known him and grateful for his devotion to duty."" - Air Force Col. Houston Cantwell, commander, 49th Wing, Holloman AFB, New Mexico

The White Sands Missile Range Directorate of Emergency Services was the first to respond to the scene.

Another crew member suffered minor injuries and was airlifted to a local hospital. That crew member's name and specific medical condition were not immediately available.

Friday’s crash was the seventh for the Air Force this year in a non-combat situation, matching the total for all of last year.

The crash also marked the second for an A-29 in a little over a year. Previously, an A-29 crashed near Moody Air Force base in Georgia. An Air Force report released in December blamed an engine problem and ""visibility restrictions from the rear cockpit.""

The A-29 test aircraft was owned and operated by a contractor, an Air Force spokesman told Fox News. Military.com reported the Super Tucano was made by Sierra Nevada/Emraer.

The cause of the crash remains under investigation.

Holloman AFB is about 217 miles south of Albuquerque.

Mexicans heading into Independence Day celebrations have been jolted by a brazen shooting that left four dead and nine wounded in Garibaldi Plaza, a famous square where mariachi musicians serenade tourists.

The Mexico City prosecutors' office said that at least one foreigner was among the wounded.

Mexican news outlet La Silla Rota circulated surveillance video of the alleged assailants dressed in the traditional mariachi garb of short embroidered jackets and pants, fleeing the scene on motorcycles.

The shooting cast a bloody pall over Independence Day festivities. Many Mexicans wear mariachi costumes Saturday evening to commemorate the launch of the revolt against Spanish rule on September 16, 1810.

Lisa Sanchez, director of Mexicans United Against Delinquency, described the shooting as a ""piercing portrait"" of Mexico.

She said the fact that the murder took place in a crowded public square demonstrates that impunity prevails in the country.

On Saturday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is set to shout ""Viva Mexico""_or ""Long Live Mexico""_shortly before midnight from a balcony of the National Palace. Thousands crowd into Mexico City's central Zocalo square every year to hear the shout, and the celebration usually spills into Garibaldi Plaza.

Videos circulating on social media showed musicians in the plaza continuing to play music during and after the shooting Friday night.

In one video, a man plucking a large harp continues to belt out the Mexican civil war anthem ""La Cucaracha"" as dozens of gunshots pierce the night.

In another, brass instruments and melancholic voices fill the air as the flashing lights of police vehicles descend on the plaza.",world

For the anxious Palestinian residents of Khan al-Ahmar, there's little left to do but wait.

After the West Bank hamlet lost its last legal protection against demolition late last week, Israeli forces could swoop in any day now to tear down the desert community's few dozen shacks and an Italian-funded schoolhouse made from recycled tires.

Some hold out hope that Israel might be deterred by an inevitable international outcry over razing the community. Major European countries have warned that flattening Khan al-Ahmar poses a grave threat to the already fading prospects of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The seemingly outsized international attention being paid to the tiny community is linked to its strategic location in the center of the West Bank. It's an area deemed essential for setting up a viable Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, areas Israel captured in 1967.

Israel has portrayed the battle over Khan al-Ahmar as a mere zoning dispute. Critics of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies say the village has become a symbol for what they describe as an ongoing displacement of Palestinians to make room for Israeli settlements.

With demolition now looming, dozens of activists, including foreigners, have been spending nights in Khan al-Ahmar to show support. They sleep on mattresses spread out under green tarp covering the front yard of the Italian-funded school.

""We cannot prevent demolition,"" said activist Mohammed Abu Hilweh, 30, from Jerusalem, as he stretched out on a mattress on a recent evening, settling in for the night.

""But we can resist, delay and when it happens, we can rebuild,"" he said.

Khan al-Ahmar is located a few dozen meters from a four-lane highway that runs east-west, effectively slicing the West Bank in half at a narrow waist and linking Jerusalem with the Jordan Valley.

The highway is also flanked by several Israeli settlements, including Maaleh Adumim, the West Bank's third largest. A new settlement across the highway from Maaleh Adumim, called E1 by Israeli planners, would effectively block the remaining land link between West Bank Palestinians and east Jerusalem, their hoped-for capital. Khan al-Ahmar sits just outside the area mapped for E1, which until now had largely been frozen under U.S. pressure.

Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, called the planned demolition a ""blatant attempt"" by Israel to separate the Palestinians from Jerusalem. ""It is absolutely imperative that the international community intervene,"" she said.

For the past 25 years, the international community has favored the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the best hope for peace. But those hopes are quickly fading.

In a departure from predecessors, President Donald Trump, who has promised a new peace plan, has refused to endorse the two-state solution while recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, over Palestinian opposition.

The U.S. State Department has said little about the looming demolition, referring reporters to the Israeli government for details.

By contrast, European governments have been outspoken.

""The demolition of this small Palestinian village would not only affect a local community,"" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini recently told the European Parliament. ""It would also be a blow against the viability of the state of Palestine and against the very possibility of a two-state solution.""

Separately, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom warned in a rare joint statement that demolition would have ""very serious"" consequences.

For now, Israel appears to be moving ahead. After a decade-long legal battle, Israel's Supreme Court rejected a final appeal earlier this month. Late last week, a moratorium on demolition expired.

Israel has not announced a date for the demolition, but earlier this week dismantled five corrugated metal shacks near Khan al-Ahmar that had been set up by villagers a few days earlier in a show of defiance. On Friday, troops returned with heavy equipment, removing earthen mounds set up to slow demolition. Two Palestinians and an American-French law professor were detained.

The 180 residents of Khan al-Ahmar are members of the Jahalin Bedouin tribe that has lived in the area since being expelled from the southern Negev Desert after Israel's establishment in 1948. The United Nations granted them refugee status.

Shani Sasson, a spokeswoman for COGAT, the Israeli defense body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, said Israel has offered to relocate the villagers.

She said the tribe squats on land that is not safe for living, and that the Israeli government has prepared an alternative site just a few kilometers (miles) away with sewage treatment and access to water and electricity. She said Israel has invested over $2 million in the relocation project.

""We are doing them a service,"" she said. ""This is not against them, this is for them.""

Residents acknowledge that life in their village is tough. But they say there is no place they would rather live. They say Israel is trying to move them to a site that will be too crowded for their livestock and that sits near a sewage facility and a garbage dump.

""We Bedouin people like the desert life,"" said Yousef Abu Dahouq, a Khan al-Ahmar resident, sitting on a wooden bench near the school, sipping tea and smoking a waterpipe. ""We live next to each other, support each other.""

The Palestinians and Europeans see a deeper Israeli agenda.

Khan al-Ahmar is in the 60 percent of the West Bank that is known as Area C and remains under full Israeli control, according to interim peace deals from the 1990s that are seemingly locked in place because of diplomatic paralysis. The remainder of the territory is administered by a Palestinian autonomy government.

Area C is home to about 400,000 Israeli settlers and an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 Palestinians. Israel places severe restrictions on Palestinian development while supporting and promoting dozens of settlements in the area.

The EU has attempted to build numerous structures for Palestinians in Area C, only to see them demolished or rejected because of a lack of hard-to-get permits. Khan al-Ahmar's Italian-funded school was built from car tires because a construction permit could not be obtained.

""This is the situation on the ground: New settlements for Israelis are built, while Palestinian homes in the same area are demolished,"" said Mogherini. ""This will only further entrench a one-state reality, with unequal rights for the two peoples, perpetual occupation and conflict.""

The village chief, Eid Khamis, promised to put up a fight.

""They want to kick us out and build settlements and we will not let that happen,"" he said. ""It's our land.""

Federman reported from Jerusalem.",world
"Nature expresses its fury in sundry ways. Two deadly storms — Hurricane Florence and Typhoon Mangkhut — roared ashore on the same day, half a world apart, but the way they spread devastation was as different as water and wind.

Storms in the western Pacific generally hit with much higher winds and the people who live in their way are often poorer and more vulnerable, Princeton University hurricane and climate scientist Gabriel Vecchi said Saturday. That will likely determine the type of destruction.

Mangkhut made landfall Friday on the northeastern tip of Luzon island in the Philippines with top-of-the-scale Category 5 winds of 165 mph. Florence had weakened to a Category 1 storm with 90 mph winds by the time it arrived at North Carolina's coast.

Yet a day after landfall the faster-moving Mangkhut was back out over open water — weakened, but headed across the South China Sea toward China. Florence, meanwhile, was still plodding across South Carolina at a pace slower than a normal person walks. By Saturday morning, it had already dumped more than 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain, a record for North Carolina.

Experts say Mangkhut may well end up being the deadlier storm. As of Saturday afternoon, the death count in the Philippines was a bit higher, although still far below that of other storms that have hit the disaster-prone island nation. And with Mangkhut now headed toward the densely populated southeast coast of China, it is likely to cause more death and destruction. But Florence's watery insured damage total will eventually be higher, Ernst Rauch, head of climate research for the world's largest reinsurer Munich Re, told German media.

That's because of a combination of geography, climatic conditions and human factors.

The western Pacific has two-and-a-half times more storms that reach the minimum hurricane strength of 74 mph. It has three-and-a-half times more storms that reach major hurricane strength of 111 mph, and three times more accumulated energy out of those hurricanes, an index that measures not just strength and number of storms but how long they last, according to more than 65 years of storm data .

So far this year there have been 23 named storms in the western Pacific and 10 in the Atlantic, both regions more than 30 percent busier than average years. Hurricanes and typhoons are the same type of storm; both are tropical cyclones, but those that occur in the Pacific west of the International Date Line are called typhoons.

The water in the western Pacific is warmer, and warm water fuels storms. There are also only a few pieces of land to get in the way and weaken them, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.

""If we are ever going to have a Category 6 (a speculated-on level that's above current measurement tools), the western Pacific is where it's going to be,"" said meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com.

The Philippines tends to get hit nearly every year, the Carolinas far less frequently though with lots of close calls, Maue said. That shows another big difference in the storms. Mangkhut formed further south and stayed south — over warmer water. Florence was out of the tropics when it hit land.

Because of that, Florence was weakened by the dry air and upper level winds of the higher latitudes. Not so the more southerly Mangkhut, which Maue said, ""essentially had a perfect environment to intensify to a Category 5 and stay there.""

""Mangkhut and Florence are certainly different animals,"" said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. Because Florence is moving so slowly, he said, it will dump more rain than Mangkhut, which is named for the Thai word for the mangosteen fruit.

Both storms have lasted a long time, especially Florence which formed all the way over near Africa 15 days before landfall, McNoldy said. Both storms cover a large area, but Mangkut still dwarfs Florence. Mangkhut's tropical storm force winds stretched more than 325 miles from the center, while Florence's spread about 195 miles, Klotzbach said.

Economics also play a role in a storm's impact. As a developing country, the Philippines is much poorer than the southeastern United States, which means houses tend to be less sturdy and first responders less well equipped, among other factors. This is one reason why, when disaster does strike, the effects can be devastating. In 2013, one of the most powerful storms on record, Typhoon Haiyan , killed 7,300 people and displaced more than 5 million when it swept across the islands of the central Philippines.

Straddling the famous Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is also bedeviled by volcanoes and earthquakes, and while there are considerable patches of poverty in North and South Carolina, it is not the same as the rural area where Mangkhut hit.

Munich Re's Rauch said about 30 to 50 percent of storm damage is usually insured in the United States but often less than 10 percent in developing countries, meaning nine-tenths of the people hit will end up shouldering a bigger economic burden.

In the United States, ""you can't move houses, but people can move out of the way,"" reflecting mounting damages from storms and often lower losses in life, Vecchi said.

As the world warms from the burning of fossil fuels, the globe will see both more extremely intense storms like Mangkhut and wetter storms like Florence, Vecchi said.

"The Dalai Lama said this week that “Europe belongs to the Europeans” and that refugees should eventually return to their native countries to rebuild them.

The Tibetan spiritual leader made the comment during a conference in Malmo, Sweden's third-largest city, known for its large immigrant population, Agence France-Presse reported.

""I think Europe belongs to the Europeans. ... “Receive them, help them, educate them … but ultimately they should develop their own country."" - The Dalai Lama

He noted that although Europe was “morally responsible” for helping those refugees fleeing danger in their home countries, the countries should let the immigrants know that “they ultimately should rebuild their own country” and go back.

“Receive them, help them, educate them … but ultimately they should develop their own country,” the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner added.

The Buddhist leader’s comments came just days after the populist party Sweden Democrats made significant strides in Sweden’s general election.

The party, which ran on a platform of opposing immigration, came in third, receiving nearly 18 percent of the vote, nearly 5 points up since the 2014 election. The small Nordic country reportedly took the most refugees per capita in 2015.

“Europe, for example Germany, cannot become an Arab country,” he said, according to the Washington Post reported. “Germany is Germany. There are so many that in practice it becomes difficult.”

"The United States has called an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council for Monday in response to what it says are efforts by some countries ""to undermine and obstruct"" sanctions against North Korea.

The U.S. Mission announced Friday evening that the meeting will ""discuss the implementation and enforcement of U.N. sanctions on North Korea.""

The mission didn't name any countries, but U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley accused Russia on Thursday of pressuring an independent panel of U.N. experts to alter a report on North Korea sanctions that included alleged violations ""implicating Russian actors.""

Haley said the panel should release the original report, which cited ""a massive increase in illicit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products"" for North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions. It said some products allegedly were off-loaded from Russian ships, which were identified in the report.

A summary of the experts report obtained in early August by The Associated Press also said North Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile programs. And it said North Korea is violating sanctions by transferring coal at sea and flouting an arms embargo and financial sanctions.

The Security Council initially imposed sanctions on North Korea after its first nuclear test in 2006 and has made them tougher and tougher in response to further nuclear tests and an increasingly sophisticated ballistic missile program.

Haley said earlier this year that successively tough Security Council sanctions resolutions adopted unanimously had cut off all North Korean exports, 90 percent of its trade, and disbanded its pool of workers send abroad to earn hard currency.

Many diplomats and analysts credit the sanctions with helping promote the thaw in relations between North Korea and South Korea as well as the June meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at which they agreed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

But in July, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused North Korea of ""illegally smuggling"" in refined petroleum products beyond the annual quota of 500,000 barrels allowed under U.N. sanctions.

U.S. documents sent to the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea and obtained by AP cited 89 instances between Jan. 1 and May 30 in which North Korean tankers likely delivered refined products ""illicitly procured"" via transfers from other ships at sea.

The U.S. said Russia and China both informed the sanctions committee that they were supplying refined products to North Korea. China, which is North Korea's closest ally, is responsible for more than 90 percent of the isolated country's trade.

Pompeo said North Korea is also evading sanctions by smuggling coal by sea and across borders, by using cyber thefts and other criminal activities, and by keeping workers in some countries that he didn't name.

All these activities are ""generating significant revenues for the regime and they must be stopped,"" he said.

At the time, Haley criticized ""some friends who want to go around the rules,"" and especially Russia and China for blocking the sanctions committee from demanding that all countries halt shipments of petroleum products to North Korea immediately.

After the experts' report was released in August, Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said he put a hold on its official release to all U.N. member nations ""because we disagree with certain elements"" that he refused to disclose.

Russia and China then blocked the U.N. from imposing sanctions on Russia-based entities and vessels sanctioned a week earlier by the U.S. Treasury Department.

The Russian news agency TASS quoted Russia's U.N. Mission as saying the proposed sanctions were ""unjustified.""

The Security Council has remained united in imposing tougher and tougher sanctions on North Korea, though the differences over the experts' report mark a serious dent in that unity.

U.N. diplomats familiar with discussions said Russia was angered that the panel used a lot of U.S. intelligence in the initial report that Moscow claimed was incorrect. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because talks were private.

Haley expressed disappointment in the panel ""for caving to Russian pressure and making changes to what should have been an independent report."" She called it ""a stain"" on the experts' important work.",world
