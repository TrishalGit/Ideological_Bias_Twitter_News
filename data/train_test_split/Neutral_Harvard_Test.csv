"WASHINGTON—Don McGahn, the top attorney in the White House, will leave his post in the coming months after the Senate vote on President Trump’s second Supreme Court nominee.

Mr. McGahn, the White House counsel, would be the latest among Mr. Trump’s senior aides to depart, and also the one most closely associated with the special counsel’s Russia investigation that has ensnared several of his former colleagues.

He will leave the White House in the fall, Mr. Trump announced in a Twitter post on Wednesday.

Mr. McGahn, who was also chief counsel for Mr. Trump’s campaign, had discussed his departure with the president earlier this year, but was surprised by the tweet, as were several other senior White House aides, including chief communications adviser Bill Shine, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Shine declined to comment on Mr. McGahn’s coming departure.

Mr. McGahn’s exit would coincide with the vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a process Mr. McGahn has overseen after shepherding the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch last year.

“Don McGahn’s a really good guy, been with me for a long time,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. “He’s done an excellent job.”

Mr. McGahn’s successor hasn’t been decided, White House officials said, but West Wing officials have long expected the role to be filled by Emmet Flood, a veteran Washington attorney who joined the administration in May.

Mr. McGahn, who pushed for Mr. Flood’s appointment to the White House legal team, has been helping groom Mr. Flood to take over, according to people familiar with the matter.

Some Trump allies are also pushing for Makan Delrahim, the assistant U.S. attorney general for the antitrust division of the Justice Department. Mr. Delrahim, who led the Trump administration’s effort to block AT&T Inc.’s acquisition of Time Warner Inc., is viewed as having more of a political background than Mr. Flood, said one person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Delrahim was staff director and chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee under Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), and he also wrote an opinion piece in the New York Post in 2016 urging Republicans to unite behind Mr. Trump in order to prevent Democrats from filling Supreme Court vacancies.

In the Trump White House, Mr. Flood has focused on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and any possible collusion between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Moscow. The probe has led to the recent conviction of Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and to a guilty plea by Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former White House national security adviser, among other cases. Mr. Trump and Russia have denied any wrongdoing.

Mr. McGahn cooperated extensively with Mr. Mueller’s investigation, sitting for 30 hours of interviews.

Mr. Trump has said he gave Mr. McGahn permission to do so. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he was unconcerned by Mr. McGahn’s cooperation: “We do everything straight, we do everything by the book,” he said.

Mr. Flood, a former partner at Williams & Connolly LLP known as a skilled criminal-defense attorney, is best known for his role representing former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings in the late 1990s.

Mr. Flood also served in the White House counsel’s office under former President George W. Bush, where he handled congressional investigations, including a review of the Bush administration’s controversial firings of seven U.S. attorneys.

Those who know Mr. Flood say he has brought a measured and moderate temperament to Mr. Trump’s legal team.

“People like him,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Wednesday. “He’s super well-respected around the building, but there’s not a plan locked in place at this point.”

News of Mr. McGahn’s departure drew concern from Capitol Hill, including from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who an aide said had no advance notice of the move.

“I hope it’s not true McGahn is leaving WhiteHouse Counsel,” Mr. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, wrote on Twitter. “U can’t let that happen.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Mr. McGahn’s “departure from the White House, whenever that may be, would be a big loss for the Trump administration and the country.”

Newsletter Sign-up

During his time at the White House, Mr. McGahn has overseen the successful confirmation of Justice Gorsuch and has been in charge of the recent nomination of Mr. Kavanaugh. He has also been focused on filling other judicial vacancies and staffing the Justice Department’s legal teams.

Mr. McGahn’s work on judicial appointments has “set an amazing stage” for his successor, said former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. “The president will miss him.”

Mr. McGahn has mused to friends about stepping down, and his battles with Mr. Trump over the Russia investigation and other legal matters, including the president’s initial plan to block immigration from several Muslim-majority countries, often left colleagues with the impression that he was preparing to quit. His plan to leave this fall was first reported by Axios.

Amid rumors of his departure, several of his top aides in the counsel’s office have announced their departures. Uttam Dhillon, a deputy White House counsel, was recently named head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. And Stefan Passantino, the counsel office’s chief ethics attorney, is leaving on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. McGahn’s pending departure leaves just a handful of senior aides in place who joined the Trump White House as top staffers on inauguration day in 2017.

Those include senior advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president’s daughter and son-in-law; Kellyanne Conway and Johnny DeStefano, both counselors to the president; senior adviser Stephen Miller; social media director Dan Scavino; and Deputy Chief of Staff Chris Liddell.

"WASHINGTON—Former colleagues honored Sen. John McCain as he lay in state at the U.S. Capitol on Friday, while members of the public lined up for a chance to pay their respects to the lawmaker.

Mr. McCain (R., Ariz.), a former Republican presidential nominee and war hero who died at age 81 on Saturday, became the 27th named individual to lie in state in the Capitol’s Rotunda room on the day before a memorial service at Washington National Cathedral. (Watch the video feed.)

Congress has also honored with a similar tribute unnamed soldiers from several wars and several private citizens, including civil-rights icon Rosa Parks and Rev. Billy Graham. The last lawmaker to have lain in state was Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii) in 2012.

Sen. John McCain's life will be remembered as one of service to his country. Hear him reflect on his years in the Navy, as a prisoner of war, six-term Senator and presidential nominee.

“Half a world away, wearing our nation’s uniform, John McCain stood up for every value that this Capitol Building represents. Then, he brought that same patriotism inside its walls,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said at Friday’s service, attended by dozens of lawmakers from both political parties. “So it is only right that today, near the end of his long journey, John lies here.”

Military officials carried Mr. McCain’s casket through pouring rain into the Capitol Friday morning, where it was scheduled to remain overnight. After Friday’s ceremony, Mr. McCain’s wife, Cindy, visited his desk in the Senate chamber, which had been draped with a black cloth all week, topped by a vase of white roses. And for hours afterwards, visitors lined up in the intense heat to wait for their chance to witness Mr. McCain’s final hours in the Capitol.

Mr. McCain’s death touched off a wellspring of tributes this week from lawmakers of both parties, who mourned the loss of a senator known for working across the aisle. Former Vice President Joe Biden spoke at his memorial service in Arizona on Thursday and former President Barack Obama, who defeated Mr. McCain in the 2008 presidential race, is expected to deliver remarks at the National Cathedral service on Saturday, as is former President George W. Bush.

Mr. McCain’s death also sparked his final tangle with President Donald Trump, who had criticized Mr. McCain for being captured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and raged against the senator after he voted against the GOP effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The president had resisted praising Mr. McCain for two days, before putting out a statement Monday.

In another controversy, the White House lowered the flag to half-staff on Saturday but then returned it to full-staff on Monday, drawing criticism from lawmakers and veterans groups who said it should remained at half-staff longer. The White House then reversed course and lowered it again, with Mr. Trump issuing a proclamation saying the flag would remain lowered until Sunday.

Vice President Mike Pence said Friday that Mr. Trump had asked him to speak at the ceremony honoring Mr. McCain.

“In my years in Congress and as vice president, we didn’t always agree,” Mr. Pence said. “But his support for limited government, for tax reform and support for our armed forces surely left our nation more prosperous and more secure and he will be missed.”

It was lowered to half-staff again Monday afternoon, shortly before Mr. Trump released his statement. The president’s proclamation covers the White House as well as all federal buildings, military bases and embassies.

White House officials said they prodded Mr. Trump for two days to put out a kind word about Mr. McCain. Mr. Trump resisted, and viewed the news coverage of the former senator’s death as over-the-top and more befitting a president, according to people familiar with the situation.

A service Saturday at Washington National Cathedral will include tributes from former Presidents George W.

Pallbearers will include former Vice President Joe Biden, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and actor Warren Beatty.

He said he has asked Mr. Kelly, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and national security adviser John Bolton to represent the administration at services for Mr. McCain.

Asked whether Mr. McCain or his family had asked Mr. Trump to not attend, McCain family spokesman Rick Davis didn’t answer directly, instead pointing to past media reports that had “by and large come to that conclusion” and saying he wouldn’t discuss further details. “The president will not be, as far as we know, attending the funeral. That’s just a fact,” Mr. Davis said.

The U.S. flag code calls for flags to be flown at half-staff on the day of death and the following day for a member of Congress, a protocol the White House has followed. But for many other prominent Americans, the flag has been lowered for several days and raised again only once the person is buried.

The White House’s decision to raise the flags prompted criticism from Democrats as well as several members of Mr. Trump’s own party.

“Shameful @POTUS only ordered White House flag at half-staff 4 short time,” tweeted Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida. “Attempts like this to diminish his legacy are pathetically petty.”

Veterans-advocacy groups also had pushed the White House to lower the flag for a longer period.

One of the first was Amvets, which demanded that flags be lowered either until Mr. McCain’s funeral or for one week. Joe Chenelly, the group’s national executive director, said Amvets was prepared to ask all U.S. governors to call for lowering flags in their states if the president wouldn’t act.

“Political backlash be damned on all this,” said Joe Chenelly, national executive director of Amvets. “It’s time to pay the proper respects to someone who helped lead this country in peacetime and war.,” Mr. Chenelly said.

The Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion asked Mr. Trump to keep American flags lowered until Mr. McCain’s interment.

In 2009, the White House ordered that its flags be flown at half-staff for Sen. Ted Kennedy until the day he was buried. And the White House flags were flown at half-staff until former first lady Barbara Bush’s burial this past April.

On Saturday, shortly after Mr. McCain’s passing was announced, Mr. Trump offered his condolences to the family in a short tweet that lacked any comments about Mr. McCain’s service to the nation. He ignored shouted questions about Mr. McCain from reporters at a White House event Monday.

The two have a long history. In 2015, Mr. Trump famously said that Mr. McCain wasn’t a war hero because his plane had been shot down and he was captured in Vietnam.

For his part, Mr. McCain yanked his endorsement of Mr. Trump in October 2016 after a videotape appeared showing the former reality-TV star talking of sexually aggressive behavior toward women.

Mr. McCain also cast a deciding vote against the president’s health-care overhaul in July 2017, drawing regular jabs from Mr. Trump even after he left the Senate and returned home to Arizona due to his illness.

"PERRY MILLS, N.Y.—A small group of people from Nigeria and Mali stepped off a shuttle bus here on a recent evening and lugged suitcases and backpacks along a country road toward the border with Canada. A Canadian police officer was waiting there to arrest them.

The group is part of a fresh wave of asylum seekers flooding into Canada in recent weeks, undeterred by the threat of arrest and posing the latest test for Canada’s immigration-friendly stance.

Roughly 2,600 people used unofficial border crossings like this one to enter the country in April, according to Canadian police data. That marked the latest surge following the crossing last summer of some 8,500 asylum seekers.

People breaching the border is a new challenge for Canada. The country’s geographic isolation has traditionally allowed it to maintain a highly selective immigration and refugee system, as migrants from Africa and the Middle East have poured into Europe in recent years and the U.S. has grappled with illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America.

“It forces Canadians, who have always patted themselves on the back for being very open to immigration, very welcoming, to deal with the kinds of challenges Italy, Greece and others have been facing and to realize it’s not so easy,” said Irene Bloemraad, a migration expert and the chair of Canadian studies at University of California, Berkeley.

Canada’s Liberal government has faced heated criticism over its handling of the influx. The opposition Conservatives want the government to shut down unofficial border crossings, saying the asylum seekers using them are sapping resources normally devoted to processing applicants from other immigration and refugee streams. The Immigration and Refugee Board, which decides on asylum claims, has a backlog of 53,000 cases, and the labor union representing Canada’s border officers has said that staffing is insufficient to deal with the added pressure of asylum seekers.

“They risk turning Canadian support away from our once compassionate and orderly immigration system,” Conservative lawmaker Michelle Rempel said in a press conference last week.

The province of Quebec complained publicly last month that it wasn’t receiving enough support from the federal government to deal with the new spike in asylum seekers. In response, officials have promised to come up with a plan for moving more asylum seekers into English-speaking provinces.

Last year, facing the arrival of thousands of Haitians who feared losing their temporary protected status in the U.S., Canadian officials began a campaign to dissuade them from turning up at the border and seeking asylum. The effort included targeted advertising and visits to Haitian and Central American communities to dispel rumors that Canada granted automatic residency.

For a while, the efforts appeared to be working, and asylum claims at the border fell sharply. But those earlier arrivals have been replaced by others, mostly from Nigeria, officials said, illustrating the challenge Canadian officials face in identifying and preventing the next big influx.

Officials say the Nigerians have been turning up at the Canadian border after obtaining visas that allow them to travel to the U.S.

Last week, Canada Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said the U.S. and Canada are studying a 14-year-old treaty called the Safe Third Country Agreement that requires asylum seekers to make their claims in whichever country they arrive first.

There is an exception if they enter Canada illegally, making routes like the one used from upstate New York into Quebec popular because it allows asylum seekers to get around the deal. Canada says it isn’t practical to apply the agreement to the entire border, in part because much of the border isn’t staffed by guards.

Unless police believe they represent a threat to Canada, asylum seekers are released after their arrest and don’t face criminal charges.

The response in Canada to the wave of asylum seekers has been mixed. A Quebec-based organization called Bridges Not Borders has sent delegations to the border to greet incoming migrants and is lobbying Canadian officials to allow asylum seekers to use official points of entry. But last year, the arrival of thousands of Haitians in the French-speaking province triggered several anti-immigration rallies. Another Quebec group is planning a protest at the border with New York state later this month. The group wants asylum seekers turned back if they approach at unofficial crossings.

Mr. Hussen and other officials are concerned shutting down unofficial crossings would push migrants to use more dangerous routes and sneak into the country undetected. Instead, they are trying head off a big wave of claimants ahead of summer. The minister met with Nigeria’s high commissioner to Canada last month to discuss the rise in the number of Nigerians using U.S. visas to enter Canada and then claim asylum. His department has also sent officers to Nigeria to communicate with U.S. embassy officials about abuse of travel visas; Mr. Hussen is in Nigeria this week. The Canadian government also aims to send officials to Nigerian churches in the U.S. to dispel myths of easy entry to Canada.

In the course of seven hours on a recent Wednesday, 25 people made the trek at an unofficial border crossing between New York state and the Canadian province of Quebec. Groups arrived by taxi or shuttle bus to Roxham Road, a quiet route that dead-ends at a small ditch marking the local border between Canada and the U.S.

They included people from Nigeria, Lebanon, Haiti, Sri Lanka, Mali and Ivory Coast who headed directly toward the Canadian police officers stationed on the other side of the stream, walking past signs warning that crossing the border here is illegal and claiming asylum “is not a free ticket into Canada.”

One woman said she and her family had taken a plane from Nigeria to New York City, then a bus to Plattsburgh, N.Y., and a shuttle to the Canadian border.

“We came here for protection, for a better life,” she said, adding that her family faced persecution and worries over female genital mutilation in Nigeria. She declined to give her name as she hurried across.

Janet McFetridge, an American woman who lives about 5 miles from the Roxham Road border crossing, has visited the border almost daily over the past year to hand out hats, mittens, coats and coloring books for children. During that time, she has collected a large envelope of personal items that people have discarded on their way to the border. The envelope includes a Nigerian identity card and airline tickets showing travel from several different U.S. cities.

Once arrested for crossing the border at an unofficial entry point, asylum seekers are sent by shuttle bus to shelters in Montreal. Asylum seekers can ultimately be deported if their claims are unsuccessful.

Audrey Macklin, an expert in migration law at University of Toronto, said Canada needs to ensure adequate resources to settle new arrivals and handle their claims.

“Canadians certainly are very proud of their recent record of resettling Syrian refugees,” she said. “I think that their views about people who make asylum claims [at the border] are more volatile.”

"CARACAS, Venezuela—The exodus of Venezuelans gained pace as the government’s plans to address the collapsing economy fueled anxiety, while tensions grew in neighboring countries that have strained to absorb refugees.

Over the weekend, Venezuela’s battered business sector warned that President Nicolás Maduro’s plans—including a leap in the minimum wage, new taxes and a currency devaluation—would paralyze the economy and drive more people out. About 2.3 million have fled since 2014, according to United Nations estimates.

Meanwhile, a mob burned a refugee camp in Brazil on Saturday in retaliation for a robbery purportedly committed by four Venezuelans, prompting that country’s president, Michel Temer, to order 120 troops to the troubled border. In Ecuador, the government on Saturday began requiring Venezuelans to have a passport, which are nearly impossible to obtain. Peru said it would follow suit after police arrested five Venezuelan men accused of planning a bank robbery.

Colombia, which has taken in about one million Venezuelans, is awaiting the arrival of a U.S. Navy hospital ship, the Comfort, to provide Venezuelans medical treatment.

For many who remain, it seems as if Venezuela is splitting at the seams. Rolling blackouts have crimped oil output, energy consultants said. Heavy rains, meanwhile, have devastated the south and west near Colombia, leaving some villages under water and residents pleading with government officials for help.

Venezuela’s opposition, its leaders at odds over how to deal with the crisis, joined with representatives of some oil workers’ unions to call for a national strike on Tuesday, the day Mr. Maduro’s economic measures are to take effect.

“Tuesday’s call is the first step to unify the people in the struggle,” Andres Velasquez, a prominent opposition politician, said on Sunday. “Maduro’s measures are not meant to improve the economy but instead represent more hunger and poverty.”

Another opposition politician, Maria Corina Machado, said in an interview that Venezuelans and regional governments needed to step up the pressure on Mr. Maduro. If nothing is done, she said of the government: “They can annihilate us and impose their mafia state.”

Still, Mr. Maduro has weathered protests in his tumultuous five years in power, cracking down on demonstrators with such fury that few now dare to protest.

The president’s new measures include a new currency called the sovereign bolivar, which will lop five zeros off the existing tender. Many economists said the move fails to address the real cause of inflation: uncontrolled printing of money.

The rollout comes as Mr. Maduro plans to raise the minimum wage to about $30 a month from less than $1.

Economists warn the measures will drive inflation even higher than the 1,000,000% the International Monetary Fund projects this year. The government, which is in default on $6 billion in debt, is expected to print more bank notes to make up for a loss of export earnings that has come with the drop in oil production.

The president has also pledged to raise the price of subsidized gasoline, which in the past has sparked riots. The plan is for subsidies to be maintained with the national identification Fatherland Card, which critics said is used for social control. Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said new gasoline prices wouldn’t be announced before late September.

For ordinary people, Mr. Maduro’s measures mean more anguish and uncertainty.

Those trying to stick it out here said Mr. Maduro’s proposals would destroy what was left of the economy. Those Venezuelans considering fleeing worried about the growing backlash against hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who have already left.

Maria Planchart once lived comfortably in Caracas and had aspirations of being a lawyer. In this WSJ Films documentary, we follow her struggle to feed her family.

“Everything is chaos,” said Nelly Baric, an employee at a public hospital who once supported the so-called revolutionary government that, upon taking power 19 years ago, promised to upend the old economic and social order. “I’m afraid they will close more small businesses and, if you consider the [low] production today, which is very insufficient, then you can imagine the situation we’re in.”

Randú Carvajal plans to close his Caracas restaurant and hasn’t ruled out migrating. “We don’t know what to do. All the prices are going to go up.”

Mr. Maduro on Friday night asked Venezuelans to trust his economic measures.

A former bus driver and union activist, Mr. Maduro trained in Communist Cuba as a young man but never received an education in economics; his primary economic adviser has been Alfredo Serrano, a Spanish leftist who adheres to the theory that the U.S., angry about a socialist government in its hemisphere, is orchestrating the disaster that has befallen this country of 30 million.

“Let’s have faith,” Mr. Maduro said as he unveiled details of his plan. “Rest assured that sooner or later, we, in economic matters, will be harvesting victories.…I trust in you and I ask for your support.”

In Caracas, large parts of the capital don’t have running water, and some wealthy residential complexes are drilling their own wells.

On Sunday, Caracas and many other cities were like ghost towns. Stores that normally open were mostly closed, their owners afraid they would be swamped by panicked shoppers. Gas stations, in contrast, did a brisk business as people rushed to fill their tanks, fearing a price increase. Some stores selling perishables, like meat, opened with hopes of unloading their stock.

José Ramón Pérez, a vegetable dealer, was open but said suppliers hadn’t sent produce. “There are almost no goods, look at the empty stalls,” he said, adding that some were hoarding, awaiting the new currency and new prices.

María de Figueira, who also sells produce, predicted chaos as Mr. Maduro’s new measures are felt. “We’ll probably be insulted by clients who are as confused as I am,” she said. “When something costs 3.4 million bolivars and I tell people it’s now 34 bolivars they’ll look at me and say they cost three or four.”

The outflow of people from what was once Latin America’s richest nation has exacerbated tensions in neighboring countries, particularly with poorer classes who have had to compete with Venezuelans desperate for any kind of job.

In Brazil on Sunday, Mr. Temer held an emergency cabinet meeting a day after a mob of Brazilians upset by news reports that four Venezuelans had beaten up a storekeeper during a robbery burned a refugee shelter. The Brazilians chased some desperate Venezuelans back across the border.

“They burned everything. Brazilians took it all, our bags, everything,” an unidentified Venezuelan woman told Brazil’s GloboTV. Scores of Brazilians sang the national anthem while police escorted refugees out of Paracaima, a town located on the border with Venezuela.

One Brazilian in a video said war had been declared with the robbery by the Venezuelans. “God only knows what may happen,” he said.

The news from abroad made Luis Lorenzo, 34 years old, who is considering leaving, think twice. “I feel fear to be rejected upon arrival,” he said, “and that will make finding a job harder.”

"Michael Cohen had many reasons to play ball last weekend when his legal team sat down to talk to federal prosecutors.

The Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office had testimony from Mr. Cohen’s accountant and business partners, along with bank records, tax filings and loan applications that implicated not only Mr. Cohen in potential criminal activity, but also his wife, who filed taxes jointly with her husband. Prosecutors signaled Mr. Cohen would face nearly 20 criminal counts, potentially carrying a lengthy prison sentence and staggering financial penalties.

Adding to the pressure, David Pecker, the chairman of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, provided prosecutors with details about payments Mr. Cohen arranged with women who alleged sexual encounters with President Trump, including Mr. Trump’s knowledge of the deals.

This account of how Mr. Cohen went from a pugnacious defender of the president to turning on Mr. Trump is based on details provided by people close to Mr. Cohen and others briefed on the discussions with prosecutors.

For weeks, the president had been distancing himself from Mr. Cohen, including by stopping paying his longtime attorney’s legal fees, making clear amid the pressure that he was on his own.

Under oath on Tuesday, before a packed courtroom, Mr. Cohen created a spectacular moment without parallel in American history when he confessed to two crimes that he said he committed at the behest of the man who would become president.

Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes, including tax evasion and making false statements to a bank, capping a monthslong investigation into his business dealings and work as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer. For the president, it opens up a perilous new legal front.

Mr. Cohen in court said Mr. Trump directed him to arrange payments during the 2016 campaign to two women who alleged they had sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. The payments violated caps on campaign contributions and a ban on corporate contributions, prosecutors said.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump denied he directed Mr. Cohen to buy the women’s silence. Contradicting earlier statements, the president said he became aware of the payments to the women “later on” and said Mr. Cohen was reimbursed from his personal funds, not his 2016 campaign coffers.

The investigation is continuing, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Although the plea deal doesn’t require Mr. Cohen’s cooperation, it leaves the door open for him to talk with both the Southern District of New York and special counsel Robert Mueller. The court restricted Mr. Cohen’s travel to New York City; Chicago, where he owns taxi medallions; South Florida, where his parents live; and Washington, D.C., where the special counsel is based.

The deal doesn’t preclude further prosecutions, including other charges against Mr. Cohen.

Prosecutors built their case partly by using materials seized in April 9 raids of Mr. Cohen’s home, office and hotel, including recordings and other items that provided evidence of campaign-finance violations.

Investigators quickly zeroed in on Mr. Cohen’s relationship with American Media, including its role brokering deals on behalf of Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker had been an open supporter of Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Prosecutors say Mr. Pecker offered to help keep quiet negative stories about Mr. Trump that might come to the National Enquirer, a practice in the business known as “catch and kill.”

American Media executives were involved in both hush-money deals that formed the basis of Mr. Cohen’s guilty plea to campaign-finance violations, prosecutors said on Tuesday. One was a $130,000 payment to Stephanie Clifford—a former porn star who goes professionally by Stormy Daniels—as part of an agreement to keep her from publicly discussing an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. The payment was first reported by The Wall Street Journal in January.

The second was a $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her exclusive story of an alleged extramarital affair with Mr. Trump, a story that was purchased by American Media in August 2016 at Mr. Cohen’s urging, and then never published. The payment was first reported by the Journal in November 2016.

On April 5, days before the raids, Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One he didn’t know about the payment to Ms. Clifford, and referred questions about the matter to Mr. Cohen. “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen,” Mr. Trump said. “Michael is my attorney.”

Mr. Cohen, who that night was staying aboard the yacht of Trump donor Franklin Haney, which was docked in Miami, grew irate on the ship soon after Mr. Trump made his remarks distancing himself from the Clifford payment, according to a person familiar with the episode. Mr. Cohen was swearing loudly as others on the boat were sipping their drinks, the person said.

The search warrant executed on April 9 sought materials and information related to a wide range of communications, including ones related to the payments to Ms. Clifford and Ms. McDougal. At the same time, investigators subpoenaed Mr. Pecker, American Media and the Trump Organization, Mr. Trump’s business.

Prosecutors had reason to be concerned that without raiding Mr. Cohen’s office, “records could have been deleted without record and without recourse for law enforcement,” according to a court filing.

Prosecutors in the Southern District said the investigation into Mr. Cohen was, in part, a referral from the special counsel’s office. It isn’t clear when the referral took place, or if the office was already investigating Mr. Cohen when the referral came through.

The special counsel’s office was examining Mr. Cohen’s finances since at least October 2017, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Prior to the raids, investigators had already obtained covert search warrants on multiple email accounts used by Mr. Cohen, prosecutors said in a court filing. Early this year, they also had subpoenaed Mr. Cohen’s former accountant, Jeffrey A. Getzel, who handled Mr. Cohen’s personal and business tax returns.

In May, Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for Ms. Clifford, released a memo detailing payments made to Mr. Cohen from companies including AT&T Inc. and Novartis AG , as well as an investment firm linked to a Russian oligarch. Federal agents investigated whether Mr. Cohen lobbied Trump administration officials on the companies’ behalf without registering as a lobbyist, the Journal previously reported.

Initially, Mr. Cohen seemed unlikely to turn on the president. Although their relationship was at times turbulent, Mr. Trump appreciated Mr. Cohen’s absolute loyalty. On the day of the raids, Mr. Trump called the move a “disgrace” and a “witch hunt.”

Soon after the April raids, Mr. Cohen’s relationship with Mr. Trump began to deteriorate.

The estrangement began over legal bills, said a person who has spoken with Mr. Cohen about the matter. The Trump family covered part of Mr. Cohen’s legal fees after the raids, but then stopped paying.

Mr. Cohen felt exposed. Public comments by Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, put distance between the president and Mr. Cohen and further alienated the attorney, the person said.

Mr. Cohen told associates and friends he felt Mr. Trump didn’t have his back and vented that the president hadn’t personally offered to pay his legal bills in the Manhattan investigation, which he said were “bankrupting” him.

Mr. Cohen’s troubles increased in May, when Evgeny “Gene” Freidman, a New York City taxi mogul who managed taxi medallions owned by Mr. Cohen and his relatives, pleaded guilty to state criminal tax fraud and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in their probe of Mr. Cohen.

By then, prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service had focused on Mr. Cohen’s personal income taxes. In conversations with a potential witness in June and July, investigators asked “very pointed” questions about various tax filings, according to a person familiar with the conversations.

“They knew what they wanted, they knew what they had, and they went after it,” the person said.

In late June, Mr. Cohen openly broke with Mr. Trump.

A personal turning point for Mr. Cohen was a conversation with his father, Maurice Cohen, a Holocaust survivor.

Mr. Cohen’s father urged him not to protect the president, saying he didn’t survive the Holocaust to have his name sullied by Mr. Trump, according to a person who was told about the conversation. The elder Mr. Cohen couldn’t be reached for comment.

On June 20, Mr. Cohen stepped down from his position as the Republican National Committee’s deputy finance chairman and tweeted his first public criticism of his former boss: “As the son of a Polish holocaust survivor, the images and sounds of this family separation policy [are] heart wrenching.” The tweet no longer appears on Mr. Cohen’s Twitter account.

By then, Mr. Cohen had hired New York lawyer Guy Petrillo to represent him in the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s probe. The choice of Mr. Petrillo, who had once served as the chief of the office’s criminal division, was seen as a sign that Mr. Cohen hoped to cooperate. Mr. Petrillo began to signal this intent to prosecutors.

Shortly after Mr. Petrillo’s hiring, Mr. Cohen told ABC News in an interview that his first loyalty was to his family and country, not to the president.

In July, a recording became public that Mr. Cohen surreptitiously made of a conversation he had with Mr. Trump in September 2016 about buying the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story. The president has denied the affair.

The president’s legal team had waived attorney-client privilege on the recording, which had been seized in the April 9 raids.

The week of the recording’s release, the investigation appeared to accelerate, people familiar with the investigation said.

Federal prosecutors faced an early September deadline to charge Mr. Cohen. After that, they would have to wait until after the midterm elections, under Department of Justice guidelines, or risk criticism of potentially affecting the election’s outcome. They had follow-up witness interviews scheduled as recently as this week, a person familiar with the investigation said, but canceled them as the plea agreement came together over the weekend.

Given the Justice Department’s policy of not indicting sitting presidents, a guilty plea from Mr. Cohen and his public implication of Mr. Trump were among the strongest outcomes prosecutors could have hoped for, according to former federal prosecutors. For prosecutors, the guilty plea meant they could avoid a contentious trial and free up resources to pursue other investigations.

On Monday, Manhattan federal prosecutors filed a court document, in a case then labeled as U.S. v. John Doe, indicating a guilty plea was forthcoming.

By Tuesday night, hours after Mr. Cohen implicated Mr. Trump in a possible crime, one of Mr. Cohen’s lawyers, Lanny Davis, appeared on cable news shows to say Mr. Cohen wouldn’t accept a pardon from Mr. Trump and “is more than happy to tell the special counsel all that he knows.”

"China’s first-ever landing of a heavy bomber on a disputed island in the South China Sea punctuates a steady buildup of military assets that has solidified Beijing’s claims to one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.

On Friday, China’s air force disclosed it had landed an H-6K bomber on an island in the area, which would “help improve actual combat capabilities in responding to various security threats at sea.”

Experts who track China’s military moves said the landing was on Woody Island in the Paracels, an island chain where claims by Vietnam, China and Taiwan intersect.

The landing was the latest in a series of military moves that China has carried out while global attention has been focused on the standoff with North Korea. Earlier this month, China deployed antiship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles on the disputed Spratly Islands off the coast of the Philippines for the first time.

Satellite imagery also shows Beijing has installed radars and communication-jamming equipment on the Paracels and Spratlys in recent months, and that Chinese navy ships and military aircraft have made frequent visits.

Together, the deployments give China an interconnected array of radar, missile batteries and airfields that will allow it to project power over hundreds of miles of ocean where the U.S. Navy’s dominance previously faced few serious challenges. “They crossed a big threshold,” said Euan Graham, director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute.

The militarization of the South China Sea is part of a broader push by President Xi Jinping to assert control over long-claimed territory and extend China’s defensive perimeter further into the Pacific, moves that are popular at home. As much as a third of global trade passes annually through the 1.35 million square miles of ocean, which is also thought to be rich in natural resources including oil and natural gas. China says it has historical claims to almost the entire area and that it has the right to defend those claims.

China staged its biggest military show of force in the South China Sea last month when it deployed dozens of navy vessels, including an aircraft carrier and nuclear-missile submarines, off its southern Hainan island.

The White House said this month that it has raised concerns with Beijing about the militarization of the South China Sea and warned there would be consequences. The new commander of U.S. Pacific naval forces, Adm. Philip Davidson, told a Senate committee in April that China had nearly completed military bases on its reclaimed South China Sea islands. “China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States,” he said.

"WASHINGTON—President Trump canceled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s scheduled weekend trip to North Korea in a series of tweets Friday after a briefing, signaling for the first time frustration with deadlocked nuclear talks.

“I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea, at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula…” Mr. Trump said on Twitter.

Mr. Trump’s decision appeared to take State Department officials by surprise. Mr. Pompeo named a new special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, to lead the talks only a day earlier, and staffers were preparing for the trip to go ahead on Sunday as planned.

Mr. Pompeo was in a meeting with Mr. Trump in the White House when the president wrote the tweets calling off the meeting, a person familiar with the matter said. The president made the decision after talking to Mr. Pompeo and getting an update on the state of negotiations, which have been gridlocked since Mr. Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June.

“I’m not satisfied with the progress,” Mr. Trump said at the meeting with his top diplomat, the person familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Trump appeared to blame China for the lack of progress on the negotiations, even though Beijing doesn’t have a direct role in the process. Officials say progress has stalled because the U.S. wants North Korea to take concrete steps before making any concessions, while Pyongyang wants Washington to reciprocate as it moves toward denuclearization.

Mr. Trump suggested in one tweet that China was no longer cooperating on denuclearization as a way to punish the U.S. over tariffs that have triggered a tit-for-tat trade dispute between the two countries. He said Mr. Pompeo would travel to North Korea after the trade dispute is resolved.

“Because of our much tougher Trading stance with China, I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were,” Mr. Trump wrote.

The U.S. has been calling on China to strictly enforce wide-ranging United Nations sanctions targeting North Korea’s economy. The sanctions were designed to exert painful economic pressure on Pyongyang and drive North Korea’s Mr. Kim to enter into talks over the country’s nuclear program.

Beijing initially appeared to work closely with the U.S. to enforce the U.N. sanctions, but in recent weeks U.S. officials have protested, citing a reported increase in trade between China and North Korea, and they warned that it could ease pressure on Pyongyang to negotiate.

Trade talks between the U.S. and China ended on Thursday without any sign of progress toward a solution. The U.S. put in place tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese goods on Thursday, raising the total to $50 billion. The Chinese have matched them dollar for dollar. The U.S. is eyeing tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese imports, about half the total from China, that could start taking effect as early as September.

China’s Foreign Ministry issued a stern riposte to Mr. Trump’s remarks, saying Beijing has consistently worked toward denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and maintaining regional stability.

“The U.S. statement is contrary to the basic facts and irresponsible. We are gravely concerned,” ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a Saturday statement. All relevant countries should “show more sincerity and flexibility, instead of acting capriciously and blaming others.”

Mr. Pompeo and his newly appointed special representative to North Korea, Mr. Biegun, were due to leave for Pyongyang on Sunday and then travel to Beijing.

It wasn’t immediately clear why Mr. Trump linked China’s lack of help on sanctions to the decision to cancel the talks with North Korea. Administration officials have often said that economic issues related to China and North Korea are kept on separate tracks, even though Mr. Trump sometimes treats them as related.

The purpose of the trip was to introduce Mr. Beigun, who will be taking over responsibility for the talks, and to push Pyongyang to do more to show commitment to its promise to move toward giving up its nuclear weapons.

Mr. Trump has long insisted the talks with North Korea were progressing well, and Friday’s tweets were the first indication that progress was going slower than expected.

As recently as last month, Mr. Trump tweeted that the U.S. was having “many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well!”

South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, in a telephone call with Mr. Pompeo on Saturday, expressed regret over Mr. Pompeo’s delayed visit to North Korea and said all sides should “maintain momentum” of the talks and work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establishing peace, according to a press release from Seoul’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Mr. Pompeo has made several trips to Pyongyang, but talks have been gridlocked over opposing demands. The U.S. wants North Korea to front-load its promises to denuclearize and take concrete steps to dismantle its assets before offering any concessions. North Korea wants the U.S. to make reciprocal, step-by-step concessions as a show of good faith.

Mr. Biegun was appointed to take over the nuclear talks on Thursday, after Mr. Pompeo’s relationship with the North Koreans appeared to sour. North Korea’s foreign ministry described Mr. Pompeo’s approach as “gangster-like” after a visit in July, and avoided a bilateral meeting with the secretary during a regional meeting earlier this month.

Despite the lack of progress at the lower level, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have continued to send each other friendly signals. On Friday, Mr. Trump repeated a previous promise to see Mr. Kim again. The two leaders met at a summit in Singapore in June.

“In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim. I look forward to seeing him soon!,” Mr. Trump said in another Tweet Friday.

The State Department didn’t immediately comment.

"London

Other tourists may remember London for its spectacular sights and history, but I remember it for Islam. When I was visiting the U.K. as a teenager in 2006, I got lost in an East London market. There I saw a group of women wearing head-to-toe black cloaks. I froze, confused and intimidated by the faceless figures. It was my first encounter with the niqab, which covers everything but a woman’s eyes.

This summer, I found myself heading back to the U.K. as it was plunging into a debate over Islamic dress. Boris Johnson, the country’s former foreign secretary and London’s ex-mayor, wrote a column opposing attempts to ban face-covering veils. Nonetheless, he added, “it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes.” The responses could hardly have been more heated.

I wanted to cut past the polemics and experience London’s Muslim communities for myself. My first visit was to Tower Hamlets, an East London borough that is about 38% Muslim, among the highest in the U.K. As I walked down Whitechapel Road, the adhan, or call to prayer, echoed through the neighborhood. Muslims walked in one direction for jumu’ah, Friday prayer, while non-Muslims went the opposite way. Each group kept its distance and avoided eye contact with the other.

Women and girls were dressed in hijabs, niqabs and abayas (robes). Some of the males wore skullcaps and thawbs, Arabic tunics, with their trousers tailored just above the ankles as per Muhammad’s example. The scene could have been lifted out of Riyadh, a testament to the Arabization of Britain’s South Asian Muslims. At the barbershop, women waited outside under the hot sun while their sons and husbands were groomed.

Inside the East London Mosque, visitors were expected to dress “modestly.” Headscarves were provided at reception for any woman who showed up without one. A kind man on staff showed me around the men’s quarters. He gave me a bag filled with booklets about Islam. In one, Muslims are encouraged to “re-establish the Shari’ah,” or Islamic law. Those who ignore this mandate are “of little worth to any society.”

That night, I visited the Houses of Parliament. Rifle-carrying police officers greeted me when I stepped out of the Tube. The extra security was mobilized in response to last year’s car and stabbing attack in Westminster by Khalid Masood, who killed five people. Outside the station, there are roadblocks along Westminster Bridge and a new security fence in front of the palace yard. I asked an officer about Masood’s attack. “I’d rather not talk about it,” he replied. “I was there that day.”

Forty-eight hours later, I woke up to the news that a car had rammed a Westminster security barrier. Police arrested Salih Khater, a 29-year-old Sudanese refugee who had been given asylum and British citizenship. Three people were injured in the attack. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, expressed support for banning vehicles from parts of Parliament Square.

Next I visited Leyton, another district in East London where some Muslim social norms prevail. An Arab cafe near the Tube station was filled with men; no women were inside. An Islamic bookstore sold hijab-wearing dolls for children. The dolls had blank, featureless faces, since human depictions are prohibited in conservative Islam.

I stopped outside the Masjid al-Tawhid, a South Asian Salafi mosque and madrassa (school), just before afternoon prayer time. A group of girls in robes and veils walked around back, toward the dumpsters, where the women’s entrance is located. I later saw the Islamic Shari’a Council of Leyton. This community has religious, educational, business and legal institutions to maintain a separate identity.

All this gave me pause. But I was unprepared for what I would see next in Luton, a small town 30 miles north of London and the birthplace of the English Defense League, which has held unruly anti-Muslim demonstrations. At the Central Mosque, I met a friendly group of Punjabi-speaking young men. “You’ve come to see Luton?” one struggled to ask me in English. The young men asked me to follow them through the town center.

Within minutes, we walked by three other mosques, which were vibrant and filled with young men coming and going. We passed a church, which was closed and decrepit, with a window that had been vandalized with eggs. We squeezed by hundreds of residents busy preparing for the Eid al-Adha holiday. Girls in hijabs gathered around tables to paint henna designs on their hands. All the businesses had a religious flair: The eateries were halal, the fitness center was sex-segregated, and the boutiques displayed “modest” outfits on mannequins. Pakistani flags flew high and proud. I never saw a Union Jack.

The men finally led me to a discreet building that housed a small Islamic center. They spoke privately to its imam. I was led upstairs to see him. The imam asked me if I was prepared to convert. Apparently there had been some miscommunication with the young men. I told the imam I wasn’t ready for that, but I would appreciate any literature I could take home. He led me to a bookshelf and said I could have whatever I wanted. I grabbed the first booklet that was in English. It was by Zakir Naik, a fundamentalist preacher from India. “The Qur’an says that Hijab has been prescribed for the women,” the booklet explained in one section, “so that they are recognised as modest women and this will also prevent them from being molested.”

Other tourists might remember London for Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus and Big Ben. I’ll remember it for its failed multiculturalism. Or perhaps this is what successful multiculturalism looks like.

"The U.S. and Mexico are getting close to reaching a bilateral agreement on key issues holding back a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, removing a hurdle to completing a deal that would eventually include Canada, according to people closely tracking the negotiations.

Trump administration officials and their Mexican counterparts are debating a proposal to exempt some industries from dispute-settlement provisions, which would remove one of the most difficult issues, the people said.

The negotiations have also included discussions over how much local content a car should have, and the cost of labor to produce a car, to qualify for tariff-free treatment under Nafta. The auto-related discussions are at an “advanced” stage, said one official familiar with the matter.

“Our relationship with Mexico is getting closer by the hour,” tweeted President Trump on Saturday morning, as negotiators continued their work. “A big Trade Agreement with Mexico could be happening soon!”

One of the sticking points throughout the last year of Nafta negotiations between the U.S., Mexico and Canada has been Washington’s desire to weaken or remove a provision in Nafta known as investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS, in which companies can bring claims to an international tribunal when they believe their overseas investments were unfairly treated by an action from another Nafta government.

The U.S. has argued that the tribunals erode national sovereignty. But many U.S. companies have pressured the administration to preserve the dispute-settlement provisions, arguing that otherwise their international investments would be exposed and unprotected. Mexico and Canada have also favored keeping the provisions, believing they bolster the confidence of investors.

The Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, National Association of Manufacturers, and American Petroleum Institute are among major industry groups that have fought to preserve the dispute-settlement provisions.

An idea to resolve the impasse is for only certain industries to remain covered by dispute settlement. Negotiators have floated the idea with different industries, according to three sources from industries closely tracking the negotiations. Mexico and the U.S. don’t appear to have reached an agreement on the idea to exempt some industries but not others.

While a compromise on dispute settlement may bring some industry groups along, it could spark further opposition from the exempted industries that believe they are losing meaningful protection of their international investments. The strategy could split the united front that many business groups have advanced, with some major industries potentially welcoming a resolution, leaving behind a smaller group with objections.

The U.S. Trade Representative’s office didn’t respond to a request to comment. Mexican officials, approached as they entered a negotiating venue in Washington, declined to comment.

One idea that has been discussed is to retain industries that bid for government concessions as a crucial part of their business, including energy, utilities, mining, telecoms and services under the dispute-settlement process. Other major industries, including manufacturing and agriculture, wouldn’t be covered by the dispute-settlement provisions in this version of the proposal.

Mexico and the U.S. have signaled in recent days that they are making significant progress in resolving their remaining disagreements. But they have stressed nothing is final. Talks are set to continue over the weekend.

One source of delay could be a rift emerging between the current Mexican negotiating team, and that of President-elect Andrés Manuel Lòpez Obrador, who wants Mexico’s newly opened energy sector to be exempt from dispute resolution.

Geoffrey Gertz, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied dispute settlement, said that the system is more important for some industries than others.

“There is a logic to focusing on industries with high sunk costs and extensive regulation, as this is where investors are potentially most exposed to reversals in government policy,” he said.

But companies that aren’t covered might still be convinced to support the deal if it allows the Nafta negotiations to be resolved, he said.

“What I suspect matters most for firms considering investing in Mexico is stable, predictable, comprehensive access to the North American market, more so than the right to bring ISDS cases,” said Mr. Gertz.

Even if the U.S. and Mexico agreed to only retain dispute settlement for certain industries, Mexico and Canada could still agree bilaterally to keep the provisions for all their industries.

Mexico’s chief trade negotiator, Ildefonso Guajardo, said Friday that the U.S. and Mexico are “very far” down the list of issues needing to be worked out between the two countries, but said “even if you are extremely engaged, there is always a last-moment thing that can come between you and your goals.”

He said conclusion of the talks, including some of the most difficult remaining issues, would require the inclusion of the Canadians.

Asked about the U.S. position that Nafta should include a “sunset clause” which causes the deal to expire in five years, Mr. Guajardo responded that “it’s clear that there are trilateral issues that have to be solved in a trilateral context.”

"Mary McCartney, 48, is a fine-art photographer and author of several vegetarian cookbooks. Her latest book of photography is “The White Horse” (Rizzoli). She spoke with Marc Myers.

One of my earliest memories is my parents sitting me on a pony in Scotland. They carefully wrapped my hands around the horse’s mane and slowly walked me around. I must have been about a year old.

The pony’s name was Coconut. He was very kind and patient. I remember the coarse texture of his mane and how I held onto it tightly. Riding him that young gave me an early sense of pride and self-confidence.

As a family, we spent most summers together at a remote farmhouse on Scotland’s Kintyre peninsula. During the school year, we lived in central London.

Those summer stays were about seclusion and family. By spending long periods far away and close together, my parents, siblings and I were each other’s entertainment.

Growing up, I loved the Scottish landscape. The land wasn’t manicured or developed. It was open and wide, and the sky was expansive. Hills were covered in heather and bracken, and the fields were divided by old stone walls that had fallen apart in places. You could see for miles.

Our one-story, green-and-red stone farmhouse was a comfortable and simple home. We spent much of our time outdoors, with our horses, sheep and dogs.

Growing up with artistic parents was inspiring. My mother, Linda, was a professional photographer, and my father was Paul McCartney. In London, they took me to art exhibits. I was encouraged to observe, feel and express myself. My mother always had beautiful photography books around and we had contemporary artwork.

In Scotland and London, my mother and her cameras were inseparable. They were a part of her and always at the ready to take photos of images that moved her.

Mum was kind and gentle, comforting and elegant. She had a great sense of humor. She often left me alone with a camera to figure out my own artistic taste and sensibility.

There were two parts of me growing up. Either I was out and about in London and everyone was watching. Or, in stark contrast, I was in Scotland, surrounded by nature. Those extremes made me who I am.

At school in London, I was quite chatty and sociable. I was curious about people and wanted to know their personal stories. On holiday, in seclusion in Scotland, I could become more introspective. I’d ride off into the hills for adventures on my new pony, Sugar Foot.

Riding was the perfect way to explore the landscape. I had an opportunity to become more observant, taking in nature from my pony’s perspective. I felt safe.

Photography first became a passion in my teens. My mother was forthcoming with invaluable advice. We both processed our artistic viewpoint through our own personal experiences.

I also learned a great deal just by watching her. I feel like I inherited her eye. Mum was interested in nonperfect, authentic moments. We both strived to gain a subject’s trust and not rush a promising situation.

She also helped me develop a critical eye. During our summers in Scotland, I’d save up my rolls of film and have them developed at the lab when I got back to London. Then we’d go through the photographs and edit out our favorites together. I liked hearing her opinions.

After college, I had a job as a photo researcher at a music-book publisher. Then Mum invited me into her archive to look through all of her books of contact sheets.

This was the moment I became passionate about taking up photography professionally. I was 23 years old. And when I told my mother the news, she gave me one of her prized cameras—a Leica R7.

That Leica was the kind of camera that motivates you to take photographs. When I held it, I felt comfortable and inspired to go out on adventures and search for moments to capture in a single frame.

The camera’s sleek design made it easy to handle, and I loved the sound and feel of the shutter release. There was something about the click that was substantial and reassuring.

Today, my husband, Simon Aboud, and I live with our four children in central London, near Regent Park. It’s a Victorian apartment with lots of light. My favorite room is our bedroom. On a good day outside the bedroom windows I can watch the clouds float by and the trees sway in the breeze.

A couple of times a month, I drive down to stables in the countryside south of London to ride my white horse, Alejandro. He’s strong and kind and stunningly beautiful. We trust and calm each other as we explore the natural landscape.

Sadly, my mother passed away in 1998. I still have the Leica R7 she gave me. When I use it now, I feel as if she’s there with me, giving me advice and confidence. Just holding the camera takes me back to the day she gave it to me.

The Story Behind the Fab Photo

Mary McCartney on the back cover of Paul McCartney's 1970 solo album.

Perhaps my mother’s most famous photograph of me was taken in Scotland in 1969. When I was a little baby, my father, Paul, would put me inside his soft zip-up jacket when they went for a horse ride.

One day, after they returned to the farmhouse and my father dismounted, my mother took the image of my dad and me. It wasn’t preplanned or posed. My mother just caught the moment in the golden light of late afternoon.

My parents used the image on the back of my father’s “McCartney” album when it came out in early 1970. I looked pretty cozy in there.

"Michael Cohen had many reasons to play ball last weekend when his legal team sat down to talk to federal prosecutors.

The Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office had testimony from Mr. Cohen’s accountant and business partners, along with bank records, tax filings and loan applications that implicated not only Mr. Cohen in potential criminal activity, but also his wife, who filed taxes jointly with her husband. Prosecutors signaled Mr. Cohen would face nearly 20 criminal counts, potentially carrying a lengthy prison sentence and staggering financial penalties.

Adding to the pressure, David Pecker, the chairman of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, provided prosecutors with details about payments Mr. Cohen arranged with women who alleged sexual encounters with President Trump, including Mr. Trump’s knowledge of the deals.

This account of how Mr. Cohen went from a pugnacious defender of the president to turning on Mr. Trump is based on details provided by people close to Mr. Cohen and others briefed on the discussions with prosecutors.

For weeks, the president had been distancing himself from Mr. Cohen, including by stopping paying his longtime attorney’s legal fees, making clear amid the pressure that he was on his own.

Under oath on Tuesday, before a packed courtroom, Mr. Cohen created a spectacular moment without parallel in American history when he confessed to two crimes that he said he committed at the behest of the man who would become president.

Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes, including tax evasion and making false statements to a bank, capping a monthslong investigation into his business dealings and work as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer. For the president, it opens up a perilous new legal front.

Mr. Cohen in court said Mr. Trump directed him to arrange payments during the 2016 campaign to two women who alleged they had sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. The payments violated caps on campaign contributions and a ban on corporate contributions, prosecutors said.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump denied he directed Mr. Cohen to buy the women’s silence. Contradicting earlier statements, the president said he became aware of the payments to the women “later on” and said Mr. Cohen was reimbursed from his personal funds, not his 2016 campaign coffers.

The investigation is continuing, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Although the plea deal doesn’t require Mr. Cohen’s cooperation, it leaves the door open for him to talk with both the Southern District of New York and special counsel Robert Mueller. The court restricted Mr. Cohen’s travel to New York City; Chicago, where he owns taxi medallions; South Florida, where his parents live; and Washington, D.C., where the special counsel is based.

The deal doesn’t preclude further prosecutions, including other charges against Mr. Cohen.

Prosecutors built their case partly by using materials seized in April 9 raids of Mr. Cohen’s home, office and hotel, including recordings and other items that provided evidence of campaign-finance violations.

Investigators quickly zeroed in on Mr. Cohen’s relationship with American Media, including its role brokering deals on behalf of Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker had been an open supporter of Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Prosecutors say Mr. Pecker offered to help keep quiet negative stories about Mr. Trump that might come to the National Enquirer, a practice in the business known as “catch and kill.”

American Media executives were involved in both hush-money deals that formed the basis of Mr. Cohen’s guilty plea to campaign-finance violations, prosecutors said on Tuesday. One was a $130,000 payment to Stephanie Clifford—a former porn star who goes professionally by Stormy Daniels—as part of an agreement to keep her from publicly discussing an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. The payment was first reported by The Wall Street Journal in January.

The second was a $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her exclusive story of an alleged extramarital affair with Mr. Trump, a story that was purchased by American Media in August 2016 at Mr. Cohen’s urging, and then never published. The payment was first reported by the Journal in November 2016.

On April 5, days before the raids, Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One he didn’t know about the payment to Ms. Clifford, and referred questions about the matter to Mr. Cohen. “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen,” Mr. Trump said. “Michael is my attorney.”

Mr. Cohen, who that night was staying aboard the yacht of Trump donor Franklin Haney, which was docked in Miami, grew irate on the ship soon after Mr. Trump made his remarks distancing himself from the Clifford payment, according to a person familiar with the episode. Mr. Cohen was swearing loudly as others on the boat were sipping their drinks, the person said.

The search warrant executed on April 9 sought materials and information related to a wide range of communications, including ones related to the payments to Ms. Clifford and Ms. McDougal. At the same time, investigators subpoenaed Mr. Pecker, American Media and the Trump Organization, Mr. Trump’s business.

Prosecutors had reason to be concerned that without raiding Mr. Cohen’s office, “records could have been deleted without record and without recourse for law enforcement,” according to a court filing.

Prosecutors in the Southern District said the investigation into Mr. Cohen was, in part, a referral from the special counsel’s office. It isn’t clear when the referral took place, or if the office was already investigating Mr. Cohen when the referral came through.

The special counsel’s office was examining Mr. Cohen’s finances since at least October 2017, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Prior to the raids, investigators had already obtained covert search warrants on multiple email accounts used by Mr. Cohen, prosecutors said in a court filing. Early this year, they also had subpoenaed Mr. Cohen’s former accountant, Jeffrey A. Getzel, who handled Mr. Cohen’s personal and business tax returns.

In May, Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for Ms. Clifford, released a memo detailing payments made to Mr. Cohen from companies including AT&T Inc. and Novartis AG , as well as an investment firm linked to a Russian oligarch. Federal agents investigated whether Mr. Cohen lobbied Trump administration officials on the companies’ behalf without registering as a lobbyist, the Journal previously reported.

Initially, Mr. Cohen seemed unlikely to turn on the president. Although their relationship was at times turbulent, Mr. Trump appreciated Mr. Cohen’s absolute loyalty. On the day of the raids, Mr. Trump called the move a “disgrace” and a “witch hunt.”

Soon after the April raids, Mr. Cohen’s relationship with Mr. Trump began to deteriorate.

The estrangement began over legal bills, said a person who has spoken with Mr. Cohen about the matter. The Trump family covered part of Mr. Cohen’s legal fees after the raids, but then stopped paying.

Mr. Cohen felt exposed. Public comments by Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, put distance between the president and Mr. Cohen and further alienated the attorney, the person said.

Mr. Cohen told associates and friends he felt Mr. Trump didn’t have his back and vented that the president hadn’t personally offered to pay his legal bills in the Manhattan investigation, which he said were “bankrupting” him.

Mr. Cohen’s troubles increased in May, when Evgeny “Gene” Freidman, a New York City taxi mogul who managed taxi medallions owned by Mr. Cohen and his relatives, pleaded guilty to state criminal tax fraud and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in their probe of Mr. Cohen.

By then, prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service had focused on Mr. Cohen’s personal income taxes. In conversations with a potential witness in June and July, investigators asked “very pointed” questions about various tax filings, according to a person familiar with the conversations.

“They knew what they wanted, they knew what they had, and they went after it,” the person said.

In late June, Mr. Cohen openly broke with Mr. Trump.

A personal turning point for Mr. Cohen was a conversation with his father, Maurice Cohen, a Holocaust survivor.

Mr. Cohen’s father urged him not to protect the president, saying he didn’t survive the Holocaust to have his name sullied by Mr. Trump, according to a person who was told about the conversation. The elder Mr. Cohen couldn’t be reached for comment.

On June 20, Mr. Cohen stepped down from his position as the Republican National Committee’s deputy finance chairman and tweeted his first public criticism of his former boss: “As the son of a Polish holocaust survivor, the images and sounds of this family separation policy [are] heart wrenching.” The tweet no longer appears on Mr. Cohen’s Twitter account.

By then, Mr. Cohen had hired New York lawyer Guy Petrillo to represent him in the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s probe. The choice of Mr. Petrillo, who had once served as the chief of the office’s criminal division, was seen as a sign that Mr. Cohen hoped to cooperate. Mr. Petrillo began to signal this intent to prosecutors.

Shortly after Mr. Petrillo’s hiring, Mr. Cohen told ABC News in an interview that his first loyalty was to his family and country, not to the president.

In July, a recording became public that Mr. Cohen surreptitiously made of a conversation he had with Mr. Trump in September 2016 about buying the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story. The president has denied the affair.

The president’s legal team had waived attorney-client privilege on the recording, which had been seized in the April 9 raids.

The week of the recording’s release, the investigation appeared to accelerate, people familiar with the investigation said.

Federal prosecutors faced an early September deadline to charge Mr. Cohen. After that, they would have to wait until after the midterm elections, under Department of Justice guidelines, or risk criticism of potentially affecting the election’s outcome. They had follow-up witness interviews scheduled as recently as this week, a person familiar with the investigation said, but canceled them as the plea agreement came together over the weekend.

Given the Justice Department’s policy of not indicting sitting presidents, a guilty plea from Mr. Cohen and his public implication of Mr. Trump were among the strongest outcomes prosecutors could have hoped for, according to former federal prosecutors. For prosecutors, the guilty plea meant they could avoid a contentious trial and free up resources to pursue other investigations.

On Monday, Manhattan federal prosecutors filed a court document, in a case then labeled as U.S. v. John Doe, indicating a guilty plea was forthcoming.

By Tuesday night, hours after Mr. Cohen implicated Mr. Trump in a possible crime, one of Mr. Cohen’s lawyers, Lanny Davis, appeared on cable news shows to say Mr. Cohen wouldn’t accept a pardon from Mr. Trump and “is more than happy to tell the special counsel all that he knows.”

"Congress is poised to strengthen the procedures for vetting both foreign investments in the U.S. and overseas transactions involving cutting-edge American technology.

Negotiators from the Senate and the House reached a deal on the final text of the provision to bolster both the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. and the U.S. export-control system, in an effort to block Chinese and other foreign transactions that could harm national security.

The measure represents the first major change in a decade to the rules governing foreign investment reviews, and its impending passage follows a bruising battle among lawmakers and some of the country’s biggest companies.

“It’s a done deal,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R., Texas), one of the architects of the initiative, in a Thursday interview.

The provision, which has been attached to a must-pass military spending bill, could become law as soon as this month. First introduced as proposed legislation by Mr. Cornyn and Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.) in November 2017, the measure will affect both foreign firms seeking deals in the U.S. and American companies doing business abroad.

The measure will strengthen CFIUS’s authority to review foreign entities’ minority-position investments through venture-capital funds and other means, its ability to vet real-estate transactions near sensitive U.S. facilities, and its right to review any deal structured to evade the committee’s jurisdiction, such as transactions that use shell companies to obfuscate ownership. It will also bolster the export-controls process to review overseas transactions such as joint-venture agreements involving sensitive U.S. technology.

A secretive panel called CFIUS is paving the way for President Trump to block more foreign business deals due to national security concerns. WSJ's Shelby Holliday explains why you'll hear more about CFIUS during the Trump era. Illustration: Laura Kammerman

CFIUS is an interagency committee that reviews proposed foreign takeovers of U.S. businesses. The committee, led by the Treasury, can advise the president to block such deals on national-security grounds. Export controls regulate which U.S. technologies can be sent abroad.

President Donald Trump in June said he would rely on Congress’s CFIUS provision to address national-security concerns with Chinese investment instead of imposing his own set of restrictions.

“America’s technology will now have stronger protections commensurate with the challenges from China and other nations seeking to exploit our current laws,” said Mr. Pittenger on Thursday.

The impending legislative victory for China hawks in Congress hardly seemed a foregone conclusion until very recently. It followed a nearly two-year-long battle to gather support from an array of government agencies, businesses and lawmakers that often held strong—and opposing—views.

Mr. Cornyn began talking with Treasury officials about cracking down on certain foreign deals in October 2016, according to a person familiar with the matter. At that time, Chinese investment was pouring into the country, tripling to a record $46 billion by the end of the year, according to analysts at New York research firm Rhodium Group.

Mr. Cornyn has said he was particularly concerned that China was exploiting loopholes in the CFIUS process to acquire U.S. technology with military applications. A February 2017 report by DIUx, a Defense Department unit, laid out just how Chinese investors were doing so and provided a road map for some of the bill’s text.

China presents unique national security issues for the U.S. because it is both a key military and economic rival, and many deals involving Chinese companies may be directed and subsidized by the government.

Although Mr. Cornyn began gaining traction through personal outreach to cabinet officials at the Treasury, Defense and Justice Departments—which are all heavy hitters on CFIUS—one early concern was the level of support across the aisle. While many Democrats were eager to crack down on China, some proposed expanding CFIUS’s remit beyond matters of national security to include issues such as economic competitiveness, which would have been a deal breaker for many Republicans. Ultimately the legislation attracted wide bipartisan support, including from co-sponsors Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.).

On the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Cornyn and his allies faced stiff opposition from major businesses such as International Business Machines Corp. and General Electric Co. , which publicly criticized an earlier iteration of the bill as overly broad. The companies took particular issue with an initial plan to widen CFIUS’s remit beyond inbound investment to include deals struck abroad as well.

Expanding CFIUS’s jurisdiction to include U.S. firms’ investments in joint ventures around the world “would generate thousands of additional cases for an already under-resourced CFIUS system, reduce the likelihood of a coordinated approach with our closest allies and needlessly damage American companies and their workers seeking to compete abroad,” a GE lobbyist wrote in a March letter published in The Wall Street Journal in response to an op-ed by Mr. Pittenger published in the Journal two days earlier.

Mr. Cornyn hit back in an April speech on the Senate floor. “These joint ventures are essentially acquisitions by another name, which is why CFIUS should be able to review them for national-security risks,” he said, adding that those criticizing his proposal were only doing so “so they can bolster their bottom line.”

To overcome the impasse, lawmakers in both chambers agreed in May to amend the measure’s text to leave reviews of U.S. companies’ transactions abroad to a strengthened export-controls process, as opposed to giving CFIUS jurisdiction to review them.

While the deal paved the way for the measure’s inclusion in the must-pass defense bill, which greatly increased its chances of becoming law, it left some China hawks concerned that the resulting legislation won’t do enough to protect U.S. technology.

Soon, the initiative’s proponents had another problem. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) mounted an extraordinary, last-ditch effort to derail the CFIUS measure due to concerns it would overly restrict foreign investment.

Mr. Ryan excluded from recent CFIUS negotiations lawmakers with national-security expertise, such as members of the House Armed Services and Intelligence panels, as well as Mr. Pittenger, according to people familiar with the matter. A House GOP aide said Mr. Ryan followed past precedent and deferred to relevant committee chairmen on whom to name to negotiating panels. Mr. Ryan also told conferees it was important to get the CFIUS provision right, and “we will take all the time we need to do that,” according to the House GOP aide.

Mr. Hensarling, whose committee has jurisdiction over CFIUS, said in an interview earlier this week that he met with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin several times to discuss the measure, and with Mr. Ryan’s backing, threatened to remove the CFIUS provision from the defense bill if negotiators didn’t change the language. The move could have indefinitely postponed the passage of the CFIUS changes.

Mr. Hensarling has long been hostile to the CFIUS measure, according to people familiar with the matter. For example, he invited an array of witnesses who opposed the bill to testify at a handful of committee hearings on it and rejected a proposal by Mr. Pittenger to have a senior Treasury proponent speak about the bill at a committee retreat for Republican members earlier this year, one of the people said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hensarling said he worked for months, “holding numerous hearings and security briefings, in order to reach agreement on a House bill that passed the committee with unanimous support and balanced national security concerns with protecting personal freedom and economic opportunity.”

Still, the final effort by House GOP leadership to make material changes to the CFIUS measure was largely unsuccessful following pushback from cabinet officials and Vice President Mike Pence, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Pence’s office said that the vice president met with Mr. Trump and key legislators on the matter, and wanted to make sure the CFIUS provision wasn’t watered down to the point that it weakened national security.

Mr. Hensarling said in a Wednesday interview that the negotiations had resulted in “a lot of give and take.” Rep. Mac Thornberry (R., Texas), the top House negotiator on the defense bill that contains the CFIUS measure, said he expects the bill to get a vote next week.

"PERAST, Montenegro—Vladimir Milinović has seen Western tourism in his Balkan village swell so much, he now knows who is likely to tip, and who will try to haggle down the €5 (nearly $6) he charges for a short boat ride.

“We like Americans because they are very generous,” said Mr. Milinović, as he navigated his motorboat to a picturesque island near the village called Our Lady of the Rocks. “If somebody tries to get a cheaper price we know they are probably French.”

So many tourists are descending on Europe this summer—drawn in part by the strong dollar—that a growing number are looking beyond the continent’s famous destinations, leaving hardly a spot on the map unvisited. As the lines stretch longer outside Notre-Dame in Paris, and the crush gets greater on Saint Mark’s Square in Venice, even tiny Montenegro is enjoying its place in the sun.

In well-trodden Europe, you can’t get much more off the beaten track than this Balkan country smaller than Connecticut, whose pristine beaches and landscape were relatively obscure until recently.

Conditions could hardly be better for Europe, which takes the lion’s share of global tourism revenues globally. The rising dollar and strong U.S. economy are drawing more Americans here. Russians have begun to travel again in Europe, especially in the Balkans, after a hiatus for Russia’s economic downturn. And the growing number of Chinese who visit Europe are staying longer, venturing beyond whistle-stop tours to delve more deeply into the continent’s culture offerings.

International overnight stays in Europe rose 7% in the first four months of 2018 compared with the same period last year, building on what the United Nations’ tourism organization called a “remarkable” 8% increase in 2017. Above all, Europe’s continuing economic upswing has led to strongly rising tourism within the continent, especially from Germany. Tourism industry executives expect the good times to continue.

The sector’s boom began several years ago, spurred by Europe’s emergence from its financial crisis, and has proved largely impervious to Europe’s other woes, from the migration crisis to terrorism.

With Europe remaining one of the world’s safest and most politically stable regions, destinations such as Spain and Greece have benefited from people’s security fears about vacationing in the Middle East and North Africa. Even European cities that suffered terrorist attacks in recent years, such as Paris in 2015 and Brussels in 2016, saw temporary dips in tourism before bouncing back within about a year and joining the wider boom.

The trend of tourists seeking out locations that were once considered second tier is evident even in Spain, whose 82 million foreign guests in 2017 made it the world’s second-most visited country after France. In the first half of this year, foreign tourists in Spain’s 11 least-visited regions, including the Basque Country, were about one-third higher than in the same period in 2016, while visitors to Andalusia and the Canary Islands, two of the country’s top destinations, were up a more modest 12% and 7%, respectively, in that time.

The boom is bringing back fond memories for Montenegro. It was a popular destination for Yugoslavs, but it didn’t see many foreign guests for a long time after Communism fell. Last year, 1 million tourists visited this country of 650,000 inhabitants, according to the national statistics office, a 19% rise from the year before. In the first four months of 2018, numbers were up another 20% on the year.

Tourism generated about €1 billion for Montenegro in 2017, a third of the country’s gross domestic product. In Europe, only Croatia has faster tourism growth.

Caleb Wang, a 20-year-old history student at the University of Chicago, said it never would have even occurred to him to visit Montenegro. But he ended up in the medieval town of Kotor, near Perast, on a cruise with his parents that left from Venice and followed the Croatian and Montenegrin coasts.

“I’d heard Croatia was beautiful, but I didn’t expect Montenegro would be this nice,” said Mr. Wang. “You can see why tourism is booming here.”

Montenegro is scrambling to build and refurbish hotels and improve its roads. Kotor plans to renovate the 1,350 stone steps, many in a parlous state, that lead steeply up to its formidable fortress.

The only road through Kotor, a Unesco World Heritage site with about 2,500 inhabitants that gets up to 15,000 tourists a day in high summer, is often jammed with traffic. On a recent sunny day, the old town was awash with visitors from a cruise ship.

When the first cruise ship docked at Kotor just over a decade ago, the town celebrated, and the event made the national evening television news. Now an average of a ship a day stops here. One day this August, four ships queued for a berth.

“People ask me what’s wrong if there isn’t a tour ship docked,” said Ana Nives Radović, the town’s tourism director. “The number of tourists here is still acceptable,” she said. But if there is another decade of such growth, “it might start getting out of hand.”

"Coinbase Inc., the operator of the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is setting up shop in Japan, where much of the world’s bitcoin trading takes place.

The San Francisco-based company named Nao Kitazawa, a former Morgan Stanley banker turned fintech executive, as its new Japan CEO. Coinbase said it is working with Japanese regulators to ensure it complies with local laws. It didn’t offer a time frame for when it expects to commence operations.

Coinbase, which was founded in 2012 and runs the largest U.S. digital-currency exchange by volume, said it currently operates in 32 countries including Singapore. Yet it has lacked a significant presence in Asia, one of the driving forces behind bitcoin’s surge last year.

“As a regulated, compliant crypto company in the U.S., we will focus on building that same level [of] trust with new customers in Japan,” Dan Romero, vice president and general manager of Coinbase, wrote on the company’s blog. He said the expansion was part of Coinbase’s efforts “to accelerate the global adoption of cryptocurrency.”

Japan has long been a hotbed for cryptocurrency trading. Rules that took effect in Japan last year established bitcoin as a legitimate payment method and helped the digital currency flourish in the country. About two-thirds of bitcoin trading is yen-denominated, according to data provider Coinhills.

But Japanese regulators have tightened their grip on the market in recent months, after cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc. in January lost more than $500 million in customer funds. Regulators have since suspended operations at some exchanges.

Exchange operators have had mixed success in Japan. In April, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken said it was ending its trading services for Japanese residents. Also in April, internet brokerage Monex Group Inc. said it was buying Coincheck for $34 million and aimed to fully restore its operations. Messaging-app operator Line Corp. is one of several companies waiting on regulatory approval to open a cryptocurrency exchange.

Coinbase operates a popular app that people use for storing, trading and transferring bitcoin and collects fees when customers buy or sell the cryptocurrency. At one point in December, Coinbase was the most-downloaded free app in Apple Inc.’s App Store. The company has been trying to branch out beyond its core base of U.S. individual investors, and last month unveiled plans for new services aimed at hedge funds and other big investors, such as brokering large-scale cryptocurrency trades.

The price of bitcoin recently traded at around $7,400, according to research site CoinDesk. It has lost more than half its value since peaking near $20,000 in December. Still, it is significantly higher from early 2017, when it started the year below $1,000.

"ISTANBUL—The Turkish lira’s fall has been sudden and sharp. The cause traces back nearly a decade when the country’s leader decided to turn Turkey into something resembling China on a smaller scale, a world-class economy under one man’s firm control.

Eager to pull his nation out of an economic contraction that had marred much of the world at the start of 2009, Recep Tayyip Erdogan signed a decree easing access to foreign-exchange loans for Turkish companies.

The new rules lifted restrictions that barred companies without revenue in hard currencies from doing such borrowing—as long as the loans exceeded $5 million. “It was tantamount to saying: If you drink, drink a lot,” said one official in Ankara, Turkey’s capital.

In the following years, Turkish companies gorged on euro and dollar loans, granting Mr. Erdogan’s wish of brawny economic expansion that helped him and his ruling Justice and Development Party power through successive national and local elections. Memories of the 2009 recession evaporated, as did those of the 1990s crisis that had led Turkey to seek international assistance.

Mr. Erdogan was, in effect, mirroring in ways the approach of Chinese President Xi Jinping and his party, which consolidated political power in an authoritarian regime and encouraged heavy borrowing to supercharge the economy.

Turkey’s financial trouble shows the limitation of that approach, especially for countries more susceptible to the forces of global finance and without the kind of control exerted by China’s Communist Party. Vulnerabilities in the Turkish expansion model were so severe it took only two tweets by President Trump in recent weeks—one announcing sanctions against two Turkish officials and another on the doubling of some tariffs—to spark panic.

Nonfinancial corporations built a $330 billion debt pile that is now at the heart of global investor concerns over Turkey’s perilous financial situation. Compounded by a protracted dispute with the U.S. over the fate of an American pastor, those concerns have caused a currency debacle, with the Turkish lira collapsing to its lowest level ever against the dollar on Monday.

Although the lira pared some of its losses, it has shed roughly a third of its value against the dollar since the start of the year. On Friday, the lira sank more than 4% against the dollar after the U.S. administration threatened new penalties against the country over its detention of the pastor, Andrew Brunson. In late European trading Friday, a dollar bought 6.12 lira; a month ago, it bought 4.75.

The lira’s drop has sent ripples through the global financial system, raising concerns about the exposure of some European banks and denting investor appetite for emerging markets.

“It feels like going back to the 1990s,” when a deep Turkish financial crisis had ripple effects on global finance, said Zumrut Imamoglu, chief economist at Tusiad, one of Turkey’s leading industry and business-lobbying groups.

Among businessmen caught on the wrong side of the lira is Atilla Kulekcioglu. In April, Citir Usta, the food chain he founded in 2003, filed for protection from creditors over debt of more than 10 million lira. Mr. Kulekcioglu said he had always resisted the temptation of contracting foreign-currency loans because clients pay in lira for the pide, a Turkish dish similar to flatbread he serves at his restaurants.

Yet, the shopping malls that house his outlets, built on the back of euro or dollar loans, charge rents indexed on foreign currencies, he said. Unable to pass on the higher rent costs to his customers, Mr. Kulekcioglu said he closed 25 of his 65 restaurants and began scouting for foreign investors. “We were one of the four biggest chains in the sector,” he said.

Investor concerns over Turkey’s vulnerable finances have long been pervasive, especially as Mr. Erdogan consolidated his one-man rule and increased his sway over the central bank and monetary policy. In the spring, Mr. Erdogan called snap elections. And in June, he won a new five-year mandate that came with expanded executive powers, securing his political future before those concerns took hold.

The currency storm was a far cry from Mr. Erdogan’s electoral promise to place Turkey among the world’s top 10 economies by the end of his term from its current rank of 17th. As the lira storm raged last weekend, the president was touring the Black Sea region, delivering speeches to thank voters for his re-election. He made no mention of the corporate-debt challenge. Rather, he denounced the tariffs the U.S. has introduced on some Turkish imports as an “act of economic war.”

“Once again, we are facing a surreptitious political plot,” he told supporters in the Black Sea town of Trabzon on Sunday. “God permitting, we will overcome this.”

On Thursday, Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak—Mr. Erdogan’s son-in-law—said on a conference call with about 3,000 investors and financial analysts that the lira rout was excessive and didn’t reflect Turkey’s core economic strength.

Economists say years of heavy corporate borrowing, during which liquidity minted by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks met Mr. Erdogan’s thirst for higher economic growth, has reached a limit.

Refet Gurkaynak, a professor of economics at the Bilkent University in Ankara, said souring U.S. relations were a trigger that awakened investors to the reality of Turkey’s financial pain.

“The problem here is that our corporate sector is deeply, deeply indebted,” he said, warning of a looming rise in defaults and layoffs. “You can’t dump all the corporate problems on the banks, so there will have to be some sharing of the problems by the banks and the government, hence the public.”

Turkish officials didn’t reply to messages seeking comment. During his call with investors, Mr. Albayrak said the government would announce a detailed action plan in September.

At the start of his national political career, Mr. Erdogan cut a more accommodating figure. When he became prime minister in 2003, Turkey was two years into a bailout plan run by the International Monetary Fund, receiving billions of dollars of loans in exchange for implementing the fund’s recipe of fiscal and budget rigor.

Carrying out the remaining IMF measures, Turkey reaped the benefits with lower inflation and a jump in exports, becoming a darling of emerging-market investors. Europeans greeted Mr. Erdogan as a strategic partner and, in December 2004, the European Union formally granted Turkey the right to begin accession talks, kicking off large aid and investment programs.

At a conference around that time at the European Parliament, Franco-German lawmaker Daniel Cohn-Bendit walked up to the Turkish leader, video of the meeting shows. “Mr. Erdogan, I have a present for you,” the lawmaker said, handing him a coin. “The first euro in Turkish.”

With the flow of money, Turkey became a construction site, as Mr. Erdogan, who had developed a penchant for infrastructure projects when he was Istanbul’s mayor in the 1990s, launched train, highway and bridge projects. Istanbul’s skyline, which counted 19 high-rises when he became prime minister, now has 98, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, a Chicago-based nonprofit.

In 2007, his honeymoon with the EU took a hit. Several European leaders, such as then-President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, publicly said they would veto Turkey’s membership to the bloc.

In 2008, the IMF assistance program expired. Mr. Erdogan minimized the fund’s role, instead crediting his own stewardship for Turkey’s economic miracle and vowing to follow his own course.

Durmus Yilmaz, an opposition lawmaker, said Mr. Erdogan and his ruling AKP party began behaving more confidently. “After 2008, they felt they knew better,” said Mr. Yilmaz, a former governor of Turkey’s central bank.

That is when the global recession hit Turkey. In the first quarter of 2009, the Turkish economy shrank more than 13%. The government switched to expansionary measures such as the easing on foreign-currency loans.

Within months, the Turkish economy was back on its feet. Mr. Erdogan wanted more growth and didn’t reduce budget spending. “With demand increasing a lot in an economy that was already at full capacity,” said Mr. Gurkaynak, the economics professor, “we began to run the humongous current-account deficit and inflation began to creep up.”

In May 2013, then Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan boasted that Turkey had finished paying its $23.5 billion IMF debt. “For the first time in 19 years, Turkey owes no debt to the IMF,” Mr. Babacan said after initiating the final wire transfers from a computer at Turkey’s central-bank headquarters.

Two weeks later, two tremors shook Turkey. One came from the U.S., where then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled in an address to Congress that years of Fed stimulus might come to an end. For Turkey, the message was a warning that the days of easy access to foreign funding, vital to plugging holes in its current account, could be numbered.

The other occurred in Istanbul, where a small sit-in protesting the destruction of the tree-lined Gezi park escalated into nationwide, often-violent protests against Mr. Erdogan’s increasingly authoritarian rule.

Mr. Bernanke’s speech and the political upheaval weighed on the lira, which lost ground against the dollar, heightening pressure on the Turkish central bank to raise interest rates. But Mr. Erdogan vetoed a rate increase. In a series of speeches in June, he blamed what he called “the interest-rate lobby” for the Gezi protests and negative pressure on the lira.

“He believes the economy works in a way that is different from what the faculty says” in economic literature, said Mr. Yilmaz, the former central-bank governor.

After a failed coup in July 2016, the Turkish economy shrank abruptly. The emergency rule introduced by the government spooked foreign companies, which sharply cut direct investment.

Last year, the government dramatically expanded its support to small companies through a state fund that guaranteed bank loans worth about 200 billion lira in total, up from about 15 billion in 2016. Economists say the move helped turbocharge the Turkish economy to a growth rate of 7.4% in 2017, the highest of all Group of 20 economies.

At the start of 2018, the lira was falling on simmering concerns over Turkey’s large corporate debt. Some of the president’s advisers talked on television about the need to cool Turkey’s economic engine after such a bewildering run.

But surrounded by businessmen in a hall of the presidential complex in April, Mr. Erdogan distributed framed “incentive certificates” as he announced another $34 billion stimulus program.

“Some people say ‘too much growth is not a good thing,’ ” he said. “Why? Because they are jealous. It is nothing else.”

The fallout has been harsh on companies such as partly state-owned Turk Telekom , Turkey’s largest phone operator. Last month, it blamed a second-quarter net loss of 889 million lira on “unfavorable forex movements,” saying almost all of its bank borrowings, which stood at 14.7 billion lira as of June 30, were in dollars and euros. Stripping out those effects, it said, it would have posted a net profit of 676 million lira.

“Turk Telekom has debt in foreign currencies but this is at a manageable level and actually is a low amount,” a Turk Telekom spokeswoman said Friday.

Having announced this spring his intention to seek a new mandate, Mr. Erdogan hit the campaign trail. He promised that a landmark mosque in Istanbul and the city’s new airport, cast as the world’s biggest, would soon be completed. He announced details of a grand project to connect the Black and Marmara seas with a canal that would house a population of seven million along its banks.

In May, the lira’s drop intensified after the president told a London conference he intended to have a bigger say in monetary policy in the future. In a bid to support the Turkish currency, the central bank sharply raised interest rates. That same month, the government reintroduced most of the restrictions on foreign-currency loans it had lifted in 2009.

“That was too late,” said Ms. Imamoglu, the Tusiad economist. “They should have done it before 2015.”

"Chinese navy ships off Alaska in recent days weren’t just operating in the area for the first time: They also came within 12 nautical miles of the coast, making a rare foray into U.S. territorial waters, according to the Pentagon.

Pentagon officials said late Thursday that the five Chinese navy ships had passed through U.S. territorial waters as they transited the Aleutian Islands, but said they had complied with international law and didn’t do anything threatening.

“This was a legal transit of U.S. territorial seas conducted in accordance with the Law of the Sea Convention,” said Pentagon spokesman Cmdr. Bill Urban.

U.S. officials said there was no known official communication to the U.S. from the ships.

The passage was seen as significant as Beijing has long objected to U.S. Navy vessels transiting its territorial waters or operating in international waters just outside.

China’s Defense Ministry confirmed that its navy ships had sailed to the Bering Sea for training after joint exercises with Russia in late August, but said the activity was routine and not aimed at any particular country.

U.S. officials said earlier that they were tracking the five ships in the area, where they hadn’t seen the Chinese navy operating before, but they didn’t say how close the ships had come to U.S. territory.

The foray, just as President Barack Obama was visiting Alaska, threw a fresh spotlight on China’s expanding naval power and ambitions on the eve of a lavish military parade in Beijing. It also came just three weeks before China’s President, Xi Jinping, begins a state visit to the U.S. already clouded by tensions over alleged cyberattacks on the U.S. and China’s island-building in the South China Sea.

TK

The flotilla apparently traveled east from somewhere near Russia and entered the Bering Sea, navigating north of the Aleutian Islands before transiting south, where they undertook the “innocent passage” through U.S. waters between two islands, a defense official said.

That principle allows military ships to transit foreign territorial waters if they don’t conduct threatening activity. The Chinese didn’t give prior notification to the U.S. before doing so, but under international law, they don’t need to.

The Chinese don’t always acknowledge those laws, however, according to U.S. defense reports. For example, Beijing claims that U.S. warships should request permission before making their own “innocent passage” in Chinese territorial waters.

During fiscal years 2012 and 2013, the Pentagon challenged this notion, deploying U.S. naval ships through Chinese territorial waters without notifying Beijing first. According to those reports, the U.S. did not make the same challenge during fiscal 2014. There is no data available for the current fiscal year.

U.S. officials believe China is building a “blue-water” navy capable of operating far from its shores, while also developing missiles and other capabilities designed to prevent the U.S. Navy from intervening in a conflict in Asia.

Many of those capabilities, including a new antiship ballistic missile, were put on display for the first time on Thursday during the parade to mark the surrender of Japanese forces at the end of World War II.

Some U.S. military experts saw the Chinese transit through the Aleutians as a positive step, in that they had adhered to the “innocent passage” principle.

“As a matter of fairness and equity, these operations are a big step forward for U.S. interests in that Beijing now has no basis to object to similar passage through China’s territorial sea by the U.S., for instance in vicinity of China’s islands in the South China Sea,” said Peter Dutton, director of the China Maritime Studies Institute at the U.S. Naval War College.

China took another step in that direction last year during the U.S.-led Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC, joint naval drills in Hawaii.

U.S. officials said then that an uninvited Chinese spy ship had observed the drills from international waters. China’s Defense Ministry said that its operations complied with international law.

Still, Mr. Dutton and other experts said it was doubtful that China would suddenly stop objecting to U.S. naval ships passing through its waters or conducting surveillance nearby.

Pentagon officials said in May they were drawing up plans to send U.S. Navy ships or aircraft within 12 nautical miles of artificial islands that China has been building in the disputed South China Sea.

Later that month, China expressed “strong dissatisfaction” and accused the U.S. of irresponsible and dangerous action after a U.S. Navy surveillance jet flew close to the islands, but not within 12 nautical miles.

China has also repeatedly demanded that the U.S. cease surveillance operations within its exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, which under international law extends 200 nautical miles from the coast.

For that reason, Beijing would likely say its ships off Alaska weren't conducting surveillance, although they probably were, said Taylor Fravel, an expert on China’s military at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

“China faces contradictory impulses to limit the activities of foreign navies within its own EEZ and to operate within the EEZs of others,” he said. “Over time, especially as China’s military becomes even more capable, it could downplay objections to the activities of foreign navies in its EEZ as it seeks to operate more frequently out of the region.”

China’s Defense Ministry didn’t respond to questions about which ships were in the flotilla near Alaska or how close they came to U.S. territory.

The joint exercises with Russia ran from Aug. 20-28 off the Russian Pacific coast—about 2,000 miles west of the Bering Sea—according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Seven Chinese ships took part, including two destroyers, two frigates, two landing ships and one supply ship, Xinhua said.

U.S. officials said the five ships near the Aleutians included three Chinese combat ships, a supply vessel and an amphibious landing ship.

"The U.S. and Canada will resume efforts on Wednesday to resolve issues holding up a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is set to meet U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington after the U.S. and Mexico last week agreed to terms on their portion of the trilateral accord. The focus this week will be on Ottawa and Washington bridging differences to keep all three countries signatories to an update of the quarter-century-old treaty.

President Trump, who has long derided the Nafta treaty as a “disaster,” reiterated over the Labor Day Weekend that if U.S. and Canada fail to reach a deal his administration could move forward on a deal that excludes Canada. He also warned Congress not to interfere.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday his negotiating team is ready to work on a deal that benefits all parties. “There are a number of things that we absolutely must see in a renegotiated Nafta,” he said at a media event in a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia. “No Nafta is better than a bad Nafta deal for Canadians, and that’s what we are going to stay with.”

The White House has formally notified Congress of an intent to sign a new version of Nafta this autumn with Mexico—saying Canada was free to join, “if willing.” The U.S. administration is widely expected to start the process of withdrawing from the old treaty while preparing for congressional ratification of the new one.

It is unclear what the new timetable is for reaching an accord allowing Canada to join. After the two sides failed to reach an agreement last week, people familiar with the process said that new deadline could extend to Sept. 30. That is when, according to U.S. law, the Trump administration would need to make public final text for a trade pact that he could sign by Nov. 30, when Mexico’s leader leaves office.

“We agreed to something we think the Canadians should sign up with, and so we’re very very confident that the talks are going to go well this week and that we’re going to have Canada on board relatively soon,” said Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, on Fox Business Network.

Many U.S. lawmakers, business groups and labor leaders have insisted that Canada remain part of a three-way deal, which allows for duty-free trade that fuels the North American auto industry and other sectors. Mexico has also expressed a preference for Canada to remain, but has signaled willingness to move forward without it.

The stakes are high, as the Trump administration has sought to bring maximum pressure to bear on its closest neighbors, even imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico on national security grounds.

As talks with Canada resume, the biggest sticking point is Canada’s insistence on retaining a dispute-resolution system that allows member states to challenge trade penalties imposed by the others. Mr. Lighthizer has proposed eliminating the system, contained in Nafta’s Chapter 19, and Mexico has agreed to that. But Canada remains unwilling to scrap the mechanism.

“Ensuring everyone plays fair within the Nafta accord is something we can all understand is important,” Mr. Trudeau said. “We need a dispute-resolution mechanism like Chapter 19, and we will hold firm on that.”

Trump administration officials have complained the dispute process erodes U.S. sovereignty, saying the independent panels charged with adjudicating the cases have primarily been used to overturn tariffs imposed by the U.S. Commerce Department on Canadian and Mexican products.

The U.S. and Canada remain far apart on other contentious issues.

Canada has told artistic groups it will fight attempts by U.S. officials to dilute a cultural exemption now in Nafta aimed at protecting the domestic music, television and film sectors. The exemption is meant to ensure Canadian-made productions are broadcast. It is viewed as crucial to the French-speaking province of Quebec—a vote-rich region and a minority in mostly Anglophone North America—and in cities in media centers such as Toronto and Vancouver, which the governing Liberals rely on for support.

“The cultural exemption must stand,” Mr. Trudeau said. “It would be giving up of our sovereignty and our identity.”

Other issues where the U.S. and Canada are at odds include greater U.S. access to the Canadian dairy market; intellectual property; and duty-free treatment of small amounts of goods purchased in the U.S. On top of that, the U.S. and Canada must still address the fate of American tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, which prompted retaliatory tariffs from Ottawa.

“The Canadians don’t compromise easily—these are big political issues in Canada, particularly in dairy,” said William Reinsch, a former U.S. official at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “It’s got to be tempting to give [Mr. Trump] a giant middle finger and just walk away.”

The two countries notched some progress in talks last week, with Nafta chapters dealing with the environment and labor close to completion, said two people familiar with the talks.

Business and labor groups are anxiously following what happens next. The Dairy Farmers of Canada, an industry lobby group, said its members were unwilling to eliminate production quotas and tariffs that aim to thwart foreign competition. The group says the industry is already on course to lose roughly C$250 million in sales due to concessions Canada made on dairy to secure trade deals with the European Union and Pacific-Rim countries.

"MADRID—Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered in Barcelona on Tuesday in a quest to restore momentum to their bid to secede from Spain, a sign of the intractable political clash that confronts the recently appointed Spanish prime minister.

Demonstrators stretched along several miles of Barcelona’s main avenue shouted “independence!” in a show of strength to mark an annual event celebrating the culture and history of Spain’s Catalonia region. They were also a multitudinous reminder for Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez that many Catalans haven’t abandoned their goal of eventual independence, despite a failed attempt to secede from the rest of Spain last autumn.

Joaquim “Quim” Torra, the regional president and a hard-line separatist, said the regional government will honor the results of an unauthorized independence referendum held last year, when a majority of Catalans who cast their ballots voted in favor of secession. Millions of other Catalans boycotted the illegal vote. “Our government has committed to make the republic a reality,” Mr. Torra said in a televised address in Barcelona.

Mr. Torra hasn’t provided details on how to overcome the Spanish central government’s steadfast opposition to make Catalonia an independent republic. Instead, he’s called on pro-independence supporters to fill the streets to mark the coming anniversaries of the Oct. 1 illegal referendum and the subsequent independence declaration. Madrid responded to last autumn’s declaration by ousting Mr. Torra’s predecessor and other Catalan leaders and seizing temporary control of the region.

Since the center-left Mr. Sánchez became prime minister in June, he has tried to reduce tensions with Catalan separatist leaders. The premier has met with Mr. Torra, pledging more dialogue and floating the possibility that Catalans could vote on more autonomy within Spain.

Catalonia, an engine of Spain’s economy and home to 7.5 million people, already controls its own police force and oversees its schools and health care system.

Despite the shift in tone by Mr. Sánchez, the standoff between Spain and its most restless region continues. Mr. Sánchez insists he will not authorize a referendum on Catalan independence and has signaled that national authorities would respond to any unauthorized referendum by again seizing temporary control of the regional government.

“What are the pillars of the Spanish government’s policy toward Catalonia? [Upholding the] law and dialogue,” Mr. Sánchez told lawmakers on Tuesday in Madrid.

A majority of Spaniards agrees with Mr. Sánchez’s firm stance against secession. Only one in 10 Spaniards support granting Catalonia and Spain’s 16 regions the possibility to become independent, according to a survey in July by Spain’s Center for Sociological Research, a figure that has held steady in recent years.

In Catalonia, voters are much more divided. Forty percent of Catalans want Catalonia to be an independent country, according to a poll conducted in June and July by the region’s survey agency. About one-quarter of those surveyed support Catalonia’s current status as an autonomous region, while 22% want more autonomy within a more decentralized Spain, which would make Catalonia somewhat akin to a U.S. state.

Some separatist leaders, who think they still lack enough popular support for full independence, are aiming to build majority support for secession over time. Mr. Torra and other hard-liners, however, want to raise the pressure on Madrid to grant an independence referendum as soon as possible.

Faced with such divisions, separatists have focused more in recent months on what unites them: Their anger at the jail time their nine fellow separatist leaders are serving while they await trial. Spanish prosecutors have charged the ringleaders of last autumn’s unauthorized referendum and subsequent declaration of independence with rebellion against the Spanish state. Their trial is expected later this year. Other separatists, including former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, fled Spain for other European countries to avoid arrest in what they say is a politicized justice system.

Separatists have called on Mr. Sánchez to release their colleagues but the prime minister has insisted he has no control over the trial. Separatists have been papering Catalonia’s fences, benches, traffic posts and bridges with yellow ribbons to show support for jailed and exiled colleagues.

The yellow ribbons are controversial with many Catalans who want to stay part of Spain. Some Catalan opponents of secession have been snipping the ribbons away, triggering arguments in the streets.

"MILAN— Starbucks Corp. SBUX -0.27% opens a coffee shop on average every four hours somewhere in the world. But this store is different. It is the first one for Italy.

On Friday, the Seattle-based chain started selling its American take on coffee in the home of espresso. After amassing more than 25,000 coffee shops in 78 countries, Starbucks has coming to Milan with a “reserve roastery” in a converted post office on a central square near the city’s famous Gothic cathedral.

It is only Starbucks’s third roastery after Seattle and Shanghai. In a sign of the expected difficulty in winning over tradition-obsessed Italians, there will be no Frappuccinos or other blended drinks on offer. It will be as much about theater as coffee. Customers can speak to a Starbucks employee manning a large custom-built roaster in the middle of the cafe, sip alcoholic drinks in the evening in a nod to Milan’s traditional aperitivo, and eat pizza and pastries made in a wood-fired brick oven by noted Milanese baker Princi.

“It’s a reflection of the fact that we come here with great respect for the Italian coffee experience,” Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said in an interview.

It is that experience that inspired Howard Schultz, who after a visit to Milan 35 years ago began the transformation that would turn Starbucks into the behemoth it is today.

Starbucks has been focusing on expanding abroad, especially in China, to offset stagnant sales in the U.S., where Starbucks is closing stores.

The Milan Starbucks is opening during a moment of ferment for the coffee industry. Coca-Cola Co. last week announced it would buy British coffee-shop chain Costa for $5.1 billion while Nestlé SA this year bought the rights to sell Starbucks products in retail stores.

Milanese coffee drinkers will have to wait a little to get their first local Caramel Cocoa Cluster Frappuccino. Starbucks plans to open its first normal coffee shops in the city by the end of year. Mr. Johnson said the sites have been identified and work on them has begun. He declined to say how much had been invested in the first Milan roastery or how many of the traditional Starbucks cafes would be opened.

The multilevel Milan roastery features a bar with a 30-foot countertop cut from a single piece of Tuscan marble. Other draws include outdoor seating in one of Milan’s most central squares, a glass ceiling and an entire wall depicting the company’s history engraved in brass.

Later this year, Starbucks will inaugurate a similar roastery in New York near Chelsea Market with openings in Tokyo and Chicago planned for 2019.

For Italians who like to knock back their €1 ($1.16) shot of espresso at speed—while standing at a crowded bar, naturalmente—the American way of lingering in a Starbucks could be a tough sell.

Even tougher might be getting Italians, and Milan’s tourists, to swallow the €1.80 price of an espresso and the €5 cappuccino, more than three times the going price in hundreds of other bars in Milan. And toughest of all could be getting the Italians to accept that a cappuccino can be “short,” “tall” or “grande.”

“It’s going to be difficult to draw us away from our usual bar, but we’ll definitely go see what Starbucks is offering,” said Antonella Mazzei as she and two colleagues emerged from a cafe two blocks away from the new Starbucks. “Anything new is welcome and good for Milan.”

Ms. Mazzei said she can imagine going to Starbucks occasionally for something special, but she can’t see herself paying €1.80 for a Starbucks espresso. Her regular bar, across from her office, sells 10 prepaid espressi for €9.

For one euro more, the new Starbucks cafe will offer a global debut, the €10 “Pantheon Blend Cream Affogato.” It’s a riff on a popular Italian dessert, made by pouring espresso over a scoop of ice cream. The Starbucks version includes ice cream made to order using liquid nitrogen. Alternatively, there will be the €10 “whiskey barrel-aged cold brew,” sweetened with vanilla syrup aged in casks.

Local bar workers are relatively sanguine about the arrival of Starbucks.

“We aren’t worried about losing business because Starbucks is offering a completely different concept,” said Marilena Muzzolini, who manages a cafe near the Starbucks. “I like Starbucks and I’ve been in Paris and London, but I don’t go there for an Italian espresso and I don’t think very many other Italians will either. You go to Starbucks for different things.”

STRÄNGNÄS, Sweden—With his gelled hair and jovial eloquence, Jimmie Akesson could have been mistaken for a talk-show host as he addressed a crowd recently in this idyllic lakeside town.

In fact, Mr. Akesson is the leader of the far-right Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in neo-Nazism that is poised to become a leading political force in Sunday’s elections. And he credits the rise to the party’s stance on crime in Sweden, which is seeing rising rates of rape and of murder involving firearms that he blames on its liberal asylum policy.

“Our questioning of mass migration and how to push back against crime—everybody is talking about that now. That’s of course in our favor,” Mr. Akesson said in an interview after his campaign appearance, which featured a big screen that flashed crime statistics and images of burning cars.

Nationalists and antiestablishment groups have flourished around Europe since a wave of refugees sparked a crisis across the continent in 2015.

But Sweden, one of the world’s most affluent and progressive nations, is poised for a particularly dramatic swing from a broad liberal consensus to extreme polarization. Polls put the Sweden Democrats in first or second place, and either outcome could leave center-left and center-right blocs struggling to form a stable government.

Sweden’s economy is growing, jobs are plentiful and the welfare system leaves no one by the wayside. And overall crime rates, while high by Western European standards, remain low, particularly when compared with the U.S.

Yet immigration has become the defining issue in the campaign, in part because many Swedes are rattled by surging violent crime in small urban enclaves populated mostly by people of foreign origin.

A shrine in Rosengard with a picture of a youth who was killed in a recent street shootout.

When President Trump declared last year that Sweden was struggling with immigration, he drew global condemnation and a social media campaign called #LastNightInSweden.

But several Swedish researchers and commentators—many from immigrant families—are now echoing his criticism, helping to erode a decadelong pro-immigration consensus.

Sweden has been taking more than five times more refugees per capita than the U.S. for over a decade, according to Joakim Ruist, an economist at the University of Gothenburg. It accepted 160,000 asylum seekers in 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis.

Today, over a fifth of Sweden’s 10 million people have foreign roots and the migrant community is often poorly integrated.

Unemployment is around 4% among native Swedes but exceeds 16% among the foreign born, and 23% for non-European immigrants, despite generous subsidies for companies that hire migrants, said Tino Sanandaji, an economist who wrote an acclaimed book on immigration policy.

Concerns about immigration have boosted support for the Sweden Democrats and pushed parties that have supported immigration to harden their rhetoric. Ulf Kristersson, leader of the center-right opposition, said its past immigration policy has been “very unsuccessful.”

The Sweden Democrats were founded in the late 1980s, and the group’s early incarnations included Swedish neo-Nazis and members of white nationalist movements.

A Changing Society Over a fifth of Sweden’s 10 million people have foreign roots, and immigration has become the defining issue in the current election campaign A girl from Somalia played in the Hjällbo district of Gothenburg, Sweden. Loulou d'Aki for The Wall Street Journal 1 of 12 • • • • •

The party renounced such ideology nearly two decades ago. The 39-year-old Mr. Akesson, who took over in 2005 and hasn’t been linked to neo-Nazism, has polished the party’s hard edges to woo centrist voters and even conservative immigrants. The party first entered parliament in 2010, with 5.7% of the vote.

Like Mr. Akesson, many pollsters credit the party’s rising support to growing fears about crime. Last year, police reported more than 320 shootings, dozens of bombings, and 7,226 rapes—a 10% increase over 2016. Norway, a nation half the size of Sweden, recorded only one gun homicide in 2017 compared with Sweden’s 43. Mr. Akesson cites data reported by Sweden’s national broadcaster showing that 58% of convicted rapists were foreigners in a recent five-year period.

Ulf Bostrom, a Gothenburg police officer, makes a point of not carrying weapons or body armor when he visits neighborhoods with large numbers of immigrants, because he believes it helps him establish a rapport with residents.

Hand grenades are being used so freely by criminal gangs that they are now cheaper than ice cream cones in high-crime neighborhoods, according to police.

The Ipsos Global Worry survey, published in July, showed that 73% of Swedes thought the country was heading in the wrong direction—the fifth worst result among 28 countries surveyed.

The gloom isn’t limited to native Swedes. Gamal El Fahl, an Egyptian refugee, says he will vote for the Sweden Democrats because of rampant crime in the Hjällbo district of Gothenburg, where he lives.

“Sweden has become dangerous since I came here 27 years ago. It will be a disaster if they accept more people from the Middle East like myself,” he said. “They are importing their values, their fanaticism.”

Hjällbo is one of 61 places in Sweden designated as “vulnerable areas” by police, because of a mix of criminality and social problems.

During the daytime, such problems are almost invisible thanks to high public spending on infrastructure and generous welfare benefits for all. But after dark, gangs rule many of these places, said Ulf Bostrom, a Gothenburg police officer.

A former weightlifter, Mr. Bostrom makes a point of not carrying weapons or body armor when he visits neighborhoods with large numbers of immigrants, because he believes it helps him establish a rapport with residents.

“Ethnic Swedes moved out of these areas over the last three decades, and a small number of criminals and religious extremists are keeping the population hostage,” he said. “Yet instead of solving problems, politicians have been saying that even discussing ethnicity and culture is racist.”

“Kids here talk about going to each other’s funerals,” said Christian Glasnovic, standing, who runs a Rosengard youth center.

Morgan Johansson, the country’s center-left justice minister, says the growing role of immigration in the political conversation is a broader European trend.

“For 25 years we have had problems with gang-related crime,” he said. “This has nothing to do with the immigration crisis of 2015.”

Yet many in Sweden don’t trust parties that have held power for decades to tackle the country’s challenges, said Patrik Ohberg, a political scientist.

In Rosengard, a district of the city of Malmö that has seen 10 murders this year, inspector Mats Svensson said children as young as 15 are being used by gangs to transport murder weapons, including Kalashnikov assault rifles.

Virtually all crime suspects—and victims—are of foreign origin, he said, yet the state has no policy to end the vicious circle. “We can’t go on like this. We need to stop mass immigration and take care of these neighborhoods before racism starts to spread together with crime.”

Christian Glasnovic, himself an immigrant, runs a Rosengard youth center. “Kids here talk about going to each other’s funerals,” he said. “Integration has failed, we are segregated. We need to reconnect the state with the people, before it’s too late.”",world

"The escalating territorial disputes in the Pacific between China and America’s allies create an ever-more-urgent need for U.S. sea power. But even as China rapidly expands and modernizes its navy, the Trump administration has not proposed enough funds to maintain America’s maritime advantage. Beginning with the coming 2019 federal budget, the president and Congress must commit to funding a full, modern fleet—or risk ceding essential U.S. and allied interests.

American sea power has secured the Pacific since the end of World War II, assuring safe and open trade, while defusing conflict throughout the region. Maintaining a powerful navy for these ends is hardly an American innovation: No great state or empire has ever retained its status without pre-eminent sea power. The histories of Athens, Venice, Spain, Holland and England show that losing control of the oceans leads ineluctably to losing great-power status.

The rapid growth and improvement of China’s naval forces is the major challenge to American sea dominance today, and likely for the foreseeable future. Retired Capt. James Fanell, former director of intelligence for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, stated in 2015 that China’s combat fleet will reach 415 ships in 2030. Beijing is particularly focused on adding submarines, amphibious vessels and small surface combatants. The buildup demonstrates China’s clear intention to dominate in coastal regions and amphibious operations—domains in which the U.S. has pre-eminence today.

As Adm. Phil Davidson, nominated to lead the U.S. Pacific Command, told the Senate in April: China “is no longer a rising power but an arrived great power and peer competitor.” He added that “China has undergone a rapid military modernization over the last three decades and is approaching parity in a number of critical areas; there is no guarantee that the United States would win a future conflict with China.”

The White House has proposed expanding the U.S. Navy to 355 ships, but its plan is too slow and underfunded. The full fleet would not be complete until 2050 at the earliest. Although President Trump proposes to dedicate $20 billion for new ship construction in 2019, and about the same in constant dollars in each of the next five years, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the project requires an additional $6.6 billion a year over the next 30 years. Without increased funding, the fleet will be smaller in three decades than it is today, and China’s navy could surpass it by 2030.

Americans would quickly see the consequences of ceding power in the Pacific. Already, China’s growing navy may soon aim to control movement around the first island chain in the East China Sea, which stretches from Japan to the Philippines.

If Beijing gains control of the region, it could hamper America’s coordination with its allies and cast doubt on the U.S. security umbrella. The White House would find it more difficult to prevent distant crises from escalating into direct threats. American business around the world, meanwhile, would be decimated. China would suddenly become the more appealing partner for trade and security. The global maritime order, which has long maintained that the East and South China Seas are international waters, would be replaced by a regional system based on “Chinese characteristics”—the euphemism by which the Chinese Communist Party refers to its brand of state control.

This is not a fait accompli; American sea power can be restored. But it will require the U.S. to decide that its status as the world’s great power is worth preserving. The Navy’s evolutionary approach to modernizing its fleet must be replaced by a revolutionary approach, increasing the current fleet’s technological advantage. And by 2035, the fleet should be expanded to no fewer than 375 ships.

The U.S. must also prepare to engage China’s navy. That means situating U.S. forces within striking distance of the East and South China Seas, with enough troops on hand to police the region effectively. It also means responding in kind to China’s existing provocations. The U.S. should bolster its military and naval support for Taiwan. The Pentagon should lean forward by actively planning to defend the entire first island chain, as well as to blockade the Southeast Asia straits, through which oil from the Middle East now flows to China.

Conflict may come sooner than most Americans imagine. This month alone, Beijing is reported to have placed anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles on three artificial islands in the South China Sea. The U.S. also recently said that American military pilots in Djibouti have been hit with lasers fired from a new Chinese base. The Pentagon has filed a diplomatic démarche requesting that China investigate, but mere diplomacy won’t suffice in the game Beijing is playing.

Timidity deters nothing. It encourages the increasing Chinese aggression. But so far America’s plans to upgrade the U.S. combat fleet have been diffident. To remain the world’s dominant maritime force, U.S. sea power will have to be trained, equipped and exercised. On this rests the future of the U.S. as a great power.

"Former President Barack Obama Friday accused President Trump of “capitalizing on resentment” and called on voters to engage in the midterm elections, which he said are “more important than any I can remember in my lifetime.”

“Just a glance at recent headlines should tell you that this moment really is different, the stakes really are higher, the consequences of any of us sitting on the sidelines are more dire,” Mr. Obama said in a speech at the University of Illinois. “This is not normal.”

Mr. Obama bridled at efforts by Mr. Trump and his allies to claim credit for the improving economy, saying it was a process begun under his presidency.

“When you hear how great the economy is doing right now, let’s just remember when this recovery started,” he said. “Suddenly Republicans are saying it’s a miracle. I have to remind them those job numbers are the same numbers as 2015 and 2016.”

Until now, Mr. Obama had withheld open criticism of Mr. Trump, keeping to a tradition of former presidents refraining from attacking their successors. In his address, he said he was stepping out “as a fellow citizen, not an ex-president” with a call to action. “I am here to deliver a simple message: You need to vote because our democracy depends on it,” he said.

Speaking at a Republican fundraiser in Fargo, N.D., President Trump said he watched Mr. Obama’s speech earlier in the day, “but I fell asleep.”

“I found that he’s very good, very good for sleeping,” Mr. Trump said, prompting laughs from the crowd. “He was trying to take credit for this incredible thing that’s happening to our country.”

Friday’s speech was the kickoff of a series of midterm campaign events by Mr. Obama, beginning Saturday with a rally in California with seven Democratic candidates in battleground House seats that the party hopes to flip from the GOP.

Mr. Obama is one of the most popular national Democrats, but Republicans say they welcome his return to the political scene, if only to give them another figure that Republicans love to hate.

“For three cycles, President Obama fired up Republicans like nobody and I’m happy if he wants to do it again,” said Rep. Steve Stivers (R., Ohio), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, at a breakfast with reporters Friday.

Mr. Obama also lambasted Republicans for refusing to stand up to Mr. Trump, and ridiculed the message of a recent New York Times op-ed from an anonymous senior administration official that some were working from within to check his more dangerous instincts and policies.

He accused Republicans of “bending over backwards to shield this behavior from scrutiny.”

Mr. Obama’s months of steering clear of national politics, while frustrating to some activists, was in keeping with the practice of his predecessor. George W. Bush took a big step back from politics after leaving the White House; the first time he stepped back in was in 2016 when he campaigned for his brother, Jeb, for president.

Last year, Mr. Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates for governor of Virginia and of New Jersey, who won their races. He has attended high-end fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee and other party groups, including a new one, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee that is focusing on funding races that will strengthen the party’s hand in redrawing congressional district lines after the 2020 census. Last month, he endorsed 81 Democrats who were running for Congress, governor and other down-ballot posts in the 2018 midterms.

But his California rally is his first on-the-stump campaigning of 2018, starting in a deep blue state that has a clutch of candidates in seven GOP-held districts that are key to Democrats’ hope of winning a House majority. After that he will go to Ohio, a state he won twice, but which Mr. Trump won in 2016.

“It’s truly exciting to welcome President Obama to Southern California,” said Gil Cisneros, one of the House candidates appearing with him at a Saturday rally in Orange County. “I welcome the opportunity to campaign alongside him and energize voters ahead of the final two months of the campaign.”

Mr. Obama will likely steer clear of red states where Mr. Trump is a GOP hero and Democratic senators are struggling for re-election—including some like Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who kept her distance from Mr. Obama when she first ran in 2012.

“Whether Barack Obama is physically there or not, red-state Democrats are going to have to be prepared to defend their votes during President Obama’s tenure,” said David Krone, who was chief of staff to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid during the Obama presidency.

In 2014, the last midterm of Mr. Obama’s presidency, he was considered a political liability to Senate Democrats in battleground states like Arkansas, Louisiana and Alaska. Incumbents were attacked for their record of voting with Mr. Obama, whose approval rating hit a low of 40% in August 2014, according to Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling. Vulnerable Democrats ran away from him, but they still lost, and the GOP gained a majority in the Senate.

Now Mr. Obama is one of the most popular national Democrats in or out of office, with 57% positive rating in the January 2017 Journal/NBC poll. Activists view him as more unifying and inspirational than congressional leaders, Nancy Pelosi in the House and Chuck Schumer in the Senate, or the party’s official chairman, Tom Perez of the Democratic National Committee.

But some Democrats worry that Mr. Obama’s emergence, and his attack on Mr. Trump, will further turn the midterm campaign into a polarized referendum on Mr. Trump instead of about policy.

“President Obama may be feeding that dynamic where it is all about President Trump,” Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said on CNN.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), responding to Mr. Obama’s speech, said it would remind voters of the problems of the Obama era, such as slower economic growth, and why they rejected Democrat Hillary Clinton as his successor.

“The more former President Obama speaks about the ‘good ol years’ of his presidency, the more likely President Trump is to get re-elected,” Mr. Graham said.

“3,000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico,” Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday. “When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3,000.”

Mr. Trump added: “This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!”

Researchers at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health, commissioned by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, in a report last month estimated there were 2,975 excess deaths in Puerto Rico from September 2017 through February 2018 stemming from last year’s hurricane. That far surpassed the original official count.

Puerto Rico’s government—led by a governor with the island’s pro-statehood party who is also a Democrat—faced criticism for nearly a year after the hurricane that it drastically undercounted the number of fatalities caused by Maria. Last month, it acknowledged in a document filed to Congress that the death toll from Maria was much higher than the official total.

The researchers estimated the number of excess deaths by analyzing death certificates and other mortality data, and comparing the number of deaths during the designated period with past mortality patterns. They calculated the total number of deaths in the period was 22% higher than the number of fatalities that would have been expected, the researchers said.

In analyzing Puerto Rico’s death-certification process, the study found that listed causes of death included cardiac arrest, respiratory failure and septicemia. But researchers concluded that such causes were sometimes misassigned, with physicians failing to link the deaths to the hurricane.

The Milken Institute School of Public Health, which conducted the study, on Thursday issued a statement saying it stood by the science of its report, which it said was “carried out with complete independence and freedom from any kind of interference.”

Mr. Rosselló responded to Mr. Trump’s tweet by reiterating his administration’s confidence in the George Washington University study and its estimated death count.

“The victims and the people of Puerto Rico do not deserve to have their pain questioned,” Mr. Rosselló said. “They deserve recognition of that impact by our president…We strongly denounce anyone who would use this disaster or question our suffering for political purposes.”

Mr. Rosselló also asked Mr. Trump to ensure that federal agencies invest the necessary resources to help the island recover.

The Trump administration faced criticism for its relief efforts in Puerto Rico from lawmakers in both parties, who have said the White House was too slow to respond in the wake of the hurricane and didn’t send enough people to the island to rebuild infrastructure and speed medical supplies, food and water to communities there.

Weeks before Maria hit, Puerto Rico’s electricity grid had been hit hard when Hurricane Irma passed off the island’s north coast, knocking out power for more than 1 million people. Thousands who lost power during Irma never had it restored before Maria hit.

Puerto Rico didn’t restore power to many parts of the island until last month, meaning some residents on the island lacked power for nearly a year after the hurricane.

San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruztweeted to the president on Thursday: “Shame on you,” including a picture of his tweet. She added: “Damn it: this is NOT about politics this was always about SAVING LIVES.”

Lawmakers in both parties on Thursday criticized the president’s tweet, with some casting blame on the federal government’s relief efforts for the high death toll. “You’re right, Mr. President,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) said in a tweet. “The hurricane didn’t kill 3,000 people. Your botched response did.”

“Casualties don’t make a person look bad,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said of the president’s tweets, adding that he visited the island and he believes the analysis done on the death toll.

“I have no reason to dispute those numbers. Those are just the facts when a horrible hurricane hits an isolated island,” he said.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a staunch ally of the president who is running for Senate, tweeted: “I disagree with @POTUS—an independent study said thousands were lost and Gov. Rosselló agreed.” He added: “The extent of lives lost as a result of Maria is heart wrenching.” And Rep. Ron DeSantis, who won the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Florida with Mr. Trump’s endorsement, issued a statement saying “he doesn’t believe any loss of life has been inflated.”

Nearly 12 hours after Mr. Trump’s tweets, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley issued a statement praising the administration’s “unprecedented support” for Puerto Rico. Mr. Gidley said the president’s tweets were “responding to the liberal media and the San Juan mayor, who sadly have tried to exploit the devastation by pushing out a constant stream of misinformation and false accusations.”

Ms. Yulín Cruz had criticized Mr. Trump’s comments earlier in the week describing his administration’s response in Puerto Rico as a “success.” On Tuesday, she tweeted: “Can you imagine what he thinks failure looks like?”

Last month, following the release of the report, the White House released a statement from press secretary Sarah Sanders saying the government “has been, and will continue to be, supportive of Mr. Rosselló’s efforts to ensure a full accountability and transparency of fatalities resulting from last year’s hurricanes.”

A report earlier this month by the Government Accountability Office described the government as “down to the bottom of the barrel” in staffing by the time Maria hit Puerto Rico, citing a series of other hurricanes and catastrophic wildfires last year that overwhelmed federal disaster responders. The report said the GAO has a number of audits pending that will analyze issues such as the restoration of power in Puerto Rico.

Mr. Trump earlier this week described his administration’s efforts in Puerto Rico as an “unsung success.”

The researchers pointed to several problems in the death-certification process that contributed to the island government’s initial undercounting of fatalities. Among them were a lack of training for physicians on how to certify deaths after a natural disaster and the government’s lack of communication about proper death-certificate reporting before the 2017 hurricane season.

Mr. Trump’s tweets Thursday came as Hurricane Florencehurtles toward the East Coast. The president, whose calendar has been cleared for the day in light of the coming storm, spent the morning tweeting attacks on the JP Morgan Chase & Co. chief executive and complaining about the Russia investigation.

Of Florence, he warned: “Be careful!”

"The White House said Iranian-backed militias in Iraq had carried out “life-threatening attacks” against the U.S. consulate in Basra and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and warned Washington would hold Tehran responsible if there are future assaults.

“The United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to United States government facilities,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday. “America will respond swiftly and decisively in defense of American lives.”

The statement followed an attack on Saturday in which several rockets were fired at the Basra airport, where the U.S. consulate is located.

At least one rocket also was fired at the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad, where the U.S. Embassy is based, and mortar fire also struck the Green Zone earlier in the week. No Americans were injured and no U.S. property was hit in the attacks.

U.S. officials haven’t made public any evidence that Iran ordered the attacks, and some U.S. officials said the Shiite militias may have been acting on their own. But the White House statement faults Iran for failing to stop the attacks, which it alleges were carried out by proxies Tehran has armed, trained and financed.

The rocket attack in Basra followed accusations by Abu Medhi al-Mohandis, a Shiite militia commander who U.S. officials say has long been supported by Iran, that the U.S. was responsible for demonstrations in which the Iranian consulate in the city was stormed and set on fire and the offices of most political parties, including Iranian-backed paramilitary groups, were destroyed.

“The American Embassy is directing the situation in Basra,” said Mr. Mohandis, who the U.S. has designated a terrorist for his role in the bombing of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in the 1980s.

While some initial news reports suggested that the Basra airport was the target of the rocket fire, one U.S. official said it is clear that the real objective was the U.S. diplomatic mission there.

“Given the explicit incitement in social media,” the official said, “the U.S. government has no doubt that this was directed at the U.S.”

Iran trained and armed Shiite militias that attacked U.S. troops during the Iraq war—a role that was confirmed by newly declassified interrogation reports of a prominent Shiite figure.

But Iran and the U.S. have had a truce of sorts since U.S. forces returned to Iraq in 2014 to help the Iraqis fight Islamic State militants. Until last week, Shiite militias have refrained from attacks on U.S. forces or diplomats.

U.S. officials described some of the weapons used in the recent attacks as relatively primitive when compared with more advanced roadside bombs, the so-called Explosively Formed Penetrators, and other weapons that Iran provided to Shiite militias during the Iraq war.

"Arizona and Florida have contested primaries for both parties Tuesday, while Oklahoma Republicans will choose a candidate for governor in the deep red state. The marquee Republican contests are tests of loyalty to President Trump, as GOP voters in Florida pick a candidate for governor and Arizona Republicans for Senate. And in Florida and Arizona, Democrats have competitive contests for governor.

Here’s what to watch Tuesday:

Florida: A Trump test in the East

The Florida GOP gubernatorial primary has Mr. Trump’s fingerprints all over it. Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, a well-funded Republican backed by the state party establishment, had been the clear front runner for months.

Then Mr. Trump weighed in and endorsed his rival, GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis. That catapulted the congressman to a double-digit lead in most polls.

If Mr. DeSantis wins, it will be a measure of what works in the Trump GOP, and how it has changed from the pre-Trump GOP.

Mr. DeSantis is a Fox News celebrity (appearing 93 times in less than a year, more than any other elected official), a member of the House’s hard-line Freedom Caucus, and relentless cheerleader for the president. Mr. Putnam has a blue chip resume of government service and political success, and he has out-raised and out-organized his rival.

All polls point to a DeSantis victory, though some surveys showed the race was getting close as primary day approached. If Mr. Putnam pulls out a come-from-behind victory, it will be a blow to Mr. Trump’s political prestige.

Arizona: A Trump fest in the West

A three-way race for Arizona’s Republican Senate nomination has, like GOP contests elsewhere, evolved into a Trump loyalty test. All three candidates promise to “Make America Great Again.” One local columnist called them the “MAGA triplets.”

The Senate primary election pits the establishment favorite, Rep. Martha McSally, who is backed by the Chamber of Commerce and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, against two lesser-funded rivals who are aiming to appeal to the party’s far-right wing.

Polls suggest Ms. McSally is most likely to beat former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who spent her last weekend accusing Sen. John McCain of ending his cancer treatment to stunt her political progress. Mr. McCain died on Saturday. Ms. McSally is also favored over former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who last year received a pardon from Mr. Trump. Mr. Arpaio had been convicted of contempt of court after disobeying a federal court order to halt immigration raids. Mr. Trump hasn’t endorsed anyone in the race.

Ms. McSally kept her distance from Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and has refused to say whether she voted for him. In her Senate campaign, she has portrayed herself as a loyal Trump ally, a move that is a testament to the president’s popularity among GOP primary voters.

That could make it harder for the GOP nominee to tack to the center against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who, in the absence of a serious primary challenge, has spent the last 18 months fundraising. She has collected $10.7 million to Ms. McSally’s $7.7 million.

Ms. Ward has raised $3 million and Mr. Arpaio just $1.3 million.

Another left vs. center battle in Florida

Democrats have been consistent in 2018 primaries. When given comparable options, they choose women over men, and in toss-up races, the mainstream candidates have beaten those aligned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a liberal independent.

Those trends augur good things for former Rep. Gwen Graham, who is the polling leader in Florida’s Democratic primary for governor. Close behind her are two mayors: Philip Levine of Miami Beach and Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee.

Ms. Graham is campaigning as a steward of her father’s political legacy. Bob Graham, the former governor and senator, was a fixture in the state, serving in elected statewide office from 1979 to 2005. The younger Graham features her father in many of her TV advertisements.

Mr. Levine, who grew wealthy through cruise-ship marketing companies, has spent $22 million of his own funds to back his campaign. He has run as a staunch advocate for stricter gun-control regulations.

Mr. Gillum has tied himself to the party’s Sanders wing. His final TV ad of the race flashes on the screen an array of slogans including “healthcare for all,” “ban assault weapons,” “abolish & replace ICE,” and “impeach Trump,” which would be well beyond the purview of Florida’s statehouse.

Also running are billionaire Palm Beach investor Jeff Greene, who self-financed his $30 million campaign, and Chris King, the CEO of an Orlando real estate firm.

There are 36 governors' races this year. Republicans will have to defend 26 of them and Democrats nine. And there is one independent governor. The WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why these races should be getting more attention. Photo: Getty

Don’t call it a comeback

Two former Democratic members of Congress—Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona and Alan Grayson of Florida—are trying to return to Washington but under very different circumstances.

Ms. Kirkpatrick, a former gun-rights champion, has reinvented herself as a gun-control advocate and is the front-runner for the southern Arizona House seat once held by Gabrielle Giffords.

She faces Matt Heinz, a physician who is making his third run for Congress. Mr. Heinz has tried holding Ms. Kirkpatrick’s NRA-friendly past against her, but he’s been vastly outspent by Ms. Kirkpatrick and her allies with EMILY’S List.

The seat is being vacated by Ms. McSally, the GOP front runner in the Senate primary. The winner of Tuesday’s Democratic primary will likely face Republican Lea Marquez Peterson, the head of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The Cook Political Report rates the seat, which backed Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump in 2016, as “lean Democratic.”

Mr. Grayson, meanwhile, is trying to win back his safely Democratic seat from Rep. Darren Soto, who won it in 2016 when Mr. Grayson ran for Senate and lost in the primary by 40 percentage points.

Few in Florida’s political class are thrilled to see Mr. Grayson’s return, but his brand of populist Democratic politics has proven popular in the Orlando-area district in the past.

Oklahoma: the latest battle of outsider vs. experience

Oklahoma will be the latest test of an outsider message for Republican primary voters as they pick a candidate for governor.

Former Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett faces mortgage executive Kevin Stitt in a primary runoff that has split over whether voters want a candidate with political experience. Mr. Trump hasn’t endorsed either man in the race.

Mr. Cornett touted his tenure leading the state’s largest city while blasting Mr. Stitt for running a business whose Georgia license was revoked by state regulators and who hadn’t voted in past GOP primaries.

Mr. Stitt, in his TV advertising, accused Mr. Cornett of being insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump. Mr. Stitt says in his ads that he will “help President Trump build the wall,” even though such a wall would be hundreds of miles from Oklahoma.

Mr. Cornett responded with a memorable ad calling Mr. Stitt’s attacks “Bull Stitt.”

The winner will be a heavy favorite against Democratic nominee Drew Edmondson, a former state attorney general.

"PERAST, Montenegro—Vladimir Milinović has seen Western tourism in his Balkan village swell so much, he now knows who is likely to tip, and who will try to haggle down the €5 (nearly $6) he charges for a short boat ride.

“We like Americans because they are very generous,” said Mr. Milinović, as he navigated his motorboat to a picturesque island near the village called Our Lady of the Rocks. “If somebody tries to get a cheaper price we know they are probably French.”

So many tourists are descending on Europe this summer—drawn in part by the strong dollar—that a growing number are looking beyond the continent’s famous destinations, leaving hardly a spot on the map unvisited. As the lines stretch longer outside Notre-Dame in Paris, and the crush gets greater on Saint Mark’s Square in Venice, even tiny Montenegro is enjoying its place in the sun.

In well-trodden Europe, you can’t get much more off the beaten track than this Balkan country smaller than Connecticut, whose pristine beaches and landscape were relatively obscure until recently.

Conditions could hardly be better for Europe, which takes the lion’s share of global tourism revenues globally. The rising dollar and strong U.S. economy are drawing more Americans here. Russians have begun to travel again in Europe, especially in the Balkans, after a hiatus for Russia’s economic downturn. And the growing number of Chinese who visit Europe are staying longer, venturing beyond whistle-stop tours to delve more deeply into the continent’s culture offerings.

Sheep graze in a field near the village of Njegusi, Montenegro. Photo: marko djurica/Reuters

International overnight stays in Europe rose 7% in the first four months of 2018 compared with the same period last year, building on what the United Nations’ tourism organization called a “remarkable” 8% increase in 2017. Above all, Europe’s continuing economic upswing has led to strongly rising tourism within the continent, especially from Germany. Tourism industry executives expect the good times to continue.

The sector’s boom began several years ago, spurred by Europe’s emergence from its financial crisis, and has proved largely impervious to Europe’s other woes, from the migration crisis to terrorism.

With Europe remaining one of the world’s safest and most politically stable regions, destinations such as Spain and Greece have benefited from people’s security fears about vacationing in the Middle East and North Africa. Even European cities that suffered terrorist attacks in recent years, such as Paris in 2015 and Brussels in 2016, saw temporary dips in tourism before bouncing back within about a year and joining the wider boom.

The trend of tourists seeking out locations that were once considered second tier is evident even in Spain, whose 82 million foreign guests in 2017 made it the world’s second-most visited country after France. In the first half of this year, foreign tourists in Spain’s 11 least-visited regions, including the Basque Country, were about one-third higher than in the same period in 2016, while visitors to Andalusia and the Canary Islands, two of the country’s top destinations, were up a more modest 12% and 7%, respectively, in that time.

The town of Cetinje in Montenegro Photo: marko djurica/Reuters

The boom is bringing back fond memories for Montenegro. It was a popular destination for Yugoslavs, but it didn’t see many foreign guests for a long time after Communism fell. Last year, 1 million tourists visited this country of 650,000 inhabitants, according to the national statistics office, a 19% rise from the year before. In the first four months of 2018, numbers were up another 20% on the year.

Tourism generated about €1 billion for Montenegro in 2017, a third of the country’s gross domestic product. In Europe, only Croatia has faster tourism growth.

Caleb Wang, a 20-year-old history student at the University of Chicago, said it never would have even occurred to him to visit Montenegro. But he ended up in the medieval town of Kotor, near Perast, on a cruise with his parents that left from Venice and followed the Croatian and Montenegrin coasts.

“I’d heard Croatia was beautiful, but I didn’t expect Montenegro would be this nice,” said Mr. Wang. “You can see why tourism is booming here.”

Montenegro is scrambling to build and refurbish hotels and improve its roads. Kotor plans to renovate the 1,350 stone steps, many in a parlous state, that lead steeply up to its formidable fortress.

The only road through Kotor, a Unesco World Heritage site with about 2,500 inhabitants that gets up to 15,000 tourists a day in high summer, is often jammed with traffic. On a recent sunny day, the old town was awash with visitors from a cruise ship.

When the first cruise ship docked at Kotor just over a decade ago, the town celebrated, and the event made the national evening television news. Now an average of a ship a day stops here. One day this August, four ships queued for a berth.

“People ask me what’s wrong if there isn’t a tour ship docked,” said Ana Nives Radović, the town’s tourism director. “The number of tourists here is still acceptable,” she said. But if there is another decade of such growth, “it might start getting out of hand.”

"Does President Trump care if Republicans lose the House of Representatives this November? If that seems like an odd question, consider that Mr. Trump is running a campaign strategy that puts the House at maximum risk while focusing on the Senate. The latest evidence is Mr. Trump’s threat to shut down the government in September if he doesn’t get money for his border wall.

"WASHINGTON—The U.S. threatened to slap sanctions on countries that don’t cut oil imports from Iran to “zero” by Nov. 4, part of the Trump administration’s push to further isolate Tehran both politically and economically, a senior U.S. State Department official said.

Buyers of Iranian crude had expected the U.S. would allow them time to reduce their oil imports over a much longer period, by issuing sanctions waivers for nations that made significant efforts to cut their purchases. That expectation was partly based on previous comments from top Trump officials, as well as the Obama administration’s earlier effort to wean the world off Iranian oil over several years.

But the senior State Department official said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s administration doesn’t plan to issue any waivers and would instead be asking other Middle Eastern crude exporters over the coming days to ensure oil supply to global markets.

The tactic is likely to further escalate geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and other nations as the Trump administration pits itself against its allies and other major economies over its nearly unilateral policy toward Iran and a host of challenges on trade.

Oil prices immediately jumped on the news, with West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery ending 3.6% higher at $70.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That marked the highest level since May, when the White House said it would pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear accord—which the U.S. and other major countries reached with Tehran to curb its nuclear development—and would reimpose crushing sanctions on one of the world’s largest oil suppliers.

“We will certainly be requesting that their oil imports go to zero without question by Nov. 4th,” the official said of other countries’ purchases of Iranian oil. While the administration won’t rule out issuing sanctions waivers in the future, the official said, its predisposition is: “No, we’re not going to do waivers.”

“We view this as one of our top national-security priorities,” the official said.

The move is likely designed to spur greater global compliance with U.S. sanctions. Most major importers of Iranian crude have balked at Washington’s new economic offensive against Tehran.

Two weeks ago, Andrew Peek, deputy assistant secretary of State for Iran and Iraq, said the U.S. was prepared to issue waivers if countries made major reductions in Iran oil imports. “It needs to be significant but will probably vary from country to country,” he said then.

Top administration officials from the State and Treasury departments have jetted around the world in recent days to persuade other countries to cut use of Iranian crude and warn them that any companies, banks or traders that handle Iranian oil face U.S. penalties, including the risk of being frozen out of U.S. markets. The senior State Department official said allies in Europe and Asia already had been warned, and trips to China, India and Turkey were in the works.

Governments are being cautioned that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the White House “aren’t kidding about this,” the official said. China and India, two of the largest buyers of Iranian crude, “will be subject to the same sanctions that everybody else is if they engage in those sectors of the economy.”

The Trump administration, in pulling out of the nuclear accord and reimposing economywide sanctions on Iran that hit not just the oil sector, but also the banking, shipping, trade and insurance markets, said it wants to force Tehran to radically overhaul its nuclear and military posture in the region.

Banks’ reluctance to deal with Iran is already taking its toll on Tehran’s oil exports. Exports have fallen to an average of 2.2 million barrels a day this month, compared with 2.7 million barrels a day in May, according to data from London-based consulting firm Vortexa. Earlier this month, Indian Oil Corp. , the country’s largest refiner, said it was considering cutting Iran crude imports after a decision by government-run State Bank of India to stop dealing with Tehran.

European refiners, which buy around a third of Iran’s oil exports, are also dropping out. Italy’s Saras is considering no longer buying Iranian oil because its banks don’t want to finance such trades even before the Nov. 4 deadline, according to company officials. The company said last week it had made no final decision. European refiners say they have already started buying more oil from Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iraq to make up for upcoming reductions in Iranian oil.

Meanwhile, economic woes have triggered a new round of protests in Iran, posing a challenge to President Hassan Rouhani’s government as it struggles to tackle persistent double-digit inflation and unemployment. Economic concerns in the country have been aggravated by the Trump administration’s exit from the 2015 nuclear accord.

Mr. Pompeo warned last month that Tehran would face “the strongest sanctions in history” if it didn’t yield to U.S. demands that it temper its nuclear and regional ambitions. He also suggested the Iranian public could take matters into its own hands.

The administration’s more aggressive stance on sanctions could bolster its leverage over Tehran, but it also complicates the White House’s other diplomatic and political priorities.

The move puts particular pressure on major trans-Atlantic allies that import hefty amounts of crude from Iran at a time when Mr. Trump is ratcheting up tensions with European nations over trade and seeking their support for his North Korea pressure campaign and other foreign-policy goals.

European officials said in recent weeks they expected oil imports would have to start gradually falling after the November deadline, giving them time to explore how to keep Iran in the nuclear deal and prevent it from resuming its nuclear activities.

Tuesday’s announcement could deflate those hopes. “This is really unhelpful and part of an escalation plan. We strongly disagree with this plan,” a senior European diplomat said.

Many in Europe had been hoping the administration might continue the Obama-era practice of giving sanction waivers for 20% reductions in imports.

Another senior European official cautioned that the U.S. policy may turn out to be more bark than bite, particularly as Washington will likely struggle to persuade other countries to accede to their demands on such a sensitive issue as energy imports. “They will not succeed,” the person said.

Separately, European officials have said they would try to maintain banking channels to ensure continued trade and investment, including energy imports, though many analysts question whether they will be able to do so.

In Asia, the U.S. is relying on China to help it keep pressure on North Korea by cutting the financial and economic ties vital to Pyongyang. Some analysts say China’s government will likely keep importing Iranian crude, banking on Washington’s desire for its cooperation on North Korea.

And as the administration’s Iran policy risks pushing up oil prices as the U.S. heads into elections this year, the White House could face its own domestic political backlash.

The more aggressive policy could push oil prices past $85 a barrel by the third quarter of the year, said Frank Verrastro, a top energy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

While oil from other suppliers can fit the refining specifications set for Iranian crude and Russia and other major producers have signaled they will increase output, other production squeezes could exacerbate the upward price pressure sanctions are putting on markets.

Mr. Verrastro said the International Energy Agency was too optimistic in its recent estimate that the world has around 3.5 million barrels a day of spare production capacity that could offset Iran’s 2.4 million in daily exports. That assumes nearly all of the spare capacity currently offline in Saudi Arabia and other major exporters could come back online and run smoothly, he said, noting that hurricanes, labor strikes, technical problems and political turmoil often tighten the spigot on global oil supplies.

“I would guess they reassess in November, when prices are rising heading into the election season,” Mr. Verrastro said.

"OTTAWA—Tim Keenan is making plans to pass along his fifth-generation Quebec dairy business to his children, more than two decades after buying it from his father. There is one complicating factor: Trade talks between the U.S. and Canada threaten to upend the industry.

Canadian dairy farmers depend on a nearly 50-year-old system for protecting domestic production. The protections are viewed as sacrosanct by the main political parties, which have historically feared losing rural votes in Quebec and Ontario, the two biggest provinces and home to nearly all of Canada’s 10,500 dairy farms.

There are signs that is starting to change.

President Trump has called Canada’s dairy protections a “disgrace,” and his top aides warn they are now an obstacle in reaching a deal on a revised North American Free Trade Agreement before a late September deadline. The president has taken aim at Canada’s high tariffs on some foreign dairy products, ranging from 200% to 300%, which kick in if import volumes surpass quota thresholds.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has vowed to defend the dairy protections, known here as supply management. He has also hinted at concessions, a potentially high-stakes move for a leader facing a tight election race in just over a year.

“Is there room for flexibility? I mean, we will see and that depends on the kinds of negotiations that we have,” Mr. Trudeau said earlier this month.

Canadians appear amenable to this approach, with certain caveats. An Angus Reid Institute poll last year showed most Canadians are open to discussing changes to dairy policy, and an August poll indicated Canadians are split on terminating the regime altogether, but would lean toward this option if farmers are fairly compensated.

Canada has made concessions before. It agreed to give other Pacific Rim nations access equal to 3.25% of its annual milk production in this year’s Trans-Pacific Partnership deal. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the trade pact in 2017. Separately, Canada’s trade deal with the European Union in 2016 allows for a doubling of European cheese exports, equal to more than 4% of the Canadian market, but left intact the supply-management system.

Canada’s dairy industry is worth six billion Canadian dollars ($4.62 billion) in farm sales and another C$15 billion at the food-processing level, according to the Canadian government. Overall, that is a fraction of Canada’s C$1.8 trillion economy.

And the number of dairy farms in Canada has declined sharply over the past decade, to more than 10,000 from nearly 20,000 at the turn of the century. For context, the state of Wisconsin has almost as many dairy farms as all of Canada.

Yet dairy tends to get a disproportionate focus from politicians. The protections tend to pit a well-organized dairy lobby in Ottawa and provincial capitals versus think tanks and maverick politicians who believe the system has outlived its usefulness.

“There are very few dairy farmers left, but the image, for politicians, is one of big numbers still,” said Martha Hall Findlay, a former Canadian Liberal lawmaker and now head of the Canada West Foundation think tank. She has become an outspoken critic of the dairy system, arguing it stifles competition and forces consumers to pay higher prices for staples like milk and butter.

Under the regime, the country limits the production of dairy products by distributing quotas, which dictate how much farmers are allowed to sell domestically and sets fixed prices for farm sales. The goal, proponents say, is to avoid overproduction and the wild price fluctuations that often hit other commodities. The system also imposes tariffs on dairy imports above specific thresholds to limit foreign competition.

After the U.S. and Mexico announced a trade deal, Canada and the U.S. resumed efforts to come to an agreement. WSJ's Shelby Holliday looks at some sticking points.

Bruce Muirhead, an expert on Canada’s supply-management system and a history professor at the University of Waterloo, said the limits have helped stabilize the market and kept farmers here from contributing to a global dairy glut.

“We are not part of the problem, in fact we are part of the solution to the whole issue of oversupply,” Mr. Muirhead said. U.S. farmers are struggling, he said, because they produce too much dairy, not because their access to Canada’s market is limited.

A price difference can be seen at retailers on either side of the Niagara River. Big Baspa Mini Mart in Buffalo, New York, sells milk at $1.99 a quart. Stanley Variety in Niagara Falls, Ontario, sells a liter of milk—which is slightly larger than a quart—for C$2.99, or $2.30.

A spokeswoman for the Dairy Farmers of Canada, a lobby group, said it is unclear what concessions Canada is considering in the Nafta talks. The group contends concessions made in recent trade deals threaten to cost the industry up to C$350 million in lost sales.

Mr. Keenan, the dairy farmer, said he is watching Nafta talks closely, with an eye toward what they might mean for the family farm. Canada’s dairy system, he said, has allowed his family to plan for the future because they know what their incomes will be each year.

“It depends how much borders are opened up” in the talks, he said. “Certainly it will impact our bottom line, and the future of the dairy industry.”

"New York Republicans on Thursday tapped political newcomer and Manhattan attorney Keith Wofford as their candidate for state attorney general at the party’s nominating convention.

The Republican candidate is running for the position formerly held by Eric Schneiderman, the state’s former top legal officer who resigned earlier this month following allegations of assault, which he denies.

Mr. Wofford, the first African-American Republican nominee for attorney general, is considered the underdog in the general election matchup. Republicans have failed to win a statewide race since 2002, and the last GOP attorney general left office in 1998. Democrats also expect a big turnout with their base eager to voice displeasure with President Donald Trump.

“Voters are going to recognize that any machine candidate will lack credibility to clean up collusion and corruption in the government,” said Mr. Wofford, who has never run for public office, in an interview. “It’s not about party affiliation. It’s about who can do the job.”

Republicans said Mr. Schneiderman’s scandal presents the party with a rare opportunity for a statewide win.

“Three weeks ago the political world was shocked by the news of disgraced Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s resignation,” said Nicholas Langworthy, chairman of the Erie County Republican Party. “It was a celebratory day in the Republican Party.”

Mr. Wofford beat out a crowded field of candidates for the GOP nod, including Thomas Humbach, an attorney from Rockland County; and Randy Elf, an attorney from Chautauqua County. But his closest rival was Joe Holland, an attorney and a minister who grew up in Auburn, N.Y.

Mr. Holland, who received 33% of the Republican delegate votes to Mr. Wofford’s 63%, endorsed his rival and declined to challenge him in a primary.

“This is a time for our party to unify,” Mr. Holland said.

New York Democrats on Wednesday nominated New York City Public Advocate Letitia James as their candidate for attorney general, who is the favorite to win the general election in November in the Democratic-dominated state.

When asked for comment on Mr. Wofford’s nomination, Geoff Berman, the executive director of the New York Democratic Party, said “Who?”

“Tish James, who was my neighborhood city councilwoman in Brooklyn and is a great public advocate for New York City, will be an outstanding attorney general for New York State,” Mr. Berman said.

Zephyr Teachout, a law professor and former gubernatorial candidate who lost the 2014 primary to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and Leecia Eve, a Verizon executive, have also said they would petition for a spot on the Democratic primary ballot.

Mr. Wofford, a Buffalo, N.Y., native, earned his bachelor’s degree from Harvard College and his law degree from Harvard Law School. He is co-managing partner at law firm Ropes & Gray.

At the convention, Republicans railed against political corruption in Albany and said Mr. Wofford is well equipped to take that on.

“For too long New Yorkers have been fleeced by bad politicians in Albany,” said Broome County Republican Chairman Bijoy Datta. “It has to end.”

Fundraising will be a challenge for Mr. Wofford, who is still assembling a campaign staff and beginning the fundraising process. Mr. Schneiderman had raised nearly $7 million by July 2014 during his last election run.

“Based on my conversations, I expect good support from folks around the state who want to see better, cheaper and more honest government for the taxpayers of New York,” Mr. Wofford said.

"Pierz, Minn.

Amid a parade of firetrucks, Model Ts and Shriners driving go-karts, Pete Stauber is running—literally—for Congress. As the procession rolls through this town of 1,350 during Pierz Oktoberfest (held, naturally, at the end of August), Mr. Stauber, 52, has to jog to keep up. That’s because he so frequently stops to shake a hand, to explain he’s the Republican candidate in the Eighth Congressional District, and to add that he hopes he has your vote.

The final finish line on Nov. 6 is weeks away, but Mr. Stauber appears in good political shape given that Northeast Minnesota is historically Democratic territory. The Eighth District includes the Great Lakes’ busiest port, Duluth, as well as the state’s Iron Range, where thousands still work mining and processing taconite ore. In 70 years, the GOP candidate has won here only once.

What may change that is Donald Trump. The district’s center of gravity has shifted slightly in recent decades, as Duluth lost population and the Twin Cities suburbs crawled further up the map. Still, Northeast Minnesota went for Mr. Trump by 16 points in 2016 after President Obama won it by 6 in 2012, one of the largest swings in the country.

Now the president’s blue-collar appeal is helping make the congressional seat competitive, at least for a certain kind of Republican. Mr. Stauber, a retired Duluth police officer, was at one point the president of his union, Local 363, and he opposes right-to-work laws. He backs President Trump’s 25% steel tariffs to the hilt. “The Chinese steel dumping should have been dealt with decades ago,” he says. “It devastated our Iron Range and our mining industry.” The splash photo on Mr. Stauber’s website shows him riding with Mr. Trump in “The Beast,” the presidential limo, before a June rally in Duluth attended by 8,000.

When Mr. Stauber jumped into the race last summer, he expected to face an incumbent Democrat, Rep. Rick Nolan. Then in February the congressman announced he would retire. Instead the Democratic candidate is Joe Radinovich, 32, a onetime state lawmaker who managed Mr. Nolan’s last campaign and worked as the Minneapolis mayor’s chief of staff.

One point of contention, splitting Democrats, is a pair of proposals to mine copper and nickel in Superior National Forest. The Obama administration, in its waning days, moved to block mining within about 365 square miles. “It was purely political,” Mr. Stauber says, “and it was the biggest assault on our way of life.” When President Trump came to town, he pledged to reverse the ban. Mr. Radinovich, who defeated explicitly antimining Democrats in the primary, has said he thinks the work can go on without hurting the environment. But he seems much more comfortable talking up Medicare for all.

A poll this week puts Mr. Radinovich in the lead, 44% to 43%, well within the margin of error. Politics aside, Mr. Stauber has a compelling story: He once played minor-league hockey and then minded four kids while his wife deployed to Iraq with the Air National Guard. If any part of blue Minnesota is open to a Trump Republican, it’s the Iron Range..

In the state as a whole, however, Mr. Trump’s approval since Inauguration Day has dropped 17 points. This is a problem for Republicans in places like the Second District, anchored in the suburbs south of the Twin Cities. Though it’s a somewhat purple area, Republicans had held the seat tightly since 2002. The GOP contender in 2016, Jason Lewis, was expected to flame out, given incendiary comments from his 20-year career in talk radio. Critics dubbed him “mini-Trump.” He won by 1.8 points. But that year’s ballot also featured a perennial candidate on the populist left, running under the Independence Party, who took 8%.

Mr. Lewis has worked to build a legislative record. He wrote bipartisan bills on criminal-justice reform and is pushing a legislative amendment to force the Twin Cities’ regional government, the appointed Metropolitan Council, to have at least one elected member. “They’re raising taxes and spending all their money on very expensive light-rail lines,” Mr. Lewis says. “We don’t have the density for that sort of transit, and yet what suffers is roads in the Second District.” He defends a disputed plan to replace parts of the Enbridge Pipeline, which feeds oil to the state’s largest refinery: “I think it’s good policy. I think it’s safer than truck or rail, so I’m all in favor of it.”

Yet old tape from his talk-radio days continues to surface. In July, CNN posted a clip from 2012. “It used to be that women were held to a little bit of a higher standard,” Mr. Lewis mused. “Now are we beyond those days, where a woman can behave as a slut, but you can’t call her a slut?” Last month BuzzFeed quoted a 2013 show on which Mr. Lewis argued that if courts ruled gay marriage to be covered by the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, it would “undo the entire state criminal code”—because, among other examples, “when we pass a law against rape, you’re not treating a rapist equal.”

Mr. Lewis’s stock defense is that he was paid to be provocative. He insists such comments don’t reflect the Jason Lewis voters recall listening to all those years. Is more tape forthcoming? “Who knows?” he says. “Personally, I don’t care, because I don’t think it’s going to work. It’s too clever by half. But who knows who’s got what?” Radio stations, he explains, don’t keep long archives, and neither does he. “Once you leave their employment—zzzip—they erase it. So I don’t have the show,” he says. “You realize how much server space I’d have to have for 20 years of radio?”

The Democratic candidate, Angie Craig, is the same one Mr. Lewis beat in 2016. A former HR executive at a company that made pacemakers, she was raised in Arkansas and still has a hint of Southern accent. So far, her soft-focus ads center on family life with her wife and four sons. And if, as November nears, the Democrats want to talk about talk radio?

Mr. Lewis is defiant. “I’d rather talk about Enbridge Pipeline, about the Met Council, about a rising tide of economic growth,” he says. “If they want to dig up old radio clips, and they think they can win a congressional seat that way, let ’em do it.”

"NEW BERN, N.C.—Florence continued to drench the Carolinas Saturday as it lumbered across the region, claiming at least six lives and stranding hundreds of people in floodwaters.

The storm, which made landfall near Wrightsville Beach, N.C., on Friday morning, moved at a 2-mile-an-hour crawl over eastern South Carolina on Saturday, producing severe flooding, according to the National Hurricane Center. It is forecast to soak the Carolinas throughout the weekend, dumping as much as 40 inches of rain along the coast south of Cape Hatteras. The deluge triggered “catastrophic flash flooding” and significant river flooding, the hurricane center said.

At least six people have died in storm conditions in the region, according to authorities. In North Carolina, the deaths include two people killed in Lenoir County, and a mother and infant killed in Wilmington, N.C., when a tree fell on a home, according to authorities. A woman in Pender County also died when a fallen tree prevented emergency crews from reaching her while she suffered a heart attack, a county spokeswoman said.

‘The rainfall is epic, and will continue to be. We face walls of water, at our coast, along our rivers, across farmland, in our cities and in our towns.’ —North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper

The first storm-related death reported in South Carolina occurred Friday night, when a 61-year-old woman driving on a highway near Union crashed into a toppled tree.

More than 810,000 people lacked power in North Carolina, and another 170,000 outages were reported in South Carolina, according to emergency-management agencies. More than 28,000 people were staying in 220 shelters in the Carolinas.

“The rainfall is epic, and will continue to be,” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper at a news conference Saturday morning. “We face walls of water, at our coast, along our rivers, across farmland, in our cities and in our towns.”

Mr. Cooper said dangers from flooding were increasing, with some rivers not expected to crest until early next week. “The water is rising fast everywhere, even in places that don’t typically flood,” he said. “Many people who think that the storm has missed them have yet to see its threat.”

James Trogdon, the state’s transportation secretary, said numerous counties had primary roads closed, and portions of interstate highways were shut. Interstate 40 was closed north of Wilmington, as was Interstate 95 near Fayetteville, because of flooding.

Federal officials said Saturday that while Florence had weakened, its dangers had not. “What we’re dealing with here is a major flooding and rain event. At this point, we’re also looking at potential landslides,” said Neil Jacobs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at a news conference.

Jeffrey Byard, associate director at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Florence would be costly, in part because of the sheer volume of water it is unleashing and its slow movement.

The National Hurricane Center downgraded Florence to a tropical storm on Friday and expected to further downgrade it to a tropical depression by Saturday night. But the center continued to warn about the threat of water. It predicted dangerous storm surges of as much as 5 feet along the Carolina coastline.

President Trump approved a major disaster declaration for North Carolina on Saturday, freeing up federal funding for affected areas. He is expected to travel to areas affected by the hurricane next week, the White House said Friday.

To help with power outages, utility companies staged nearly 40,000 workers from 17 states on the outskirts of the storm, waiting until it is safe enough to move in. Utility poles were piled up alongside Interstate 95 to replace those snapped by winds and debris.

Between one million and three million power outages are expected, warned Duke EnergyCorp., the large power provider based in Charlotte, N.C. It warned that the hardest-hit communities could wait weeks for the power to come back on.

The Southeast’s big industries battened down. Meat companies including Tyson Foods Inc . , Smithfield Foods Inc., Pilgrim’s Pride Corp . and Wayne Farms LLC shut down operations from Pennsylvania to North Carolina. While some meat processors shifted production to plants outside the storm’s path, in other cases processing was put on hold altogether. Farmers worked to protect livestock and waste lagoons from heavy rains, and travel ground to a halt.

The disruption in North Carolina—the second-largest pork producing state, with nearly as many hogs as human residents—meant about 135,000 fewer hogs were slaughtered than forecast earlier in the week, according to Archer Financial Services, helping to boost wholesale pork prices.

The projected rainfall could present a problem for the power industry’s 26 coal-ash ponds in the Carolinas. Utilities were monitoring these facilities, which store toxic waste from coal-burning power plants. A heavy rain that caused the ponds to overflow could create an environmental catastrophe.

Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at weather.us, said the storm will dump approximately 10 trillion gallons of water on North Carolina, about a quarter of the annual total. That is roughly double the rainfall from Hurricane Matthew in 2016, he said. He estimated a total of 18 trillion gallons will fall on all affected states.

If the current forecasts hold, many regions could see “a flood of biblical proportions,” said Rick Neuherz, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service. “This could be our Harvey.”

New Bern, N.C., quickly became a trouble spot as floodwaters rose. Along the Neuse River, emergency responders pulled off some 200 rescues overnight and Friday morning, and about 150 people were still awaiting help, city spokeswoman Colleen Roberts said. The entire area had lost electricity, and some people were in chest-deep water while others retreated to attics, she said.

"Patient and advocacy groups filed a lawsuit Friday seeking to block the Trump administration’s plan to let people buy less-expensive health insurance that doesn’t comply with the Affordable Care Act.

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, takes aim at one of the central planks of the administration’s plan to roll back the Obama-era health law, after Congress failed to repeal it last year. It sets the stage for a legal standoff that could affect coverage and premiums for millions of Americans in 2019.

The Trump administration rule finalized in August loosens restrictions on a type of coverage known as short-term medical insurance—low-cost plans that cover a limited period with less-expansive benefit offerings, which are subject to fewer consumer protection regulations. The plans don’t have to cover people with pre-existing conditions, and insurers can charge higher premiums based on a consumer’s health status.

The lawsuit filed by organizations including the American Psychiatric Association and AIDS United argues that the rule runs contrary to the ACA and will harm patients by resulting in higher costs for those with medical conditions.

“The only practical difference between these plans and comprehensive insurance, then, is that they need not comply with the ACA’s protection requirements and can cherry pick healthier consumers—the precise practice prohibited by the ACA,” according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit was filed against Health and Human Services, the Treasury Department, and the Labor Department, their agency heads, and the Justice Department.

In a statement, HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said the plans “are an important option for people in certain circumstances, and the Trump administration is committed to delivering greater access to more affordable choices to the men and women left out by Obamacare.”

The Justice Department declined to comment. The Treasury Department and Labor Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The plan to allow for a proliferation of less robust but cheaper health plans sold on the individual insurance market has been widely expected to siphon off younger, healthier people who now buy coverage on the ACA’s exchanges. Health analysts have said that will cause insurers to raise premiums on the exchanges because younger, healthier consumers are needed to offset the costs of older, sicker, and more expensive individuals.

The result, they have said, will be a two-tiered market for people who buy their own coverage and don’t get it from federal programs or employers —with higher costs for those with pre-existing health issues. They have also said the plans will leave some consumers with huge costs if they develop a medical condition that isn’t covered.

The Trump administration and Republicans, however, have praised the rule as a way to provide relief to people who don’t get subsidies to offset premium costs on the exchanges. Costs have risen sharply for these individuals, and Republicans largely say insurance-coverage requirements imposed by the ACA are to blame.

The lawsuit is the latest in a spate of litigation that seeks to block changes that will weaken the health law.

Lawsuits have also been filed against new requirements in Kentucky and Arkansas that mandate many Medicaid recipients work and participate in community service to retain or get benefits. In July, a dozen attorneys general filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration from expanding access to a type of association health plan that doesn’t comply with all the ACA consumer protections.

Democratic attorneys general also have intervened in a case from 20 Republican states seeking to have the ACA knocked down entirely. Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh on Thursday filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Maryland against the Trump administration, saying it is sabotaging the ACA and that the law is constitutional.

“Together with the lawsuit filed by Maryland yesterday, this filing demonstrates that ACA supporters are willing and able to take the same aggressive litigation approach that opponents have taken in the past,” said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. “No act by the Trump administration to undermine the ACA will go unchallenged.”

"Saudi authorities on Saturday carried out a new wave of arrests, targeting royals and cabinet ministers in a crackdown against alleged corruption that comes as the Saudi leadership is seeking to consolidate power during a period of political transition.

Billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a prominent member of Saudi Arabia’s royal family and one of the world’s wealthiest men, was among at least 10 princes and more than two dozen current and former ministers detained by Saudi authorities on Saturday night, according to people familiar with the matter.

Mr. al-Waleed is a top investor in Apple Inc. and Twitter Inc. He faces charges of money laundering, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The targeting of senior princes like Mr. al-Waleed and of sitting cabinet ministers represents an escalation of a campaign of arrests launched by the Saudi leadership in recent months. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—elevated to heir apparent after his predecessor was deposed this summer—is consolidating power before his octogenarian father, King Salman, is expected to abdicate either later this year or early next year, people familiar with the matter said.

Mr. al-Waleed has long been one of Saudi Arabia’s most prominent business voices, but he hadn’t been seen as a major player in domestic politics. His father, Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud, however, has previously opposed Prince Mohammed’s rise to power.

Over the years Mr. Alwaleed was a key backer of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire, but he is no longer a significant shareholder in Wall Street Journal parent News Corp or 21st Century Fox Inc. after selling shares in recent years.

Representatives of the Saudi government and a spokeswoman for Mr. al-Waleed didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Two other prominent Saudi government officials were also detained, the people familiar with the matter said: Adel Fakieh, the economy minister, and Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, the head of the National Guard, one of three main branches of Saudi Arabia’s security forces. Both face charges of corruption.

King Salman on Saturday night issued royal orders firing the two men, without elaborating. Prince Mohammed has previously said he would go after graft at the highest level.

In September, the government arrested dozens of clerics and other public figures, some of whom had opposed Prince Mohammed’s moves toward liberalization. The government also warned Saudis that it wouldn’t tolerate criticism of its hard-line stance toward neighboring Qatar, with which it severed ties in June.

At the time, Saudi officials said the government was targeting people it suspected were involved in a nascent plot against the government.

Saturday’s arrests were carried out by a newly established anticorruption agency headed by the crown prince. The agency, formed on Saturday by a decree issued by King Salman, has far-reaching authority in cases of suspected corruption involving public funds, including the power to issue arrest warrants, to impose travel restrictions and to freeze assets.

“Laws will be applied firmly on everyone who touched public money and didn’t protect it or embezzled it, or abused their power and influence,” King Salman’s order said. “This will be applied on those big and small, and we will fear no one.”

Advertisement

The anticorruption committee marks a new effort to stamp out unscrupulous dealings in a country where the line between government money and the royal family isn’t always clear.

The crackdown comes as Saudi Arabia moves forward with an economic liberalization plan centered on the initial public offering of a piece of the state energy firm, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the largest oil producer in the world. The IPO could generate as much as $100 billion, making Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund the largest in the world and helping the kingdom invest in other areas beyond oil—a plan referred to as Vision 2030.

The arrests send a clear message that corruption won’t be tolerated as the kingdom pushes through its plan for economic reform, said Mohammed Alyahya, a Saudi political analyst and nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C.

“MBS has made it very clear that he will crack down on corruption, and that he is willing to do it from the top first,” Mr. Alyahya said, using a popular acronym for Prince Mohammed. “The bottom line is that corruption costs the government. We have economic problems…There is no way you can achieve Vision 2030 without tackling these issues.”

But the firing and arrest of Mr. Fakieh also creates a new complication for the kingdom’s economic plan, in which Mr. Fakieh had been playing a leading role.

The economic plan is already facing setbacks, such as a delay of the IPO of as much as 5% of Saudi Aramco, a centerpiece of the program.

Mr. Fakieh, who also served in the cabinet under King Salman’s predecessor, is succeeded by his deputy, Mohammed bin Mazyad al-Tuwajiri, a former banker at HSBC Holdings PLC.

Mr. Miteb was replaced at the National Guard by another, less prominent royal. Mr. Miteb is a son of the monarch’s predecessor, King Abdullah, and was one of few princes in a position of authority outside King Salman’s branch of the royal family. According to people familiar with the matter, he was among several senior princes who opposed the king’s decision in June to depose Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince in favor of Prince Mohammed.

The moves come as Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Muslim-dominated country, is fighting a war in Yemen, works to contain the influence of rival Iran, and is entangled in a political crisis involving its former ally Qatar.

Also Saturday, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, one of Saudi Arabia’s allies, stepped down from his post, saying he feared an assassination plot. Mr. Hariri blamed Iran for stoking tensions in his country.

"President Donald Trump sat down for an interview Thursday morning with four reporters from The Wall Street Journal: Rebecca Ballhaus, Michael C. Bender, Peter Nicholas and Louise Radnofsky. White House attendees included Communications Director Hope Hicks, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn.

Here is the expedited transcript of that interview. Portions of the interview were off the record, and have been excluded from this transcript.

The Wall Street Journal: Yes, actually that seems as good a place as any to start, maybe, in Davos…

President Donald Trump: Sure.

WSJ:…and if you could talk a little bit about your decision to go and the message you’re trying to send there and if you have thoughts about what you’re going to say.

Mr. Trump: Well, I think more than anything else it’s the great success that we’ve had in the last year. And you know if you remember the first quarter was a very low GDP, when Obama’s last quarter. It was the slowest growing recovery, a very minor recovery, but it’s the worst recovery they’ve had since the Great Depression. And our country was headed in the wrong direction.

The Wall Street Journal interviewed President Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday. Mr. Trump spoke about his relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and signaled openness to diplomacy with North Korea. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib gives us more insight from the interview. Photo: Getty

We were going down, we were going down a long way. I believe if the opposing party got in, I believe the stock market would have fallen 50 percent instead of gone up to the number it’s gone up. The regulations were choking people, choking companies like never before. It was out of control and they were only going to get worse.

The cutting of regulation and all of the many things that we’ve done, including being a cheerleader for the country—and perhaps that’s part of the reason I’m going to Davos also—but being a cheerleader for the country. Yesterday it was announced that Toyota is coming in with a very big plant in Alabama. It’s going to cost—they’re going to spend billions of dollars, four thousand jobs, create 300,000 cars a year within the country, which is what I want.

Prime Minister Abe told me about it, I pressed him very hard. I said, ‘We got to get your companies building here. We don’t want a building in Japan; we want to build them here. We have a lot of plants opening, car plants opening; we have a lot of things happening that would’ve never happened under the Democrats.

And I just think I want to tell the story of what’s happening in the United States. A lot of tremendous things are happening in the United States, including the fact that you can now live without being strangled by regulation. You people actually wrote one of the best stories that I’ve ever seen on regulation; you said more than any president in history.

That was the full pager, that wasn’t…

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump:…I mean I actually read it because I’ve never seen a full page—it’s actually a full page article.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: But, it was a full pager and essentially said there’s never been a president that’s been anywhere close on regulation. And you know, just so we understand. We need regulation, but we don’t need 19 different roadblocks getting to the same place and that’s what we had. And we have a long way to go, we’re cutting actually quite a bit of additional regulation. We’re looking at Dodd-Frank very strongly and I think we’ll have something on that.

I think it’s going to be bipartisan and we’re looking at other things and the bottom line is that the spirit in the country—you saw small business yesterday came out with the most enthusiastic they’ve ever been in the history of the report, which is a very old report.

Business, generally, manufacturing the same thing, but we have companies pouring back into this country and you saw that yesterday with Toyota.

WSJ: Did you see the other economy news yesterday? The markets did dip a little bit after some news suggesting that you were going to maybe pull out of Nafta. I wonder where you’re at on Nafta and if you’re concerned about the impact pulling out and renegotiating could have on the market.

Mr. Trump: I’m not sure that markets would dip; I think that markets would—I can tell you I’m not sure about world markets, but I can tell you I think the American market would go up if I terminated Nafta and renegotiated a new deal.

We are—when I campaigned I said we’ll either renegotiate Nafta or I’ll terminate it.

And nothing’s changed, I have fulfilled many of my campaign promises. One of the promises that you know is being very seriously negotiated right now is the wall and the wall will happen. And if you look—point, after point, after point—now we’ve had some turns. You always have to have flexibility. As an example, we’ve been much tougher on China, but not nearly as tough as I would be, but they are helping us a lot with North Korea.

And you see in North Korea what’s happening with North Korea all of a sudden. China’s been helping us a lot, so you can veer a little bit differently, but for the most part everything I’ve said I’ve done.

WSJ: And a question on China for you, just to follow up on Nafta, withdrawal is still on the table for you?

Mr. Trump: If we don’t make the right deal, I will terminate Nafta. OK?

Now, do I want to? No, I’d rather leave it, but I feel that if that if—you know, the United States has been treated very, very badly. That has been a terrible agreement for us, and if we don’t make a good deal for our country—we lose $71 billion in trade deficits with Mexico. We lose $17 billion with Canada. If we don’t make a fair deal for the United States and the United States taxpayer, then I will terminate it.

WSJ: Do you have a timetable on that? I know there’s another round of talks coming up here this month.

Mr. Trump: No, but, you know, I’m leaving it a little flexible because they have an election coming up. So I understand a lot of things are hard to negotiate prior to an election. They have an election coming up fairly shortly, and I understand that that makes it a little bit difficult for them, and I’m not looking to make the other side—so we’ll either make a deal or—there’s no rush, but I will say that if we don’t make a fair deal for this country, a Trump deal, then we’re not going to have—then we’re going to have a—I will terminate.

With that being said, I would rather be able to negotiate. We’ve made a lot of headway. We’re moving along nicely. Bob Lighthizer and others are working very hard, and we’ll see what happens.

But tremendous numbers of, you talk about auto plants like yesterday, but how about all the plants that have been taken out of this country and moved to Mexico. Like taking candy from a baby. No, I won’t let that happen.

WSJ: And you mentioned the link between China and North Korea. We talked about that a little bit the last time we were in here.

Mr. Trump: Right.

WSJ: Is that—does that link still exist for you? Do you feel like China’s been helpful enough...

(CROSSTALK)

Mr. Trump: Not helpful enough, but they’ve been very helpful. Let’s put it this way, they’ve done more for me than they ever have for any American president. They still haven’t done enough. But they’ve done more for me than they have, by far, for any—I have a very good relationship with President Xi. I like him. He likes me. We have a great chemistry together. He’s—China has done far more for us than they ever have for any American president. With that being said, it’s not enough. They have to do more.

WSJ: So when it comes to some of the decisions you have this month on aluminum, steel, the 301 case, does that...

(CROSSTALK)

Mr. Trump: For instance, at the very beginning, you know Obama felt—President Obama felt it was his biggest problem is North Korea. He said that openly. He said that to me, but he said that openly. It is a big problem, and they should not have left me with that problem. That should have been a problem that was solved by Obama, or Bush, or Clinton or anybody, because the longer it went, the worse, the more difficult the problem got. This should not have been a problem left on my desk, but it is, and I get things solved. And one way or the other, that problem is going to be solved.

China has been helping us, and I appreciate the help, but they can do much more.

WSJ: Are you worried, Mr. President, that sending—delaying military exercises on the peninsula for the Olympics sends the wrong message to the North?

Mr. Trump: Say it again?

WSJ: Are you concerned that delaying military exercises on the Korean Peninsula for the Olympics sends the wrong message to the North Koreans, that you’re in some way bending to them?

Mr. Trump: You’re the first one that’s asked that question. No, I don’t think anybody thinks that I’m bending. I think that people that, if anything, I’m being too tough.

No, I think it’s inappropriate to have the Olympics, have millions of people going to the Olympics hopefully, have North Korea going to the Olympics, and we’re having exercises on the beach. No, I think that it doesn’t—I think it sends a good message to North Korea, not a bad message. I think it would be totally inappropriate to do that during the Olympics.

WSJ: You think North Korea is trying to drive a wedge between the two countries, between you and President Moon?

Mr. Trump: I’ll let you know in—within the next 12 months, OK, Mike?

WSJ: Sure.

Mr. Trump: I will let you know. But if I were them I would try. But the difference is I’m president; other people aren’t. And I know more about wedges than any human being that’s ever lived, but I’ll let you know. But I’ll tell you, you know, when you talk about driving a wedge, we also have a thing called trade. And South Korea—brilliantly makes—we have a trade deficit with South Korea of $31 billion a year. That’s a pretty strong bargaining chip to me.

With that being said, President Xi has been extremely generous with what he’s said, I like him a lot. I have a great relationship with him, as you know I have a great relationship with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.

I have relationships with people, I think you people are surprised.

WSJ: Just to be clear, you haven’t spoken to the North Korean leader, I mean when you say a relationship with Korea—

Mr. Trump: I don’t want to comment on it—I don’t want to comment, I’m not saying I have or I haven’t. But I just don’t—

WSJ: Some people would see your tweets, which are sometimes combative towards Kim Jong Un...

Mr. Trump: Sure, you see that a lot with me and then all of a sudden somebody’s my best friend. I could give you 20 examples. You give me 30. I’m a very flexible person.

WSJ: Speaking of being flexible it sounds as if there’s an immigration deal that has been struck amongst senators on the hill that’s been sent to the White House for approval?

Mr. Trump: Getting close.

WSJ: Have you—have you seen anything from the Senate yet?

Mr. Trump: No but it’s getting close. They—want, I feel, you know, I have great feeling for DACA. I think that we should be able to do something with DACA. I think it’s foolish if we don’t, they’ve been here a long time, they’re no longer children, you know. People talk of them as children, I mean some are 41 years old and older. But some are in their teens, and late teens, but nevertheless I think we should do something with DACA and I think we should do something to help people.

It wasn’t their fault, their parents came in, it wasn’t their fault. So we’re in the process of trying to work something out. I hope we can do it. I don’t think it has to take that long. The lottery system is a disaster, we have to get rid of the lottery system. The—as you know chain is—chain migration is a horrible situation. You’ve seen the ads, you’ve seen everything, you know all about chain.

This person on the west side that killed eight people and badly, you heard me say yesterday, badly, badly wounded about 12. I mean people losing arms and legs—nobody even talks about that. But they say killed eight and that’s it. I mean you have people—ones walking around without—missing two legs. And the person was running to stay in shape and now he’s missing two legs. Think of it.

But this person, who should’ve never been allowed into this country, came in through the lottery. When they interviewed his neighborhood, they say he was horrible. You’d say good morning to him and he’d start cursing at you. They didn’t want him so they sent him through the lottery, you know, congratulations United States.

So the lottery has to end, chain migration—he brought in they say 22 people through the chain. So we have 22 of his relatives, why? And I honestly think that the Democrats are with us on that. We’ll find out. I mean who wouldn’t be? Who wouldn’t be? Unless it’s somebody that didn’t love our country, and the Democrats love our country. We have different views but the Democrats love our country.

So yeah, I think, Michael, I think we have a good chance to make a deal. We have to have a wall. We don’t have a wall, we’re not doing the deal.

WSJ: Do you have to have a completely funded wall or—would $1.6 billion be enough?

(CROSSTALK)

Mr. Trump: Let me, let me tell you something about the wall. So I’ve always said we have to have a wall. I’ve also said Mexico’s got to pay for it—sometimes you know on occasion, I’d add who’s going to pay for it? Mexico. Well they will pay for it, OK? There are many forms of payment. I could name 10 right now. There are many forms of payment, I didn’t say how.

WSJ: Could you give us an example?

Mr. Trump: They can pay for it through, as an example, they can pay for it indirectly through Nafta. OK? You know, we make a good deal on Nafta, say I’m going to take a small percentage of that money and it’s going to go toward the wall. Guess what? Mexico’s paying. Now Mexico may not want to make the Nafta deal and which is OK, then I’ll terminate Nafta…which I think would be frankly a positive for our country. I don’t think it’s a positive for Mexico, I don’t think it’s a positive for the world. But it’s a positive for our country because I’d make a much better deal. There is no deal that I can make on Nafta that’s as good as if I terminate Nafta and make a new deal. OK? But I feel that we have a chance of making a reasonable deal, the way it is now.

WSJ: On immigration—could you see yourself signing a bill….

Mr. Trump: The other thing…so the wall. The wall’s never meant to be 2,100 miles long. We have mountains that are far better than a wall, we have violent rivers that nobody goes near, we have areas...

But, you don’t need a wall where you have a natural barrier that’s far greater than any wall you could build, OK? Because somebody said oh, he’s going to make the wall smaller. I’m not going to make it smaller. The wall was always going to be a wall where we needed it. And there are some areas that are far greater than any wall we could build. So, maybe someday somebody could make that clear, Sarah, will you make that clear please?

I saw on television, Donald Trump is going to make the wall smaller; no, the wall’s identical. The other thing about the wall is we’ve spent a great deal of time with the Border Patrol and with the ICE agents and they know this stuff better than anybody, they’re unbelievable.

They both endorsed me, the only time they’ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate, OK? And they endorsed us unanimously. I had meetings with them, they need see-through. So, we need a form of fence or window. I said why you need that—makes so much sense? They said because we have to see who’s on the other side.

If you have a wall this thick and it’s solid concrete from ground to 32 feet high which is a high wall, much higher than people planned. You go 32 feet up and you don’t know who’s over here. You’re here, you’ve got the wall and there’s some other people here.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: If you don’t know who’s there, you’ve got a problem.

WSJ: Well, the other day after your meeting when you talked about wanting to see a deal from Congress. In particular, I’m thinking of the tweets from Ann Coulter. You know, a straight—I mean, they want a wall. Do you feel that you have some room to negotiate here with your own base, when it comes to the wall?

Mr. Trump: I don’t have to because the wall is the same wall I’ve always talked about. I can understand why I have to have see-through.

WSJ: OK.

Mr. Trump: If I’m standing here, I want to be able to see 200 yards out. I want to be able to see, I don’t want to have a piece of concrete that I can’t see.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: Now on the wall we have cameras and we have highly sophisticated equipment, but the wall—the Border Patrol tells me the other way’s more expensive. It’s not less expensive. We have to have vision through the wall.

WSJ: But…

Mr. Trump: This is going to be state of the art wall; this will be state of the art. But, I can fully understand why you’d have to have vision. I’d like to be able to see three or four hundred yards instead of we’re at a wall we have no idea who’s on the other side. Does this make sense or am I just wasting my time.

Hope Hicks: It’s what you’ve always talked; it’s consistent with what you’ve always said.

Mr. Trump: No, this is the same. I hope I don’t read tomorrow, Trump is going to make the wall, I always said, we need a wall.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: I never said the wall’s going to be two thousand, but there are—there is a vast amount of territory where nobody comes through.

WSJ: There’s this famous metaphor in politics about Nixon going to China.

Mr. Trump: Right.

WSJ: Is there a possibility that Donald Trump could sign a comprehensive immigration bill which would provide a path to legal status, citizenship for 11 million people who are here illegally?

Mr. Trump: Well, I’m not talking amnesty at all. I’m not talking amnesty at all, that’s the other thing. No, I think my base is with me. My base feels that these 800 thousand young people should not be thrown out of the country, OK? My base is with me and now I you know; and I think my base actually gets bigger.

And I’m not doing it because of the base or anything else, I’m doing it from the standpoint of heart, I’m doing it from the standpoint of common sense. I’m doing it from another standpoint too. You have a lot of people of those 800, they work hard, they have jobs. We need workers in this country; we need people to come in and work because I have a lot of companies moving in.

And I’m getting a lot of questions like we want to move to Wisconsin, we wanted—like Wisconsin, I have Foxconn coming to Wisconsin; that’s my deal. You know the head of Foxconn, you know he’s a friend of mine. He’s still only moving there because of me. And the governor has been fantastic.

The governor of Wisconsin has been fantastic in their presentations and everything else. But I’m the one who got them to look at it. Now we need people because they’re going to have thousands of people working it’s going to be a—you know—that’s—that’s the company that makes the Apple iPhone.

WSJ: Yeah.

Mr. Trump: Is that—they’re going to build them here, they’re going to build other things here too.

We need people so we have to be a little bit flexible. I don’t want to be so—I’ve had another pledge that I’m going to move companies back into this country. I don’t want to make it so tough that they can’t come back in.

Would you say that’s a correct statement, Gary, we have to have people.

Gary Cohn: Yeah.

WSJ: So when you say you have to have people, clearly there’s the 800,000 ‘Dreamers,’ but there’s also the larger group of people who are currently in the country…

Mr. Trump: That’s a different discussion.

WSJ: So, you said on Tuesday…

Mr. Trump: That’s comprehensive—well, if we could do that, that’s fine. I don’t know that that’s going to be possible.

There’s a lot of—there’s a lot of—there’s a big difference—first of all, there’s a big difference between DACA and Dreamers, OK?

Dreamers are different. And I want American kids to be Dreamers also, by the way. I want American kids to be Dreamers also.

But there’s a big difference between DACA and Dreamers. And a lot of times when I was with certain Democrats they kept using the word dreamer. I said, “Please, use the word DACA.” You know it’s a totally different word.

WSJ: Sure.

Mr. Trump: OK, people think they’re interchangeable, but they’re not.

So—I—I think we have a very good chance of making a deal on DACA, I would like to be able to do it; I think that the people that are Trump supporters agree with me on it. I would never do it without a wall, the wall is the wall and it’s the same wall that we’re always talking about. It’s—you know, wherever we need, we don’t need it where you have mountains; you don’t need it where you have rivers and—you know, vicious rivers.

So—so we have sort of natural barriers.

WSJ: Barriers, yeah.

Mr. Trump: And, obviously, we never intended (inaudible).

WSJ: Just to be really clear, because I don’t want to have any misunderstanding.

Mr. Trump: Yeah, be really clear, I’d like to—because I love The Wall Street Journal. I hope that you guys are clear. OK.

WSJ: For sure.

When—on Tuesday you said that you supported the idea of signing comprehensive immigration reform…

Mr. Trump: No, no I support the idea of discussing it.

WSJ: OK.

Mr. Trump: And, maybe, it’s possible to get it. You know, that’s what I do, I make deals. Despite what you read with—by these people that don’t know me, that were never interviewed by—to me, you know.

White House official: But first we have to (inaudible).

(CROSSTALK)

Mr. Trump: The man with the three hour interview, he spent three hours—the man who said he spent three hours in the Oval Office who I never met once in the White House. OK, you know—despite all these characters that are—that’s something you can talk about, is the libel laws, because we’ve got to increase our libel laws so when people make misstatements, like yourselves, but when people make misstatements somebody has some, you know, recourse.

WSJ: Do you have a plan for that, Mr. President?

Mr. Trump: Yeah, I do, I would—I would say—I don’t know that I’ll be able to get it though—but I think that when somebody makes false statements and libelous statements, whether it’s in a book or a newspaper or anything else. When they have phony sources, when the sources don’t exist, yeah I think they should have a liability.

WSJ: Do you think Congress needs to make new libel laws?

Mr. Trump: I don’t know if Congress has the guts to do that.

WSJ: But do you want them to?

Mr. Trump: I would like to see that. Yeah, I’d like to be able to—look, nobody gets more false press than I do. Nobody—nobody gets—nobody comes close. In history—in the history of this country nobody’s gotten more false press and you guys all know it.

WSJ: Why—why do you think that is?

Mr. Trump: They dislike me, the liberal media dislikes me. I mean I watch people—I was always the best at what I did, I was the—I was, you know, I went to the—I went to the Wharton School of Finance, did well. I went out, I—I started in Brooklyn, in a Brooklyn office with my father, I became one of the most successful real-estate developers, one of the most successful business people. I created maybe the greatest brand.

I then go into, in addition to that, part-time, like five percent a week, I open up a television show. As you know, the Apprentice on many evenings was the number one show on all of television, a tremendous success. It went on for 12 years, a tremendous success. They wanted to sign me for another three years and I said, no, I can’t do that.

That’s one of the reasons NBC hates me so much. NBC hates me so much they wanted—they were desperate to sign me for—for three more years.

WSJ: Mr. President, you made reference to the book. Steve Bannon…

Mr. Trump: Just—and so—so I was successful, successful, successful. I was always the best athlete, people don’t know that. But I was successful at everything I ever did and then I run for president, first time—first time, not three times, not six times. I ran for president first time and lo and behold, I win. And then people say oh, is he a smart person? I’m smarter than all of them put together, but they can’t admit it. They had a bad year.

WSJ: You mention the book—Steve Bannon was somebody important to your campaign, worked in the White House, was on the National Security Council for a while. Do you feel betrayed by him?

Mr. Trump: Yes, I do. I feel betrayed because you’re not supposed to do that, but I have many people that work for me who were far more important than Steve, right there.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: And others, I mean I could take you around to the back and I could show you many people, If you don’t—and some of them you wouldn’t know their names so (inaudible). Steve was—I always liked Steve, but Steve became very ineffective because he was such a lightning rod.

And Steve, in the end I fired Steve.

WSJ: Is that relationship permanently broken between you and Steve?

Mr. Trump: You never know, you know again, the word—– I don’t know what the word permanent means, OK? I never know what the word permanent means. We’ll see what happens, but Steve had nothing to do with my win. Well, certainly very little.

Steve’s greatest asset is he was able to convince a corrupt media that he was responsible for my win. Hope, just out of curiosity, you were there from day one. What do you think Steve in a percentage had to do with my victory?

I mean he was there. Corey [Lewandowski] had more to do with it.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: David had more to do with it. Many people— I mean, there were many people—it’s a little before Sarah’s time. If you were here, you would have had more to do with it. No, I talked to Steve very little; I didn’t know Steve well, believe it or not. They made it sound like—I mean when that guy wrote the book about Steve.

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: Don’t forget, I had vanquished 17 governors, senators plus a couple of very smart people, like Ben and Carly and others. I had vanquished them easily—easily. I won every debate based on the polls. You know, they do polls—seven or eight polls. Time Magazine—Time Magazine’s not a fan of mine.

Drudge, Time Magazine they have seven polls. I don’t think, I may be wrong—I don’t think you’ll find one poll that I ever lost in any of the 14, 15 debates. Including the presidential debate, you know with her, the three. Steve Bannon, I just wish him well…

WSJ: Sir can I ask you—

Mr. Trump: …but he had nothing to do with my—he was involved, but he had nothing to do with our victory. And he was there two months—what was it two months after? So, I beat 17 people, OK? So, Michael, you know politics, perhaps better than me.

WSJ: Not better.

Mr. Trump: You’ve been doing it longer, OK? That’s the other thing I’ve only been doing this for two years, two and a half years, OK? You know, it’s pretty good. When they said Jeb Bush was off his game; Trump killed him in the debate. Jeb was off his game because he hasn’t been governor now. He’s been out of politics for eight years. Oh, really? I’ve been out of politics for—I was never in politics.

So, sort of interesting, but when I won against the 17 people, you can’t then say that oh, gee, somebody comes in two months after I won, and he gives me new policy, new idea. I can’t change those ideas, those ideas are wedded.

WSJ: What seemed like the most egregious thing that Steve said was that was some of the things about your son and the Russian meetings.

Mr. Trump: What he said about my son is horrible. My son had a brief meeting based on the fact that he thought whatever he thought. And he—somebody said bad stuff on an opponent. I don’t know of one politician in Washington—if you’re a politician and somebody called up that they have information on your opponent that might be negative.

I’m not sure, but I don’t think there’s one politician in all of Washington that would not take that would not take that meeting, number one. Number two, after the meeting was over nothing happened. In other words, it wasn’t like OK let’s meet again in a month and let’s plan out the—nothing happened, it was a dead meeting.

WSJ: Did you ever hear about the meeting during the campaign?

Mr. Trump: No, I never did; I never knew about it.

White House official: Excuse me, I just—we have about two or three minutes left and you’ve got to go to a meeting.

Mr. Trump: Oh I do?

White House official: Yes, you have an 11:15. So, I can push it about five minutes, but that’s all we’ve got. So you’re running out of time.

WSJ: I’d like to ask a couple of questions about your tweets on the Russia investigation.

Mr. Trump: Yes.

WSJ: You had tweeted yesterday that you wanted Republicans in Congress to take control of the investigations. They control Congress. Do you want them to shut down those investigations?

Mr. Trump: No, I think—I just want them to—look, all I see of these Democrats, like Adam Schiff—it’s all he does, he’ll have a meeting, and then he’ll leave, and he’ll call up the meeting, and then I’ll have a meeting and then he’ll leave. He left meetings where people are being interviewed, and then all of a sudden they say a story about what’s going on inside the meetings.

It’s probably illegal, what he’s doing. But the Democrats know it’s a hoax. It’s an excuse for them having lost the election. They know it’s a hoax. And yet, they are milking it to a fare-thee-well and I think the Republicans— although I will say that over the last month the Republicans have started to get very tough. Because they realize there’s no collusion whatsoever. There’s no collusion.

WSJ: Do you think they’re close to ending the probe?

Mr. Trump: I hope so. Hey, look, I got elected president. I won easily, 306 or 304, depending on your definition, to 223. I won a race that should never be won by a Republican because it’s so stacked in the Democrats’ favor. I mean, if you figure California, New York, and Illinois, you start off with losing that—you have to run the entire East Coast and every— and the entire Midwest.

I won an election that should never be won, because the Electoral College is far harder to win than the popular vote. The popular vote, for me, would have been much easier.

WSJ: But just to be clear, you’re not asking for them to shut those congressional investigations down?

Mr. Trump: No, I just want them to be tough, be strong. I also think that primary collusion, because there was no collusion on our side, the collusion was on the Democrat side with the Russians. And what went on with the FBI, where a man is tweeting to his lover that if she loses, we’ll essentially go back to the—we’ll go to the insurance policy, which is—if they lose, we’ll go to phase 2, and we’ll get this guy out of office.

I mean, this is the FBI we’re talking about. I think that is—that is treason. See, that’s treason right there.

WSJ: Does any of that make you less...

Mr. Trump: By the way, that’s a treasonous act. What he tweeted to his lover is a treasonous act.

WSJ: Does any of that make you less likely or less inclined to testify before Mueller, or talk to Mueller’s people?

Mr. Trump: Look, there has never been in the history of this country an administration that, number one, did nothing wrong, and number two, was more open with a special counsel. We have—my lawyers are very good people. We made a decision right at the beginning. And it wasn’t their original idea. They figured, like, well, we’ll fight this (inaudible).

After they looked at all the letters, all the facts, every email, they saw nothing. They said, “We should be open.” There has never been a more— they said, “You never did anything wrong.” To be honest, they probably were surprised, OK? As most lawyers would be. They said, “You never did anything wrong.”

And they said, and I agree with them, “We should be upfront, give them a”—we gave them everything.

WSJ: So if asked if...

Mr. Trump: There has never been, in the history—in the history of an administration anybody that was more open than we were. You understand that?

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: We gave them everything. We didn’t go to court and say, “You can’t have this document, you can’t have”—and what we gave them showed—I never got a phone call from Russia. I didn’t have a tweet. I didn’t have a—I had nothing. I didn’t have an email. I didn’t have a meeting. I didn’t have—did I have one meeting with—about Russia? And...

WSJ: Well, Mueller’s also looking at some other areas, right? Like obstruction of justice...

Mr. Trump: Well allow—let me—(inaudible). So, they make up a crime, and the crime doesn’t exist. And then they say obstruction. And how could there be obstruction on firing Comey? When the man who’s in charge of it wrote a letter that was far stronger than anything I would have written. He was in charge—Deputy Rosenstein. He wrote a letter that’s far stronger than even what I say.

And here’s another thing. A friend of mine brought this up the other day. Comey. Comey has proven to be a liar and a leaker. Proven. He tries to act like a choir boy. What he did with Hillary Clinton is outrageous. He saved her life, because all of those charges—I call it “Comey one, two, and three,” all of those charges and Comey won, she was guilty of. She should have been taken out of the campaign and been on trial.

He didn’t do that. He saved her life. But here’s the way you look at Comey. Everybody hated Comey, and Comey—by the way, the FBI, say what you want, go back to look at the day around Hillary—the FBI was in turmoil. Everybody hated Comey. The Democrats wanted him fired. Everybody wanted him out. You look at what Schumer said about him, you look at what everybody said. As soon as I fired him they said, “oh, he’s wonderful—he’s wonderful, how could you do that.”

So there’s no—you have a no-crime that was created, you have a phony crime and then they talk about obstruction. And how can they talk about obstruction when I was the most open person, in history, in terms of—there’s never been a paper we didn’t give them, there’s never been a question we didn’t answer.

Now, I could of done it differently. I’ve been, you know, pretty successful in the courts over the years, I’ve been a very successful person, you can check—USA Today said, “he does great in the courts,” OK?

Unknown: Sorry to interrupt. We have to—you’re late for your meeting. No, I know, finish this thought and then if—I’d love to get like an infrastructure or tax question in before you guys go—I know that was sort of the premise of the meeting.

(CROSSTALK)

Mr. Trump: They don’t want to talk about that—they don’t want to talk about the biggest tax bill (inaudible).

Unknown: But, we just have about two minutes left, so— you finish, yeah.

Mr. Trump: OK, all right, well we’ll do as much as we can.

So, just to finish, everybody wanted Comey fired. And then, when I fired, I never forget, when I fired, all these people that had just said, “You’ve got fire Comey”, they said, “oh, he just fired Comey.” Well now they’re—the—on the other side, they’re Democrats. So all of a sudden they change.

All you have to do is take a look, seriously—take a look at all these people, they all wanted him fired. And the FBI was a mess. When he announced the Hillary Clinton fiasco where she was guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty and then where they did the interview with no tape recorder, with no swearing in, with no this, with no that—you know the story.

But take a look at all of these people that became critics of my firing, they all wanted him fired. And they wanted him fired until I said, “he’s fired.” But the deputy, Rosenstein, who is in charge, he wrote a letter that was possibly or probably stronger than anything I would have written or did write.

WSJ: So you’re saying there was no obstruction, if Mueller asks you to come in and talk about it, would you—

(CROSSTALK)

Mr. Trump: Of course there was no obstruction—excuse me. Of course there was no obstruction. But there was no crime. So now they’re saying, could there be—now, I haven’t even heard that they’re looking at obstruct—I don’t know that they’re looking at obstruction.

But how can you—I’m sorry, this is the most open dialogue ever, I’ve given everything, number one. That’s not obstruction.

The other thing is, everybody wanted Comey fired. And, another thing, and this is just a few, Comey has proven to be a leaker and a liar and, if anything, I should get credit for firing him because it turned out I was right because many thing have been found out about Comey that—I mean, I should be given credit for having great insight because many things have been found out about Comey that would never have been found out if I didn’t fire him.

WSJ: (Inaudible) infrastructure (inaudible).

Mr. Trump: But just so you understand…

WSJ: Oh, sorry.

Mr. Trump: …The deputy attorney general, who’s in charge of the case, wanted—all you have to do is read his letter. So that’s— there’s no obstruction there.

WSJ: How about a welfare and a tax question real quick before we wrap it up?

Mr. Trump: Yeah, go ahead.

Unknown: Yeah, let’s finish on that and then you really do have to go, you’ve got a Roosevelt Room full of people waiting for you. So go ahead.

Mr. Trump: I do?

Unknown: Yes, you do.

Mr. Trump: OK, get me a list of those people.

Unknown: Yes, sir.

Mr. Trump: I’ll see the level of it.

(LAUGHTER)

I do enjoy this, actually.

WSJ: Yeah, this is fun, thank you for taking the time.

Mr. Trump: I do ask you this, treat me fairly.

WSJ: We always do.

Mr. Trump: We’ll do it—every month we’ll do one of these. But—because I do respect and I love and I think [WSJ editor in chief] Gerard [Baker]—I always call him the most elegant debate—I thought it was the best debate, maybe because I like that one good from my standpoint.

WSJ: Yeah.

Mr. Trump: But I thought he was very elegant. I always say, “You’re the elegant host.”

I went through some that weren’t so elegant. But all I’m asking is one thing, you know what I’m saying, it’s very easy, treat me fairly.

WSJ: We do.

So I just want to be crystal clear about this, you’re open to discussing comprehensive immigration reform, are you open to discussing a path to citizenship as part of that?

Mr. Trump: Ready? Comprehensive immigration reform is a far step from DACA. I am always open to discussing everything but that doesn’t mean we’re going to get anywhere close to getting it done.

I’d love to get something done if it’s appropriate. But there’s no—I think we will get DACA, I really believe we’re getting close to DACA and I’m dealing with some great people on the Democrat side. I’m dealing with some people that I really have gotten to like.

WSJ: Who?

Mr. Trump: And I really believe they have good intention. After we’re finished with DACA, assuming that gets done, I would certainly be open to discussing—you know, the comprehensive immigration. I don’t know that we’ll be able to make a deal on that one.

WSJ: Got it. And so on this—this welfare…

Mr. Trump: You understand what I mean.

WSJ: Yes, I now—I think we’re nice and clear on that one.

Mr. Trump: So that’s a very different—very different topic.

WSJ: Yeah, do you think welfare reform or infrastructure is more feasible?

Mr. Trump: Well I think we’re going to start with infrastructure. We’re very far down the line. Gary [Cohn] actually met with Elizabeth Warren yesterday and I heard, actually, had a very good conversation. My team met—Gary, you had a whole group of people—and they had a good conversation. We’ll start with infrastructure and we’ll see. If we do infrastructure I think that has to be bipartisan—and I think it will be. I think we’ll have a lot of Democrat support.

And I think with welfare reform that will have to be bipartisan. You know, we only have a majority of one and unless we get more Republicans in the next election or the next two elections we won’t be able to do that and as Republicans we’re going to have to have a bipartisan.

So, if we do welfare reform it’s going to have to be bipartisan.

WSJ: And just so we understand, what programs are welfare reform targets?

Mr. Trump: Well, I’d rather talk to you about that later because honestly, we’re doing infrastructure first; OK? We’ll do that again.

WSJ: Infrastructure—would that be a trillion-dollar direct federal outlay? Or is that a public/private partnership?

Mr. Trump: It’s going to be a combination of public/private which is now the new hot topic. We’ll be putting up approximately $200 billion. It could be as much as $1.8 trillion spent. We have many, many, wealthy countries, some of whom our country made wealthy, but we have many countries, any people that really want to put up tremendous amounts of money for the infrastructure. That gets it built faster, gets it built better, gets it built on time, on budget and the United States won’t be putting up all of the money.

WSJ: Where does the federal share come from?

Mr. Trump: The $200 billion?

WSJ: Yes.

Mr. Trump: Well, that’s not a large amount. I mean—think of this—I hate to say it but it’s not my fault and I did not want to go into Iraq, by the way. But as of two months ago we’re into the Middle East for $7 trillion. We made a lot of headway in the Middle East, by the way. I’ve knocked out ISIS and Syria and Iraq and all but— and we’re doing well in Afghanistan for the first time ever. But you’ll see the results over the next three or four months like you won’t believe.

WSJ: You’re not talking about taking it out of the military budget?

Mr. Trump: No, never out of the military. No—no, no. Nothing comes out of the military. We’re making the military strong, again. Just the opposite—we’re building the military budget very substantially; you know that.

WSJ: I mean do you have to find cuts or is this new spending? Would you be willing to spend new money on this?

Mr. Trump: No. This will be—this will be money that we will find. There’s a lot of places to find $200 billion. There are not a lot of places to find $1.8 trillion. I see Gary shaking his head, yes; correct? $200 billion sounds like a lot but relative to what we’re talking about it’s a number that we can easily handle.

Whereas again people will come in and put up vast amounts of money. They will supervise the projects, they will make sure they get built on time, on budget—or below budget which is even better. And so, what we’re talking about is about $200 billion. And, Gary, am I right when I say $1.7 trillion to $1.8 trillion?

Mr. Cohn: Exactly right, sir.

Mr. Trump: Approximately—so it will be actually $1.8 trillion of investment in our infrastructure which will largely rebuild our infrastructure.

That will include bridges, roadways, tunnels; it will include many things. One of the things we’re doing separate of that will be air-traffic control. Our air-traffic control is from a different planet. It’s horrible. It’s a horrible mess.

Our air-traffic control doesn’t work. They have spent billions and billions of dollars on it over the last seven years. Billions and it’s worthless. They had many different contractors doing many different locations using all different computers and computer companies. And when they hooked it up it didn’t work. So, I’m good at that stuff—we’ll fix it.

WSJ: One last quick question.

Mr. Trump: Go ahead.

WSJ: I just want to get a tax one in here too.

Mr. Trump: The tax bill has turned out to be far greater than we ever anticipated.

WSJ: Can you talk about it in a midterm framework here? Are you going to go out and sell this for the Republicans?

Mr. Trump: It’s selling itself, Michael. Michael, it’s selling itself.

WSJ: Do you plan to help in the midterms?

Mr. Trump: One thing nobody anticipated was that these companies would come in and pay all of this money to the employees—to millions and millions of employees. And AT&T started it, but it was picked up by Comcast and another one.

Many are announcing today—and the ones that aren’t announcing you know what’s happening? The employees are going, what about us? Did you forget us—to the ones that—that was never anticipated. That was just one of the many benefits. You know this bill—and I said from the beginning this bill will be so good—and the Democrats are very concerned. They’re very concerned. This bill has turned out to be even better than we thought. It’s really having a big—and I’m also hearing a lot of people are bringing money back in. You know, the $4 trillion that we’re talking about or whatever it may be. Nobody even knows what it is, but it’s a big number.

WSJ: Just on the midterms, are there concrete steps that the administration is taking to make sure Russia doesn’t interfere in the 2018 elections?

Mr. Trump: We’re going to be very careful. We’re going to be very, very, careful about Russia—and about anybody else, by the way.

WSJ: What are you doing to make sure?

Mr. Trump: We are absolutely—at the appropriate time and first of all we’re working on different solutions.

And as you know the last election was not affected in terms of votes—and I think you do understand that everybody—even the Democrats agree to that—a lot of people don’t write it. But we are looking at all sorts of failsafes and we are going to make sure that no country including Russia can have anything to do with the result of the midterms or any other election; OK? That’s what our country is all about.

Unknown: Thank you, guys, so much.

WSJ: Thank you, (inaudible). Thank you, Mr. President.

WSJ: Mr. President, do you expect Rex Tillerson to stay on?

Mr. Trump: Yeah, Rex and I are getting along very well.

WSJ: And Gary Cohn, and…

Mr. Trump: I don’t know, Gary, are you staying on?

Unknown: Gary, are you staying?

Mr. Cohn: Very happy. We were—we’re doing great things on the economy.

WSJ: Well usually, it’s—the New Year mark is a time when—when—when there’s—

Mr. Trump: Oh, I know it’s the time. But look, hey, Gary may leave and Rex may leave but I don’t anticipate it. I hope Gary stays and we’ll see.

WSJ: H.R.—H.R. McMaster?

Unknown: Guys, thank you—

Mr. Trump: You know what? I like him. I like him. I like them all.

WSJ: OK.

Mr. Trump: We’ll find out. But people do leave. You guys may leave The Wall Street Journal, right?

"Business leaders disbanded two CEO councils created by the White House, a move they said was protesting Donald Trump’s failure to sufficiently condemn racism, marking a dramatic break between U.S. companies and a president who has sought close ties with them.​

In the hours that followed Mr. Trump’s combative news conference Tuesday—during which he appeared to apportion blame equally between white supremacist groups and counterprotesters for lethal violence in Charlottesville, Va.—executives on two prominent advisory councils started calling each other to discuss whether to stay on.

On a 45-minute conference call that started around 11:30 a.m. ET Wednesday, members of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum decided to dissolve the group.

Blackstone Group LP chief Stephen A. Schwarzman, who organized the conference call, called the White House and spoke with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and a presidential adviser, to give him the news, according to a person familiar with the call. Around the same time, the manufacturing council also had a call and decided to disband.

Within minutes of the call to Mr. Kushner, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that he had dissolved the councils: “Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!”

A White House spokesman declined to comment.

The unraveling of the business councils marks a dramatic moment in corporate America’s relationship with the presidency.

From its start, the Trump White House had proclaimed an open-door policy for the country’s top business leaders. Many chief executives, while wary of being associated with the president’s more contentious policies, such as on immigration and climate change, have been eager to help Mr. Trump, a fellow businessman, shape his agenda of deregulation and tax overhaul.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.’s James Dimon wrote that he disagreed with Mr. Trump’s reaction to recent clashes in Charlottesville, according to an internal memo sent Wednesday afternoon and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. “Racism, intolerance and violence are always wrong…There is no room for equivocation here,” Mr. Dimon said. “It is a leader’s role, in business or in government, to bring people together, not tear them apart.”

Companies Wednesday stopped short of saying they would refuse to work with the White House in the future, though executives and corporate crisis managers noted that the reputational costs of sticking with the president have risen sharply.

Several CEOs have faced pressure from their own employees or parts of the public for remaining on the council, including International Business Machines Corp.’s Ginni Rometty and PepsiCo ’s Indra Nooyi.

Ms. Rometty and Ms. Nooyi, along with Boston Consulting Group’s Rich Lesser and BlackRock Inc. chief Laurence Fink, were among several leaders who joined Wednesday’s call prepared to resign from the Strategic and Policy Forum, participants said.

Mr. Schwarzman led Wednesday’s call and gave each member an opportunity to speak, people who participated on the call said.

“It became clear very quickly that there was a consensus” to disband the group in total, one participant said. “It was important that it be addressed as a group and not a drip-drip.”

Some panel members said they regretted losing a seat at the table as the White House deliberated on policies that could affect their companies, especially with a president who wasn’t familiar with many of their industries.

But members observed that the Strategic and Policy Forum only met twice in about eight months, with about half of the council members attending both meetings.

Jim McNerney, the former CEO of Boeing, didn’t agree with disbanding the group, according to people on the call, yet agreed to go along with the decision. Attempts to reach Mr. McNerney for comment were unsuccessful.

Toward the end of the conversation, a participant raised the specter of a “tweet storm” in reaction from Mr. Trump, participants said. Earlier in the week, Mr. Trump tweeted angrily after the CEOs of Merck & Co., Intel Corp. and Under Armour Inc. announced they were quitting his manufacturing council.

Business leaders now face the challenge of trying to stay in the president’s ear without a formal advisory position. Two companies whose leaders served on the Strategic and Policy Forum indicated Wednesday they would remain open to advising the president on future policy matters.

Created in the early days of the Trump presidency, the Strategic and Policy Forum and manufacturing-advisory council gathered CEOs for Mr. Trump to consult as he implemented a broad economic plan that included reworking the U.S. tax code and trying to stem the flow of U.S. jobs to other countries.

Individual members of both councils had discussed disbanding the forum for months, especially after the decision to leave the Paris climate accord in June and again in July when Mr. Trump barred transgender individuals from serving in the military, members said.

Yet plenty of executives saw value in remaining on the forums until Tuesday afternoon’s news conference. Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky issued a statement early Tuesday that said he would remain on the manufacturing council and advocate for values like diversity and inclusion from the inside.

But President Trump’s news conference made staying untenable for most members. On Wednesday, Mr. Gorsky issued another statement saying he was leaving the council. “The President’s most recent statements equating those who are motivated by race-based hate with those who stand up against hatred is unacceptable and has changed our decision to participate,” Mr. Gorsky said.

Executives have faced tough questions from workers and young recruits over their relationship with the White House. A poll initiated by Boston Consulting Group employees this week on Fishbowl, a social network for professionals, found 83% of more than 100 respondents thought Mr. Lesser, the CEO, should step down from the advisory council.

Around 40 people protested outside the New York offices of J.P. Morgan and then Blackstone on Wednesday, and social-media campaigns heavily criticized corporate chiefs for not quitting the councils.

Color of Change, a nonprofit activist group, spearheaded a campaign with the hashtag #QuitTheCouncil and aimed its posts at executives including Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison and PepsiCo ’s Ms. Nooyi. Ms. Morrison withdrew from the manufacturing council Wednesday morning.

"The world oil market is notoriously quick to react to headlines, but a seemingly significant one last week from the owner of the world’s largest reserves didn’t cause so much as a blip.

According to reports, all from Venezuelan authorities, the China Development Bank earlier this month pledged either $250 million or $5 billion “in favor of the increasing and strengthening of the country’s oil production.”

That Venezuela’s major industry needs “increasing and strengthening” is beyond question. Oil output crashed below a three-decade low to 1.34 million barrels a day last month. That is a million less than just three years ago and 2 million below the level when Hugo Chávez took power in 1999.

Chávismo clearly has been very bad for Venezuela’s oil production. Until recently it was very good for China, however, and its twin goals of expanding its influence and satisfying its need for oil. A report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies stated earlier this year that “China’s influence in Latin America is neither transparent nor market-oriented.”

But China clearly miscalculated in Venezuela, where it is now throwing good money after bad. The CSIS tallies $55 billion in energy-related loans alone that it has extended. Unable to come up with hard currency to service them, Venezuela has been paying in discounted barrels of oil but struggled even to do that after prices collapsed in 2014. China offered a “grace period” on some loans.

At one point when prices were higher and its oil industry less decrepit, Venezuela was sending China 600,000 barrels a day, according to Russ Dallen, the chief executive of Caracas Capital Markets, who has done extensive work untangling Venezuela’s opaque finances. He estimated that has brought the balance down to about $20 to $23 billion, plus another $3 billion to $4 billion owed to Russian oil company Rosneft.

The cash drain from these enormous debts may have exacerbated the decline in output, and there is scant chance that China’s latest infusion will do much to arrest the fall. Hence the market’s shrug at the news. But why does cash keep flowing in?

Part of it is the potential equity value of that bad debt. Chinese and Russian companies have been given valuable hydrocarbon concessions—in some cases including properties expropriated from Western firms such as Exxon Mobil . While past loans are a disaster, China and Russia now have investments to protect. Disbursing more modest, targeted sums makes sense.

Venezuela needs that cash. Right now it only can sell about 500,000 barrels a day for hard currency.

For those interested in the short-term impact on the oil market, new loans should be viewed as a way to protect the status quo. They make an outright collapse in output through internal unrest less likely, but they probably won’t arrest the decline either.",world

Is the “progressive” left finally ready to acknowledge the benefits of pro-growth tax reform? The intriguing possibility comes to us courtesy of the ABC television program, “The View.” That’s where Meghan McCain sparked a heated discussion this week by wisely warning about the miseries resulting from socialism.

When program host Whoopi Goldberg raised the subject of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the socialist selected by voters in the Democratic primary for a U.S. house seat in New York City, Ms. McCain helpfully noted that socialism has failed worldwide and is currently resulting in malnutrition and even starvation in Venezuela.

This is not necessarily a message that folks gathered around a Manhattan television set like to hear. Real Clear Politics reports:

Meghan McCain and Joy Behar clashed over the rise of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and ‘normalization’ of democratic socialism on Tuesday’s edition of ABC’s The View. McCain said she hopes Democrats run on the democratic socialism platform because they will “lose spectacularly.”

“At a certain point, you run out of spending other people’s money,” McCain, quoting Margaret Thatcher, said.

The conversation got so heated that host and moderator Whoopi Goldberg had to step in to stop the two talking over each other.

Behar cited several Scandinavian countries as proof that socialism does work.

This response from Ms. Behar is almost as encouraging as Ms. McCain’s stalwart advocacy for liberty, and not only because it signals that even the northeast media crowd has stopped looking for silver linings in the societal disaster that is Venezuela. In recent years Scandinavian countries have been moving away from socialism after observing proof that it doesn’t work.

Ms. Behar has perhaps learned of the virtues of Scandinavian public policy from Bernie Sanders, who frequently sang its praises during his 2016 presidential campaign. Perhaps because the radical views of the Vermont socialist hardened in the 1960s and 1970s and have proven impervious to new data in the years since, Mr. Sanders may not have grasped the encouraging news from our northern friends.

In 2016 Swedish academic Daniel Schatz, then a visiting scholar at Columbia University, noted that the explosion of Nordic social welfare programs in Mr. Sanders’ formative years occurred only because the countries had grown wealthy by allowing more open economies than their European neighbors.

After enacting these expensive entitlements, Scandinavian voters then realized that their only hope of paying for them lay in the preservation of robust market economies.

The international tax table maintained by the accounting firm KPMG shows the success these countries have had in holding corporate income taxes to competitive rates. Over the last 15 years Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have all made impressive cuts to their corporate income tax rates. Thanks to the Trump tax cuts enacted last year, the U.S. is finally operating in their neighborhood.

When it comes to overall tax competitiveness, the Tax Foundation ranks Sweden in the top 10 among OECD countries, with Norway, Finland and Denmark not too far behind.

Also unlike Venezuela and other socialist experiments, Scandinavian countries maintain predictable legal systems under the rule of law and less business regulation than many of their competitors in the international marketplace. The Heritage Foundation—not exactly an outfit known for being soft on socialist countries—publishes an index of economic freedom and ranks Iceland, Denmark and Sweden above the United States, with Norway and Finland also in the top 26. Venezuela clocks in at 179th, just ahead of North Korea.

Does this mean that voters can hope that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is a Scandinavian-style “socialist” who wants the U.S. to have a globally competitive corporate income tax rate? Her recent comments suggest not, but perhaps she’ll be willing to appear on “The View” and give Ms. McCain the chance to persuade her.

"Fresh doubts are emerging about the potency of a U.S.-led sanctions campaign aimed at crippling North Korea’s economy and forcing the country to end its atomic-weapons programs, as denuclearization talks have stalled.

A confidential new United Nations report, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, says Pyongyang, often with help from people in Russia and China, has been able to circumvent restrictions, rendering “the latest U.N. sanctions ineffective.”

Citing U.S. intelligence, U.N. investigators found a “massive increase” in fuel shipments to North Korea involving Russian and Chinese ships, as well as numerous examples of coal shipments to China from North Korea.

The U.N. report also called out Chinese companies for buying tens of millions of dollars of North Korean iron, steel and other products. Chinese firms have maintained joint ventures with North Korean partners, despite a U.N. ban last year, the report says. Chinese tourism to North Korea is rebounding.

All of that amounts to a serious setback for what the Trump administration calls a maximum-pressure campaign to isolate North Korea, cut off its energy supplies and curb its ability to raise money through exports.

China and Russia have rejected U.S. accusations they aren’t fully enforcing U.N. sanctions on North Korea. Pyongyang disputes the sanctions’ legality.

Pyongyang’s success in skirting export and import limits shows that, after decades of international pressure, it has built a resilient web of funding streams and trade networks that are difficult to completely sever.

There is little doubt North Korea’s economy is being hurt, but the country’s sanctions-evasion tactics could give it breathing room as negotiations with Washington have reached an impasse.

“I’m very concerned that our maximum-pressure campaign is faltering,” Ed Royce, the Republican House foreign-affairs committee chairman, said last week. “Kim appears to be using talks, as he has time and time again, to probe for weaknesses and buy time.”

Top Trump officials say the negotiations are proof the pressure campaign is working, but have expressed growing frustration in recent months over what they see as easing enforcement by China and Russia, in particular.

“The full implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions remains mandatory for all member states,” U.S. envoy to the U.N. Nikki Haley said late last week.

Other evidence suggests North Korea is earning significant sums of money from overseas businesses and guest workers, including North Korean restaurants that were supposed to close but remain open in some countries.

The new U.N. report also found North Korean involvement in illicit arms sales, citing evidence that a Syrian arms trafficker brokered a deal for Houthi rebels in Yemen to buy rocket-propelled grenades, ballistic missiles and other weapons from North Korea.

One of the best-known businesses linked to Pyongyang, a military communications equipment company called Global Communications Co. and described by the U.N. as a front for North Korean intelligence, continues operating despite being cited in U.N. reports.

Malaysia’s government said it closed Glocom’s operations in the country last year. Yet Mike Kuah, who runs Fabulous System Bhd., a Kuala Lumpur-based company that sells military radios, says he purchased battlefield radios this year from Glocom after locating it online.

Glocom uploaded new marketing videos to YouTube this year and advertises multiple products on Twitter.

Mr. Kuah said he had no idea of Glocom’s ties to North Korea, believing at first the equipment was South African based on its appearance. An invoice provided by Mr. Kuah for the radios he bought showed an address for the company in Shenzhen, China. A Journal reporter tried to visit the site but found it didn’t exist.

Mr. Kuah didn’t respond when asked to whom he later sold the radios. Under U.N. sanctions, any trade in North Korean military equipment is illegal.

Deliveries of petroleum products to North Korea, meanwhile, represent a particularly difficult problem for Washington because they offer a lifeline to North Korea’s economy.

U.N. sanctions imposed late last year amounted to a nearly 90% ban on oil and refined petroleum, which the Security Council has said are vital to Pyongyang’s military and nuclear programs.

The Journal reported last week that North Korean ships had brought in at least 89 illicit cargoes of fuel in the first five months of the year via ship-to-ship transfers, primarily with Chinese or Russian counterparts. The estimated volume is roughly a third of the country’s average consumption before the current sanctions regime was put into place, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

North Korea’s Chon Ma San made four deliveries in April and June, delivering up to 74,000 barrels of fuel oil into the country’s Nampo port weeks after the U.N. blacklisted it, according to U.S. intelligence reports reviewed by the Journal.

Although North Korea’s tightly sealed borders and limited information flow make it hard to assess how deeply sanctions are affecting the country’s economy, they are widely believed to have had an impact last year, when the economy is thought to have contracted.

Yet after tripling late last year, fuel prices have fallen back to near pre-quota levels, according to data collected by the South Korea-based website NK Daily.

Unofficial exchange rates have been stable. At the border city of Sinuiju on Aug. 21, a dollar traded for 8,140 won, only up a hair from 8,100 in October 2016.

Many economists speculate Pyongyang is burning though its foreign-currency reserves to help prop up the won and prevent hyperinflation, forecasting more pain likely by 2019. But others argue the won’s stability shows sanctions haven’t been as effective as hoped.

President Trump and others have singled out China for what they say is lax enforcement. Some former senior U.S. Treasury officials say the recent stall in negotiations aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and normalizing relations with the U.S. is at least in part a political consequence of weak sanctions enforcement.

China appears to be enforcing many of the rules. In Dandong, a major conduit of China-North Korea trade, businesses say restrictions continue to crimp cross-border commerce, with Chinese border officials checking tourists’ luggage for products prohibited by sanctions.

In Hunchun, another border city, seafood traders say their businesses have withered under a U.N. ban on North Korean seafood exports. An “international seafood trading center,” opened in mid-2016, is derelict.

Even so, some seafood wholesalers and restaurants say they are able to rely on smuggling and other measures to get around the ban, with goods ferried at night or delivered in small quantities to avoid detection.

“The government has been tacitly allowing the North Korean seafood trade,” especially after Mr. Kim’s visits to China this year, said a seafood-industry worker who would only give his surname, Qi.

China also appears to be relaxing some of its own restrictions put in place in recent years when Beijing wanted to register anger over Pyongyang’s missile programs.

A thaw in bilateral ties this year has seen a surge in Chinese travel to North Korea, for instance. Roughly a thousand Chinese travelers entered North Korea daily in recent months, a multifold increase from a year earlier, travel agencies in Dandong said.

Although income from tourism isn’t enormous, it can help offset losses in industries affected by sanctions, experts say. Demand has been such that there aren’t enough tour buses and hotel rooms in North Korea, according to tour operators in Dandong.

Hunchun this summer set up an immigration-services center to process travel papers for Chinese tourists within an hour. Dandong’s tourism authority has published sample North Korea itineraries on its website.

“It’s not in China’s interests to squeeze North Korea to the brink of collapse,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor at Renmin University in Beijing.

The U.N. panel also said it found more than 200 Chinese joint ventures with North Korea, collaboration banned last year by the Security Council. According to a July U.S. Treasury Department advisory, those companies conduct business including software development, construction and aquaculture.

"Let’s call it China’s Dreamers moment.

The city of Beijing began evicting large numbers of rural migrants this past week, as part of a safety campaign after a deadly fire in a slum tenement that housed many migrants.

In the U.S., the so-called Dreamers are young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. In China, the dreamers are domestic migrants who moved from farms to megacities in pursuit of better opportunities. Many of these migrants live as second-class citizens, with tenuous residency rights and limited access to city social services.

These migrants have fueled China’s booming tech industry. They drive ride-sharing cars and deliver parcels and food ordered online. Their better-educated peers are programmers and professionals at internet companies in Beijing. A few major company founders were migrants.

When President Donald Trump decided to end the U.S. program that protects the Dreamers from deportation, American tech companies signed open letters and supported lawsuits to stop the repeal. They argue that the Dreamers are contributing members of the community and add to the U.S. economy’s competitive edge.

No such protests emerged from China’s tech firms in response to the evictions in Beijing, one of the country’s biggest internet hubs. In fact, online news and social-media platforms, most of them based in Beijing, scrubbed their sites of critical postings, including a public appeal from lawyers, academics and labor activists to stop the campaign.

Tech companies haven’t sat on their hands. E-commerce company JD.com sent a text message last weekend offering stipends and the use of company dormitories and vehicles to any Beijing employees forced to move.

But the Chinese tech companies’ public silence over the mass evictions shows an underlying truth about their position in China. Despite the economic growth, jobs and innovation they create, the tech companies remain reliant on the authoritarian government, and that limits their influence.

“Everybody understands that the government is in charge in China,” Liu Yang, a 25-year-old college graduate from the central city of Zhengzhou who went to Beijing this year to look for a programmer job, told me. “Companies don’t want to cause trouble.”

Mr. Liu was evicted from the apartment he shared with two roommates near Beijing’s tech center, Haidian, last week with only one day’s notice.

For the tech companies, the government is both overseer and customer. It provides business licenses and regulates expansion into new sectors, such as internet finance. Tech companies form partnerships with the government to develop censorship tools to block online content and facial recognition technologies to monitor citizens. E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding and social-media and games behemoth Tencent Holdings are offering up their data-crunching abilities to local governments to build “smart cities.”

Says a government-relations executive who has worked in the tech industry for many years, companies can’t afford to offend the new party secretary of Beijing, a protégé of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Thousands of migrants are estimated to have been evicted, many on short notice, as authorities inspect buildings in the aftermath of the fire in southern Beijing on Nov. 18 that killed 19 people, 17 of them migrant workers.

JD.com and Alibaba declined to say whether they have raised the evictions with the Beijing government. Alibaba says it is coordinating with its logistics partners to help affected workers and their families with temporary housing and other support and says its logistics affiliate hasn’t experienced any “significant disruption” to its service.

‘Everybody understands that the government is in charge in China. Companies don’t want to cause trouble.’ —Liu Yang, who went to Beijing this year to look for a programmer job

Anecdotally, services have been affected. Several shop owners at Alibaba’s Taobao Marketplace told me that some delivery companies are refusing to ship to Beijing because local couriers are in short supply and some warehouses are being closed. Taobao customers in the city complain of slower service and higher delivery fees.

The tech giants know they rely on migrant labor. In a social-media post on Monday, Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma thanked what he said were the three million couriers who delivered a billion parcels after the Nov. 11 online shopping extravaganza that is China’s equivalent of Cyber Monday. Behind the “miracle” of China’s delivery-service industry, he wrote, are the couriers “who work on windy and rainy days.”

JD.com founder and Chief Executive Richard Liu always refers to the company’s more than 65,000 delivery workers as “brothers” because, he told me two years ago, he wants to show them respect.

Mr. Liu, who was born in a poor village in eastern China, went to university in Beijing with money donated from neighbors. He told me that JD couriers with a few years of experience can make over $1,200 a month in Beijing, plus full benefits. That is considered good pay for blue-collar workers.

Migrants my colleagues and I spoke to this week aren’t expecting help. Some see in the government’s power a leveling effect on big companies.

“They’re just ordinary citizens like us,” says Nathan Wang, who works on user engagement at a Beijing-based internet startup. He is worried that his unheated studio apartment might be next to be torn down.

"WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump is consulting with advisers about whom he should tap as his next chief of staff, with John Kelly expected to depart the administration as early as this summer, possibly soon, according to people familiar with the matter.

The two front-runners for the job, the people said, are Nick Ayers, who serves as chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, and Mick Mulvaney, who heads the Office of Management and Budget as well as serving as acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Mr. Mulvaney dined with the president Wednesday evening, and Mr. Trump discussed the chief of staff position with him, according to a person familiar with the conversation.

Plans for Mr. Kelly’s exit aren’t final, the people said. Other aides have fallen out of favor with the president yet held on to jobs longer than expected as Mr. Trump gets more feedback on their performance.

The White House, asked about Mr. Kelly’s status, initially declined to comment. Later Thursday, after The Wall Street Journal report appeared online, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the president called the article “fake news” and that Mr. Kelly said “this was news to him.”

Mr. Kelly has told colleagues he doesn’t intend to stay in the role beyond his one-year mark, which is July 31. People close to the White House said that departure could come as early as this week or could follow the president’s mid-July trip to Europe, where he will attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit and meet with the leaders of the U.K. and Russia.

Newsletter Sign-up

One person close to the White House said Mr. Kelly doesn’t believe he can serve Mr. Trump well because the president has stopped listening to him. This person said Mr. Kelly no longer likes the job and doesn’t believe the president genuinely wants a chief of staff.

A complication is the Supreme Court vacancy created by Anthony Kennedy’s departure. Mr. Trump may need Mr. Kelly to help recruit, vet and shepherd through a Supreme Court nomination, this person said.

Mr. Kelly, a 68-year-old retired Marine general, came into the job with a mandate to impose discipline in a West Wing where many aides had easy access to the president and felt free to pursue policy initiatives that hadn’t been fully vetted. But in recent months, Mr. Kelly’s grip on West Wing operations has loosened. Some senior aides now report directly to the president, a departure from an early practice in which Mr. Kelly was the principal gatekeeper to the Oval Office.

The president has asked several advisers what they think about Mr. Kelly and how long he should stay in the role, said people familiar with the matter. Mr. Kelly’s predecessor, Reince Priebus, stayed on the job for six months.

Mr. Kelly traveled with the president this week to North Dakota and Wisconsin for a campaign rally, a fundraiser and a visit to a technology plant.

Some veterans of the Trump White House say the president chafes under the sort of hierarchical structure that Mr. Kelly sought to create, preferring to consult with friends and associates on his own timetable.

Steve Bannon, a former White House chief strategist, said that when Mr. Trump ran his real-estate business from Trump Tower, he had “no hierarchy” and a half-dozen people reporting to him directly.

“It’s been very obvious for the last four or five months that President Trump has run the White House with an organizational structure that has left Kelly in a ceremonial position,” Mr. Bannon said. “That’s the structure he’s most comfortable with and it’s coincided with some of his greatest accomplishments on trade, North Korea, and the economy. I would anticipate with Kelly’s departure that he would go with a structure where a chief of staff would only play a ceremonial role, if he appoints one at all,” he added. “That’s the structure that fits him best.”

The departure of Mr. Kelly, who served as Mr. Trump’s homeland security secretary before taking over for Mr. Priebus, could trigger more resignations as people loyal to him leave. That would accelerate what has already been record turnover at senior levels of the White House.

A year and a half into his presidency, Mr. Trump has presided over the highest turnover of any recent president at a comparable point, according to Martha Joynt Kumar, emeritus professor of political science at Towson University. Some 61% of people who held the rank of assistant to the president under Mr. Trump have left the job, versus 14% under Barack Obama, 5% for George W. Bush, 42% for Bill Clinton, 19% for George H.W. Bush and 29% for Ronald Reagan at this point in their administrations, according to Ms. Kumar’s research.

The discussions about a new chief of staff come as Mr. Trump prepares to fill another key administration role: communications adviser. The president on Wednesday met with former Fox News executive Bill Shine about heading that department, a job that has been left empty since longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks left the administration in March, people familiar with the meeting said.

Mr. Shine has expressed interest in the role, though he may serve as an adviser rather than take the formal role of communications director, the people said. A White House announcement is expected in the coming days.

Mr. Ayers has served as the vice president’s chief of staff for nearly a year, sworn in on the same day that Mr. Trump said he was tapping Mr. Kelly for the role. A longtime adviser to Mr. Pence, Mr. Ayers has at times clashed with senior advisers in the West Wing, who have accused him of trying to undercut the president, according to people familiar with the matter. Asked about the potential discord Mr. Ayers’s appointment could bring to the West Wing, one person close to the White House replied: “Whose problem is that?”

Mr. Mulvaney’s name has often been mentioned for the chief of staff job, and the former congressman was a contender for the position last summer, too, before Mr. Trump tapped Mr. Kelly.

“Mick serves at the pleasure of the president and is focused on his two full-time jobs. He does not have time for rumors, especially from unnamed sources,” an administrative official said.

Mr. Kelly’s departure would follow months of friction between him and the president, although both sought to tamp down speculation that Mr. Trump would appoint another chief of staff. Mr. Kelly has frequently complained about his job and working in the White House, including in a recent meeting with lawmakers.

At a Medal of Honor ceremony on Tuesday, the president singled out his chief of staff as a “special guy” but also cracked a joke about his age. As he touted the Medal of Honor recipient’s efforts during the 1945 Battle of the Bulge, Mr. Trump interrupted his speech—“That was a tough one, right?…Kelly was there.”

One person close to the White House took note of that moment, casting it as a message that Mr. Trump would like someone younger in the job.

While Mr. Trump bristled over Mr. Kelly’s protocols, some aides and friends found loopholes to get around the system, at times calling first lady Melania Trump and asking her to pass messages to her husband, according to people familiar with the matter.

The relationship hit a rough patch earlier this year, when Mr. Trump privately criticized his chief of staff for the handling of accusations of domestic assault against former staff secretary Rob Porter, who resigned in February after graphic photos emerged of the alleged abuse.

Mr. Kelly had initially defended Mr. Porter, vouching for his integrity publicly and privately. In his own public comments on the matter, Mr. Trump emphasized Mr. Porter’s denial of abuse without addressing his staff’s handling of the matter.

In March, shortly after Mr. Trump fired secretary of state Rex Tillerson, Mr. Kelly left aides with the impression that he might be next to be pushed out and that they should start looking for new jobs. But by the end of the week, the two had reached a truce, and Mr. Trump told advisers afterward that Mr. Kelly was “100% safe.”

"A woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were teenagers went public with her name for the first time on Sunday, injecting immediate uncertainty into Republicans’ push to quickly confirm the next high-court justice.

The public allegation by the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, in an article published by the Washington Post Sunday, threatened to alter the trajectory of a confirmation process that has been heading toward a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. A spokesman for the committee’s chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), said Sunday that the vote would proceed as scheduled, but hours later, Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.), who sits on the committee, said he wouldn’t vote for Judge Kavanaugh to advance to the full Senate until the committee had heard from Mrs. Ford.

“I would not vote yes until we hear more from the woman who’s come forward,” Mr. Flake said in an interview. With Republicans holding just a one-vote majority on the committee, a defection by Mr. Flake would prevent the panel from favorably advancing Judge Kavanaugh to the full Senate, where the GOP has a 51-49 majority. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) told Politico he also supported delaying the vote to hear from Mrs. Ford, while Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) told CNN she was discussing the matter with colleagues.

Mrs. Ford, in the Post article, said that when she and Judge Kavanaugh were teenagers at a party in the Washington, D.C., area, he and a friend pulled her into a bedroom. Judge Kavanaugh pinned her down on the bed, groped her and attempted to remove her clothing before she escaped, Mrs. Ford said in the article.

Mrs. Ford, who is a professor at Palo Alto University in California, described the episode as aggressive. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” she told the Post.

Judge Kavanaugh, 53 years old, denied the assertions when they began to surface, without the accuser’s name, last week. “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,” Judge Kavanaugh said in a statement released through the White House. “I did not do this back in high school or at any time.”

Efforts to reach Mrs. Ford weren’t successful. The White House didn’t change its stance after she came forward.

“On Friday, Judge Kavanaugh ‘categorically and unequivocally’ denied this allegation. This has not changed,” White House spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement Sunday. “Judge Kavanaugh and the White House both stand by that statement.”

It is unclear whether Mrs. Ford would testify before the committee, either in private or in public.

The outlines of Mrs. Ford’s allegation emerged publicly several days ago when Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she had reported a matter involving Judge Kavanaugh to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mrs. Feinstein didn’t initially name Mrs. Ford, saying the individual had requested confidentiality.

On Sunday, Mrs. Feinstein confirmed in a statement that Mrs. Ford was the person who had made the allegations.

“I support Mrs. Ford’s decision to share her story, and now that she has, it is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation,” Mrs. Feinstein said. “This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nominee.”

Mr. Flake, in his interview Sunday evening, added, “We said before that these allegations were anonymous and uncorroborated. That is no longer true.” Mr. Flake, who is retiring after this term, has occasionally criticized President Trump.

Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on Mr. Grassley to delay the panel’s vote. Democrats have pushed for weeks for a slower process, saying many documents relevant to Judge Kavanaugh’s background hadn’t been released.

Any slowdown of the Kavanaugh nomination would be a bitter pill for a Republican leadership that has banked on a swift confirmation to install him before the next court session begins in early October and safely ahead of November’s midterm elections. Judge Kavanaugh, nominated in July to succeed the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, is expected to shift the balance of the court further to the right, making his confirmation fight particularly high-stakes.

Taylor Foy, the Grassley spokesman, said earlier Sunday that Democrats should have brought the allegations to the Judiciary Committee earlier. Mrs. Feinstein has said she didn’t raise the matter earlier because Mrs. Ford was hesitant to come forward.

The judge has been expected to be approved on a party-line vote in the GOP-controlled Judiciary Committee. In the full Senate, he would need a simple majority to be confirmed. There, Mrs. Ford’s decision to speak publicly is likely to focus more attention on the two GOP senators whom Democrats have targeted as most likely to defect in a floor vote on Judge Kavanaugh: Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

Neither senator has raised serious concerns about Judge Kavanaugh, but both are strong supporters of women’s rights who Democrats believe might support a delay in the confirmation process.

The offices of Sens. Collins and Murkowski didn’t respond to a request for comment Sunday.

Mrs. Ford is a research psychologist at Palo Alto, where she teaches in consortium with Stanford University. A university spokeswoman didn’t reply to requests for more information.

She graduated from the all-girls Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Md., not far from the Georgetown Preparatory School Mr. Kavanaugh attended. A 2014 edition of Holton-Arms’ alumni magazine says Mrs. Ford is a professor of psychology and statistics and worked at Stanford since 1988. She was among thousands of mental-health professionals and researchers who signed onto a Physicians for Human Rights letter to the Trump administration in June denouncing the administration’s immigration policy that caused family separations at the U.S. border, according to a copy of the letter.

She also works as a biostatistician and has co-written more than 50 scientific books and publications, the alumni magazine said, noting that she is an “avid surfer, and she and her family spend a great deal of time surfing in the Santa Cruz and San Francisco areas.”

Mrs. Ford’s papers cover topics such as the relationship between childhood abuse and neglect and adult depression; post-traumatic growth after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001; and whether acupuncture is a useful treatment for depression during pregnancy.

Mrs. Ford, using her professional name, Christine Blasey, has made three donations since January 2017 totaling $42 to Act Blue, an online service that provides a one-stop donation platform used by Democrats seeking office.

Mrs. Ford provided several previously unreported details to the Post, saying she had discussed the alleged incident in 2012 when she and her husband, Russell Biddle Ford, were in couples therapy.

The therapist saved her notes, which describe Mrs. Ford recounting being assaulted by students “from an elitist boys’ school,” but didn’t name Judge Kavanaugh, the article said.

The therapist also noted that there were four boys involved, which, Mrs. Ford said in the Post interview, was the therapist’s error.

Mrs. Ford said she didn’t tell anyone about the incident at the time, worried that she would get in trouble with her parents for being at a party where teenagers were drinking. But she told the Post that the alleged assault had damaged her, hindered her ability to have healthy relationships with men and contributed to long-term anxiety issues.

Mrs. Ford also took a polygraph test administered by a former FBI agent and provided the results to the Post, which the newspaper said indicated she was being truthful when she said a statement summarizing her allegations was accurate.

"The new allied deterrent force for the Baltic region will be in place by May 2017, with some units arriving earlier, the head of the Western alliance’s military committee said Sunday.

Military leaders from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, gathering in Split, Croatia, this weekend, discussed the deployment of the force of up to 4,000 personnel, its rules of engagement, and its command and control.

Czech Army Gen. Petr Pavel, who leads the NATO military committee, said the battle groups will be arriving at different times in the first half of 2017. The U.S. force, of about 1,000 soldiers, will come from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment based in Vilseck, Germany, and is due to arrive in Poland by April, U.S. officials said.

In its July summit in Warsaw, NATO approved a new multinational force to be stationed in Poland and the Baltic states, aimed at deterring Russian aggression in the region. Eastern European allies have been worried about the possibility of a rising threat from Russia since Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

In Croatia, the NATO chiefs of defense—including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford—discussed the rules of engagement the force would operate under. The rules will differ by each country, reflecting differences in the situation and agreements with the host nations.

While Gen. Pavel wouldn't outline the rules, he said they would be altered from those the current international forces in the region are operating under, designed to allow the new NATO forces to move from a peacetime footing to a crisis situation rapidly.

“With these four battle groups, we are not talking about exclusively about a training presence,” he said. “This force is to serve as a deterrent and if necessary as a fighting force. The rules will be different.”

Some of the troops participating in the deterrent force—both from the NATO contributing countries and the host nations—have been training at the U.S. Army facility in Grafenwoehr, Germany. Forces have been dusting off Cold War-era knowledge about defenses, as well as studying the electronic warfare techniques used by Russian-backed forces in Ukraine.

NATO military leaders will present proposals for the command of the new units at a gathering of alliance defense ministers in October, Gen. Pavel said.

Gen. Pavel said the new NATO force in the Baltic is likely to be overseen by a Polish division headquarters that is supplemented by international officers. U.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the top NATO commander, will have ultimate control of the new NATO force.

In addition to the U.S. battalion in Poland, Germany will send forces to Lithuania, Canada will send troops to Latvia and the British will have a battle group in Estonia. Other nations, including Norway, Denmark and France are supplementing those forces.

“There are many strands of work,” Gen. Pavel said. “We are trying to come up with the big picture so we are assured the measures we are taking are well coordinated, mutually supportive and we are not working in different directions.”

"BEALE AIR FORCE BASE, Calif.—Six decades after the U-2 flew its first mission, the military is trying to harness artificial-intelligence technology to enhance the venerable spy plane’s combat reconnaissance capabilities.

U.S. Air Force reconnaissance experts have enlisted Stanford University engineering and business students to develop advanced computer programs to analyze the old-style Kodak film currently used by U-2s over Afghanistan, Iraq, Korea, Syria and other hot zones.

The U-2 spy plane has been in service for more than 60 years and still flies missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. WSJ's Michael Phillips got a rare opportunity to fly to the edge of space and explore why America's oldest working spy plane is still soaring above 70,000 feet.

If successful, computers would quickly scan miles of U-2 film and count cars, airplanes, motorcycles, buildings and even individual people, tasks now performed painstakingly by analysts using eye loupes and illuminated screens.

“Our analysts are already saturated with data—too much imagery, too few analysts, and too little time,” says U.S. Air Force Col. Jason Brown, commander of the 480th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing. “Imagine if an algorithm could sweep through the data to cue analysts on potential areas of concern. Airmen could spend less time searching and more time making sense of the things they see.”

The U-2 spy plane first became operational in 1956 under the aegis of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Air Force U-2 operations began the following year. In 1960, U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down while taking photographs over the Soviet Union, sparking an international incident. In 1962, U.S. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson unveiled U-2 images at the United Nations to prove the Soviets had installed missiles in Cuba.

Six decades later, updated U-2 planes—part of a 30-plane fleet now flown by U.S. Air Force pilots—conduct combat missions over Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, as well as performing humanitarian surveillance. The planes brought back images of floodwaters unleashed by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 and of damage caused by the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

U-2s can carry modern electronic sensors—infrared or electro-optical devices, for instance—mostly used when analysts know roughly where their quarry is located.

But wet-film cameras still outperform other surveillance gear by delivering crisp images from above 70,000 feet, where the pilot can see land for 250 miles in any direction. The cameras can distinguish objects just 8 inches apart, providing sufficient clarity for analysts to read the identification numbers on the wing of a parked airplane or count the number of people at a camp.

“You can cover almost all of California in four hours,” says one senior U-2 pilot, who goes by the call-sign Sharkey. “It maps the entire terrain.”

U-2s photograph all of Afghanistan every month or so.

A typical flight generates a 200-pound, two-mile-long roll of film, which is shipped by FedEx to Beale Air Force Base. Technicians there develop the film, and analysts search for information that could prove useful for longer-term military planning.

Given time and staff constraints, however, humans can read only about 5% of the images the spy planes capture. “If you’ve got the whole state of California, how do you look at all those images?” says Command Master Sgt. Ian Eishen, of the Air Force’s 9th Intelligence Squadron. “You don’t.”

The Air Force is hoping that computers can learn to scan digitized images of the wet film and identify and count cars, trucks, boats, planes, motorcycles, buildings and people on the ground below.

If the artificial-intelligence effort is successful, for instance, the computer could spot and measure an increase in activity in a particular area, freeing up human analysts to think about whether that activity constitutes a threat to allied ground forces or an opportunity for offensive action.

Even from an altitude above 70,000 feet, the U-2’s cameras and film produce images with enough clarity to read identification numbers on the wing of a parked airplane or count the number of people at a camp. Photo: Michael M. Phillips/The Wall Street Journal

“Now the analyst can figure out why” the activity is taking place, says Sgt. Eishen.

Images taken by advanced digital sensors are usually classified. The U-2’s film camera isn’t classified, and neither are the pictures it takes. That allows the Air Force to share them with engineering students, even those from foreign countries.

This spring, Stanford students working with Air Force experts developed a prototype of an automated system to read the U-2 imagery, through a class called Hacking 4 Defense. The Air Force expects to test the system in the coming months.

The defense class is now offered at 11 universities, from Georgetown to Boise State, and each group of students undertakes its own defense-related technology challenge. Students at the University of Southern California are working on artificial-intelligence technology to identify roadside booby-traps, such as the ones that have devastated U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“The U-2 problem is very similar: How do you use artificial intelligence to look at a massive amount of data and identify objects?” says Pete Newell, a retired Army colonel who teaches the course at Stanford.

"The victory of Kara Eastman over former Rep. Brad Ashford, the Democratic Party establishment’s favored candidate in a Nebraska primary Tuesday, has left the party at risk of being less competitive in a district that may be key to winning a majority in the House of Representatives in November.

Her upset win in an Omaha House district underscores the limits of often-cautious Democratic Party leaders’ influence in primary elections at a time when their voters and liberal grass-roots activists are hungry for a more confrontational approach.

Ms. Eastman, a 46-year-old nonprofit executive, campaigned on instituting a single-payer health-care system. In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting massacre last October, she told the Omaha World-Herald that Congress should consider a constitutional amendment “to define what bearing arms means” under the Second Amendment.

On Wednesday, Ms. Eastman said in an interview that she is for “common-sense gun-safety laws” including banning assault weapons and instituting background checks for new gun purchases. She said she didn’t recall proposing changing the Constitution to limit the Second Amendment.

“I’ve given a lot of interviews and I don’t remember that one,” she said.

Her bold positioning was a contrast to Mr. Ashford, a centrist who was on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s “Red-to-Blue” list of endorsed candidates. The DCCC has also been subsidizing two Nebraska Democratic Party staffers in a bid to boost voter turnout in the district.

Officials from both parties say Mr. Ashford’s defeat likely makes a Democratic victory in Nebraska against first-term GOP Rep. Don Bacon—who ousted Mr. Ashford in 2016—more difficult for Democrats.

“Kara Eastman is going to have to convince the voters that even though she may be more liberal than the district that it doesn’t really matter,” Mr. Ashford said. “What really matters is the inability of the Republican majority and the president to solve the problems that are affecting people.”

Mr. Ashford, who served a single term in Congress before losing a 2016 re-election bid to Mr. Bacon, said Wednesday that Democratic primary voters rejected his centrist message.

“If you’re mad about government, you can yell and scream but in the end we can fix it,” Mr. Ashford said. “That can only be done in the center. It can’t be done on the extremes.”

Republicans in Washington celebrated the Nebraska result. The National Republican Congressional Committee released polling showing Mr. Bacon with a 10-percentage point lead over Ms. Eastman. Mr. Bacon led Mr. Ashford by two points in a hypothetical matchup, the NRCC polls showed.

The DCCC hasn’t polled the Eastman-Bacon matchup, an official said.

Mr. Bacon said Wednesday it is “hard for me to say” whether Ms. Eastman’s primary victory makes his general election path easier.

“She’s too far to the left, but she’s going to bring some enthusiasm from her base” that Mr. Ashford wouldn’t, Mr. Bacon said.

Ms. Eastman rejected the idea that she is too liberal for the district.

“I’ve run on messages that I believe in and that I know represent the values of the people in the district,” she said. “The idea of providing health care for everybody, we can afford it. … And that’s what the people at the doors have told me they want.”

"The forensic medical services morgue in Acapulco is often full, even though it has five refrigerators which can hold approximately 400 bodies at a time.

The forensic medical services morgue in Acapulco is often full, even though it has five refrigerators which can hold approximately 400 bodies at a time.

ACAPULCO, Mexico—It was the beginning of just another day in one of the world’s most murderous places.

Cristian Sabino was sitting on a plastic chair by this beach resort’s central market when a gunman walked up and shot him five times. As the 22-year-old dropped to the ground, the assailant fired a final bullet to the head and walked away.

Six more people would be killed that day in Acapulco, including a cabdriver who was hacked to pieces. Death is so much part of the landscape that once police cordoned off the area around Mr. Sabino’s body, some patrons at a nearby rotisserie chicken restaurant stayed to finish their meals.

Acapulco’s days as a tourist resort with a touch of Hollywood glamour seem long ago. In a city of 800,000, 953 people were violently killed last year, more than in Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Portugal and the Netherlands put together.

There were more than 900 murders in Acapulco last year. Violence is so pervasive in this city, once a premier Mexican tourist destination, that criminology has become a thriving new profession. Photo/Video: Jake Nicol/The Wall Street Journal

It’s not just Mexico. There is a murder crisis across much of Latin America and the Caribbean, which today is the world’s most violent region. Every day, more than 400 people are murdered there, a yearly tally of about 145,000 dead.

With just 8% of the world’s population, Latin America accounts for roughly a third of global murders. It is also the only region where lethal violence has grown steadily since 2000, according to United Nations figures.

Nearly one in every four murders around the world takes place in just four countries: Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico and Colombia. Last year, a record 63,808 people were murdered in Brazil. Mexico also set a record at 31,174, with murders so far this year up another 20%.

The 2016 tally in China, according to the U.N.: 8,634. For the entire European Union: 5,351. The United States: 17,250.

Crime slows development and spurs migration to the U.S. Violence costs Latin America 3% of annual economic output, on average, twice the level of developed countries, according to a 2016 study by the Inter-American Development Bank. The price tag for crime, which the bank put at between $115 billion and $261 billion, is comparable to the total regional spending on infrastructure, or the income of the poorest third of Latin Americans.

In recent years, growing numbers of families from Central America, including women and children, have fled to the U.S. because of horrific violence. Gangs such as MS-13 and Barrio 18 enforce a reign of terror, dictating even where people can go to school or get medical care. El Salvador’s murder rate of 83 per 100,000 people in 2016—the world’s highest—was nearly 17 times that of the U.S.

A new study by Vanderbilt University shows that the strongest factor in predicting whether someone emigrates from Honduras and El Salvador isn’t age, gender or economic situation, but whether they had been victimized by crime multiple times in the past year. A World Bank study found that nearly a quarter of children in one Honduran municipality suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder due to violence.

At the Acapulco morgue, bodies pile up faster than workers can process them. The morning after Mr. Sabino’s murder, there were already three new victims lying on gurneys awaiting autopsy. A few feet away, 356 bodies that remain unclaimed or unidentified were stuffed into five refrigeration units. The smell of death hung in the air.

“We never catch up,” says Ben Yehuda Martínez, the top forensic official for the state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located. “While we’re trying to clear the first set of bodies, another set of bodies arrives.”

Just this week, Mr. Martínez’s counterpart in the state of Jalisco was fired after it emerged that two trailer trucks filled with more than 150 cadavers each were roaming Mexico’s second-largest city of Guadalajara for days because the local morgue was too full. Officials admitted the trucks contained corpses after neighbors complained of the smell and dripping blood.

Mr. Martínez, 60, has seen it all. His very first case as a young forensic specialist in the nearby city of Iguala was the 1997 autopsy of two doctors who had botched a plastic surgery operation, accidentally killing drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Their bodies, encased in cement, were found on the side of the Mexico City-to-Acapulco highway. Mr. Martínez’s verdict: They were both asphyxiated with a tourniquet.

Mr. Martínez says he hasn’t ever become used to seeing children killed. “Before, criminals never killed kids. But now I do autopsies on 7- or 8-year-olds,” he says. He teaches chemistry and biology at a local college. “I’ve had the shock of having to autopsy quite a few of my former students.”

Up to 10% of the cadavers that arrive are never claimed. No one files a police report or bothers to pick up the body. Other times, there is no way to identify a corpse: “We sometimes get only a leg or a head to work with,” he says.

Latin America accounts for 43 of the 50 most murderous cities, including the entire top 10, according to the Igarapé Institute, a Brazilian think tank that focuses on violence. South Africa and the U.S.—where St. Louis ranks No. 19—are the only countries outside Latin America that crack the top 50.

At current murder rates, if you live in Acapulco (or Caracas, Venezuela, or San Salvador) for 70 years, there is a roughly 1-in-10 chance you will get murdered.

Between 2000 and 2017, roughly 2.5 million people were murdered in Latin America and the Caribbean, as if Chicago were wiped out. That compares with about 900,000 killed in the armed conflicts of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan combined, according to U.N. figures and estimates by groups like Iraq Body Count.

During that same period, all the world’s terrorist attacks killed 243,000 people, according to the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database.

“Large swaths of Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico and Venezuela are experiencing a war in all but name,” says Robert Muggah, head of the Igarapé Institute.

The vast majority of victims and perpetrators are young men, killed mostly by gunshot. A vital Twitter feed in Rio de Janeiro is “Onde Tem Tiroteo,” or “Where’s the Shootout?” which tells motorists which parts of the city to avoid. Some recent entries: “A grenade was thrown on the pedestrian bridge near Zuzu Angel Tunnel.” “Shots on 2nd Street in Rocinha, police base under shooting attack.”

Shockingly, 1,379 babies under one year of age died violently in Brazil between 2000 and 2015, according to government statistics. Nearly 30,000 victims in Brazil were over 60 years old.

Gabriela Victoria's daughter Erica was kidnapped and murdered by long-time acquaintances from her Acapulco neighborhood.

Mexico’s murder tally may be underreported because many victims are tossed into unmarked graves, burned or put through sugar-cane grinders. In Tijuana, Santiago Meza confessed to dissolving more than 300 people in acid for a local cartel, earning the nickname “Pozolero,” or soup maker. The state of Coahuila, once under the control of the hyperviolent Zetas drug cartel, holds some 103,000 bone fragments belonging to unidentified bodies.

The sheer number of the missing could outnumber better-known cases of “disappeared” in Latin America’s sometimes bloody history, including Argentina’s Dirty War against leftists in the late 1970s.

Mexico has become a nation of unmarked graves where a small army of grieving mothers financed by bake sales search for their missing children. Their technology: They hire construction workers to hammer steel rods 6 feet into the ground, and then sniff the ends. If it smells of death, then it’s probably an unmarked grave. The government gives little support.

“It’s an interminable search,” says Guadalupe Contreras, one such searcher. “Today you find 20. Tomorrow, they bury another 20 somewhere else.” This month, the state of Veracruz discovered a mass grave with 168 skulls.

While murder rates are falling in most of the world, in Latin America the number of murders has grown about 3.7% a year since 2000, three times faster than the population, according to the Igarapé Institute. The region’s murder rate, at about 24 per 100,000 right now, will hit 35 per 100,000 by 2030 if the trend isn’t reversed.

Crime affects everyday life. About half of respondents in Latin America said they stopped going out at night, while more than 1-in-10 said they had moved due to the fear of violence, according to a survey from the U.N. Considering Latin America’s population, that’s more than 62 million people who felt the need to change homes.

Once the party spot of choice for the wealthy and famous, Acapulco has descended into disrepair and despair.

How did it get this bad?

Latin America was colonized violently and had bloody wars of independence. It has the world’s biggest gap between rich and poor, fueling resentment. Large parts of the economy are “informal,” street markets and family-run businesses that operate outside government control and pay no taxes, creating a culture of skirting the law. It has powerful groups of organized crime like Mexican drug cartels, and weak states riddled with corruption.

Demographics play a role: Latin America has more young people than most other regions, making for too many young men chasing too few quality jobs. And it has weak educational systems. Only 27% of Brazilians aged 25 or older have completed high school, according to government figures.

Much of Latin America also urbanized rapidly without services such as schooling and policing, creating belts of excluded groups around cities. Migration may have made matters worse. The percentage of single-parent homes in Mexico and Central America has grown rapidly over the past 20 years.

Latin America is also awash in guns, most of them held illegally. Nearly 78% of murders in Central America between 2000 and 2015 were caused by guns, compared with a global average of 32%, according to the Igarapé Institute. (In the U.S., it is around 73%.)

These factors create vicious cycles. Laura Chioda, a researcher at the World Bank, found that as many as 40% of young people in Honduras suffer from some form of depression due to the violence. “Now, imagine them at school,” she asks. “Can you teach calculus to someone with that level of trauma?” Many drop out and join the informal economy, where they won’t have a salary, training or career prospects. “Once there, they find this parallel structure of crime that provides jobs, services and an identity,” she says.

Marcelo Bergman, a sociologist who runs the Latin America Violence Research Center in Buenos Aires, thinks the informal economy plays a role. He says much of rising income at a time of economic growth among the region’s poor since 2000 went to consumption in the informal economy, creating more demand for stolen car parts, knockoff clothing and pirated movies. That gave more power to the mafias that supply them.

Latin America’s powerful mafias come from two accidents of geography: One is sitting next to the world’s biggest market for illegal drugs, the U.S., and the other is being the only region in the world to grow the coca plant, the main ingredient in cocaine, which remains among the world’s most profitable drugs. Organized crime accounts for about two-thirds of Mexico’s murders, experts say.

Mexico’s Independence Day celebrations on the night of Sept. 15 were marred when gunmen dressed as mariachi singers entered the city’s fabled Garibaldi plaza and gunned down five people, allegedly in a dispute over local drug sales.

Organized crime doesn’t explain all the violence, however. In Colombia, for instance, it accounts for anywhere from a quarter to half of crimes, government officials estimate. Latin America also has high rates of interpersonal and family violence. Colombian officials say the most murderous day of every year in Colombia is Mother’s Day, when revelers get drunk. Next on the list: New Year’s and Christmas.

Latin America wasn’t always the most murderous region in the world. In the 1950s, Singapore and Caracas had very similar murder rates, between 6 to 10 per 100,000 residents, according to Manuel Eisner, who studies historical levels of violence at the Violence Research Centre in Cambridge, U.K.

At the time, Singapore suffered from gangs, prostitution, drug trafficking and corruption. But after independence in 1962, authoritarian Lee Kwan Yew enforced rule of law, boosted education, and created a culture of working hard and achievement, and ensured social integration. “It wasn’t all coercion—there was a caring element,” says Mr. Eisner.

Nowadays, Singapore’s murder rate is 0.4 per 100,000 residents. In Caracas, the government doesn’t bother to count. The nongovernmental Venezuelan Violence Observatory estimates the country’s murder rate is roughly 110 per 100,000—about 34,000 a year.

Not all of Latin America has this problem. Chile’s murder rate of 3.6 per 100,000 sits well below the U.S. The state of Yucatán in Mexico has a similarly low murder rate. Even within cities, crime is concentrated: Half of all crime in Bogotá, Colombia, takes place in just 2% of the city. That makes good policing crucial to lowering violence.

But with some exceptions such as Chile, and increasingly Colombia, Latin America has largely failed to build strong legal institutions. Less than 20% of homicides in the region are solved. In Mexico, the figure is below 10%. Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office, the country’s version of the FBI, investigated more than 600 murder cases linked to organized crime in the past eight years. It won a guilty verdict in just two. That kind of impunity literally means that you can get away with murder.

When impunity is high, people take justice into their own hands. In mid-May, locals in the town of Miravalle in southern Mexico grabbed three men accused of holding up an elderly woman and burned them alive. No arrests were made in the case, state officials say.

A 10-year study of murder cases in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte found that police investigations lasted an average of 500 days, the average trial lasted 10 years and in a quarter of the cases the statute of limitations ran out—allowing the suspect to go free. Some 7% of suspects were slain before their sentence was handed out, in many cases by families of victims tired of waiting for justice.

Latin American prisons, the most overcrowded in the world, breed violence. Wardens have little control. The murder rate in Latin American prisons is 16 per 100,000—by far the world’s highest, according to U.N. figures. In two of the most chaotic prison systems—in Venezuela and Brazil—hundreds of prisoners die in gang fights each year and warlord inmates run vast drug-trafficking outfits that, on the outside, control swaths of territory.

The prison system is so weak that Colombia’s Pablo Escobar was allowed to build his own jail in the early 1990s, and Mexican kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman escaped twice from a maximum-security prison.

The spread of democracy in the 1990s across the region has had a perverse effect. Authoritarian states have an easier time controlling organized crime and violence. Many parts of Latin America got democracy before the rule of law; parts of Asia got the rule of law without democracy. Cuba, the hemisphere’s lone communist state, has a homicide rate estimated at about 4 per 100,000 residents.

Democracy in places such as Mexico disrupted existing arrangements between governments and organized crime that allowed for a pax mafiosa, says Eduardo Guerrero, a Mexican violence researcher. State governors would allow drug gangs to ferry narcotics to the U.S. in exchange for money and a promise to keep violence in check, not sell drugs near schools and reinvest some of the profits locally. The marketplace for votes upset those arrangements.

“None of these governors had bothered to build capable police forces because they relied on these arrangements,” he says. “But when the arrangements broke apart, they didn’t have any way to control the violence.”

In many ways, Acapulco is a perfect metaphor for Latin America’s broader failures. It is a place of stunning beauty spoiled by the same factors that fuel violence across the region: inequality, rapid and unplanned urbanization, lack of good institutions from education to police, deeply rooted corruption and an anything-goes attitude to the law.

Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra and John Wayne were regulars here during the resort’s heyday in the 1940s and 1950s. Two American presidents—John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton—made it their honeymoon destination. Later on, for more daring tourists, Acapulco was the place they could do what they couldn’t back home. Marijuana and cocaine were easily available at discos and from taxi drivers, and prostitution thrived, with brothels sitting just a block from the main strip.

“Acapulco was a place where tourists were allowed to do anything. So it’s not that surprising that locals also began to view the place as a city where there were no rules,” says Elisabet Sabartes, a Spanish journalist who is writing a book on the city’s violence. During the four years she has lived there, five acquaintances have been murdered.

As the drug war escalated, the tourist-dependent economy of Acapulco quickly declined and many large construction projects were left unfinished or abandoned.

Despite opium fields in the nearby mountains, violence here only took off in 2006, when the drug gang that controlled Guerrero split into two rival groups. It got worse in 2011, when Mexican marines killed kingpin Arturo Beltran Leyva, prompting further splits. Nowadays, more than two dozen rival gangs fight for control of the city’s criminal market.

Many no longer have the clout to carry out big drug deals, so they turn to other activities such as extortion. Practically every business in Acapulco pays. Father Jesus Mendoza, a priest, says some of his colleagues get extorted, and gangs have stolen church bells from some parishes to sell for the copper. The effect on business has been predictably bad. No new hotel has been built in more than a decade.

“The only thriving businesses around here are funeral homes,” says Laura Caballero, the head of a shopkeeper association. She closed her eight shops along the city’s main beachfront avenue three years ago due to monthly extortion demands that reached $800 per store. She says several fellow shopkeepers who refused to pay were killed.

The police have been incapable of stopping the violence. In 2014, most members of Acapulco’s police force were given a battery of tests to see if they were honest, including psychological profiles and lie-detector tests. Some 700 out of 1,100 failed.

When the Acapulco mayor at the time tried to fire the cops who failed, the entire police force walked off the job for 11 months. He backtracked. During the walkout, crime actually fell slightly. Scores of police who failed the test are still on the job, say security experts and former policemen.

In 2014, Mexico was outraged when local police in Iguala, another city in the same state, handed over 43 college kids to a drug gang, who are believed to have incinerated the teens. Most experts think the students accidentally commandeered a passenger bus that had heroin on it heading for the U.S., and police, in the pay of a local drug gang, thought the kids belonged to a rival cartel.

Acapulco’s police chief, Max Sedano, failed his recent lie-detector test, according to a local opposition-party congressman, Ricardo Mejia. Mr. Sedano, who remains in his post, told local journalists he didn’t know if he failed the test. The tests, usually done by federal officials, are confidential, and by law only the municipalities can fire their own officials. Mr. Sedano declined to be interviewed for this article.

“It’s not right that the police here aren’t in charge. The cartels are in charge,” says a 17-year veteran of Acapulco’s police force who quit in disgust last year.

There is a saying in Acapulco: If you want to be an old cop, look the other way.

In the hours after Mr. Sabino was murdered in Acapulco’s market recently, a local detective turned up, wearing a crocodile-skin belt and dark glasses. He asked no questions of witnesses. After the body was picked up by a forensic team, the detective left.

The violence in Acapulco has created a dystopia where social norms have broken down. Growing numbers of children drop out of school. Fewer go to church. Many hit men and teens worship La Santa Muerte, the cult of death represented by a grim reaper. A less toxic version is St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes. Mr. Sabino’s body had a tattoo of St. Jude, according to the autopsy report.

Perhaps the most notorious crime in Acapulco in recent years was the kidnap and murder of at least 10 teenagers by a gang of students who attended a local university. The gang targeted acquaintances, including classmates and friends from high school. One gang member had his own girlfriend abducted and killed. Members of the gang, after collecting ransom money and still killing their hostages, would even go to their victims’ funerals and mourn with the parents.

“What kinds of people do these things?” asked Elsa Ceballos, whose 19-year-old son was strangled by the kidnap gang.

At an Acapulco criminology college called Centro Forense, nearly every student in a ballistics class raises their hand when asked if they have been affected by violence. Conin Pascual’s father was killed. Luis Rodríguez’s cousin, a cabdriver, was hacked to pieces.

Carlos Kevin, 19, saw his first dead bodies at age 13, when he arrived at his middle school and there were two mangled bodies on the street.

“There are no cops in our neighborhoods and when there is a killing, they don’t want to investigate,” said Anitxa Gutierrez, who was 14 when a shootout left bullet holes in her family’s living room.

Santiago García, an eighth-grade teacher, says he tries to teach the students values in a society where social norms are breaking down. He also teaches them boxing so they can manage their anger.

Santiago García teaches his students boxing to give them an outlet for their frustrations.

“In the past, when kids got a failing grade, parents would ask how they could help. Now, I’ve had parents threaten to kill me or hire a hit man if I don’t pass their children,” he says.

Mr. García says between 30 and 40 kids didn’t return for this school year, in large part because their parents were threatened, a family member had already been killed, or the kids were being forced by gangs to sell drugs at the school. In many cases, the families simply left Acapulco.

Across the street from Mr. García’s middle school stands a pink house that was used by a gang to hold hostages. One day, during school hours, it was raided by marines, who pulled out several human remains. On another recent morning, a sixth-grader entered school crying, saying he had just found his uncle’s dead body outside the school gates.

“We ask the kids, where do you see yourselves in 20 years, and some say, ‘Carrying an AK-47!’ ” says Mr. García. Locals share videos of killings posted by local gangs. One recent video showed a teen being sliced open and his beating heart taken out.

Javier Morlett is an Acapulco native who knows the city better than anyone. His father was mayor in the 1960s and Mr. Morlett ran both the city’s airport and port at various stages in his career. In 2012, his 21-year-old daughter, who was studying at Mexico’s leading public university in Mexico City, was abducted. After an agonizing two-year search, he found her remains. The crime was never solved.

“I don’t think we can solve this,” he says of the violence. “This place was paradise, but we’ve turned it into an inferno.”

Historically an area where wealthy Americans would have their yachts repaired, Playa Manzanillo has now become known for the bodies that wash up on its shores, victims of Mexico's drug violence.

"HONG KONG—A high-speed rail station that opened Sunday promises more-rapid journeys between the financial hub and mainland China, but brings Beijing’s legal reach into Hong Kong for the first time, fanning concerns about the absorption of the semiautonomous territory into the mainland.

The almost $11 billion project—delayed for several years amid costly overruns—brings closer to fruition China’s plan to merge 11 cities in its Southern belt into one big economic cluster called the “Greater Bay Area.” Later this year, a bridge—the world’s longest cross-sea structure—will open, connecting Hong Kong to the Chinese city of Zhuhai and neighboring Macau, the world’s largest gambling hub.

Together, government officials here say the two new infrastructure links will make trading, logistics and commuting easier. The railway will also connect Hong Kong by bullet train to China’s domestic high-speed network, the world’s biggest and celebrated for stoking the nation’s rapid economic growth.

The trains, with names such as Harmony and Vibrant Express, run most frequently between cities in Southern China. About a hundred trains are scheduled to depart daily. It will be the fastest way to reach China’s tech hub of Shenzhen from Hong Kong, which houses the Asia headquarters of banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley . All around the new station, Bank of China advertisements touted cross-border financial services.

The trains connect to 44 destinations in China, including the capital city of Beijing. The 9-hour trip to China’s capital, at HK$1,237 ($158.40) in the lowest class, is about the same cost as a low-cost flight. Like the arrangement on the Eurostar train which shuttles passengers between London and Paris, travelers will now have their documents checked and processed by both Hong Kong and Chinese immigration officers before boarding the train, removing the need to go through border control upon arrival to the Chinese destination.

But the hundreds of mainland law enforcers who will be stationed inside the rail hub in the city’s West Kowloon district have stoked a political storm in the city, with China’s influence in Hong Kong rising since failed mass protests in 2014 to demand more democracy.

In December 2017, China’s top legislative body endorsed the plan to locate both Hong Kong and mainland officials in the station.

The unprecedented legal arrangement effectively means a strip of land in the heart of the former British colony will be governed under China’s national laws. One of the city’s top lawyers’ groups, the Hong Kong Bar Association, opposed the move as undermining semiautonomy Beijing guaranteed the city for 50 years when it resumed sovereignty in 1997.

In an opening ceremony Saturday, Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam thanked the body—the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress—for providing “a firm legal basis” for the arrangement, while touting the economic benefits the new transport network would provide to the city.

Many in the city have been chilled by Beijing’s growing power since two high-profile incidents—the disappearance of a bookseller and a Chinese billionaire from Hong Kong who later turned up in police custody on the mainland—raised concerns that Chinese law enforcers were taking increasingly intrusive actions to exercise their version of the law in Hong Kong.

“It’s like a Trojan horse infiltrating the city through the belly of the railway system,” said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker who also represents the district where the station stands. “It’s part of China’s endgame: From now they don’t need to kidnap anyone, they just need to lure people to the train station.”

Still, crowds of residents have welcomed the train and the convenience it brings. On Sunday hundreds lined up at different counter windows to check-in and buy tickets. Some took selfies inside the sunlit station with panoramic views of Hong Kong’s skyline.

Ho Kah Nai, a doctor, was lining up at the station on Sunday for a ticket to Shenzhen the following week. He said the train links would make it easier for medics offering services across the border to commute.

“I normally travel to the mainland once or twice a year,” he said. “But I expect to go much more frequently because of the railway.”

"IRVINE, Calif.—In her district’s biggest city and across its conservative bastions, Republican U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters is facing criticism over the GOP tax overhaul bill that she voted for last month. The bill might increase taxes for many of her constituents, rather than lower them.

Under pressure from frustrated supporters, she is now working to modify the bill to ease the blow as lawmakers try to hash out a compromise with a measure passed by the Senate.

Three of California’s 14 House Republicans voted against the bill last month, citing measures that would curb or even eliminate some key deductions used widely by Californians. Mrs. Walters’s support for the bill, by contrast, has drawn scrutiny from some at a tense moment for the state’s Republicans, ahead of competitive midterm elections next year.

“I’m not going to vote for a Democrat, but am I going to vote for a Republican that is going to raise my taxes? That is the question,” said Jeffrey Lalloway, a divorce lawyer and Republican member of Irvine’s City Council.

Stephen Miller, a registered Republican until 2016—he switched to independent ahead of the presidential election—said he was furious with Mrs. Walters’s endorsement of the bill. A former corporate tax attorney in Irvine, Mr. Miller created a spreadsheet calculator for Orange County residents to estimate how much in taxes they would owe if the bill passes.

“When I step back at 30,000 feet, I see a bill that is taxing the rising middle class—people going to college, getting ahead by their own labor—at higher rates in order to lower taxes on income from existing wealth,” said Mr. Miller, 45 years old. “I’m trying to spread information about this tax bill. I think that is most effective in switching independents, swing voters.”

Analysts have said the GOP tax bill would give most people a modest tax break, at least in the first few years. But those benefits would be curbed in districts like Mrs. Walters’s, where some affluent residents could be pinched by new limits on deductions for state and local taxes, known as SALT, and mortgage interest that are still being negotiated.

In an interview Tuesday, Mrs. Walters acknowledged the tax bill’s limits to the SALT deduction sparked some worries and said she was pushing for changes to give constituents more flexibility. Currently, both the House and Senate bill only preserve the property-tax deduction up to $10,000.

Though she isn’t part of the formal group of negotiations, “I’ve been making my feelings known what I think is important in a final bill,” she said.

Mrs. Walters also said she is focused on trying to boost the mortgage-interest deduction, which the House voted to limit to loans totaling up to $500,000, down from $1 million in current law, which is also the level preserved by the Senate.

In 2015, the median property value in Orange County, where Mrs. Walters’s 45th district sits, was $625,300, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In the last quarter, the average price paid for a home in most neighborhoods in Mrs. Walters’s inland district hovered around or above the county median, according to data from CoreLogic , a data analytics firm.

“I’d like to see us come to a compromise on that,” potentially at around $750,000, said Mrs. Walters, who was first elected to Congress in 2014.

Without a change, people in Orange County worry that the measure would spur higher mortgage-interest rates, suppress home buying or bring other knock-on economic effects.

“You basically are creating a disincentive for people to buy those more expensive houses. It will have an impact on our real-estate prices here,” said Max Chao, continuing lecturer in accounting, tax, and law at the University of California, Irvine.

In addition to raising taxes on some upper middle-income professionals such as teachers, dentists, and engineers, the bill may also increase taxes on the highest-income brackets—including people like lawyers or bankers who, in some cases, are paying off student loans or starting and supporting families.

High-paid lawyers in Orange County are calling the bill the “millionaires-subsidizing-billionaires tax plan,” in a nod to some of their own clients, who would benefit from lower taxes on businesses and estates.

Orange County is known as a Republican center in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, but Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won Mrs. Walters’s district last year with 49% of the vote, even as the incumbent congresswoman was re-elected with nearly 59%. Mrs. Walters already has several Democratic challenges for what should be a competitive race next year.

Of the 23 GOP-controlled House districts won by Mrs. Clinton in 2016, Mrs. Walters’s has the fourth-highest percentage of tax filers taking the state and local deduction, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis of IRS data.

“People are obviously concerned about the state and local tax income deduction,” she said. “That makes it difficult for somebody like myself.”

On Tax Plan, Many Questions In several neighborhoods in California’s 45th District, from upscale Mission Viejo to more blue-collar Lake Forest, many people said they weren’t sure how the revised tax laws would affect their families. Realtors and tax accountants said they were surprised they weren’t being flooded with questions from clients. Jackie Stashik, a Realtor in Lake Forest, said the current mortgage deduction is what has allowed many of her clients to make the purchases they did. “When we first bought our home, it was the difference in us being able to afford our house. For many of my first time home buyers, it is the difference,” Ms. Stashik said. One of her clients, Amanda Penny, is looking for a new home for a better commute to her work at a mortgage company. Ms. Penny, 32 years old with a nearly-year old baby, said she hopes this next home would be the one she and her husband retire in. A voting Republican, she said she and her husband are watching what a tax overhaul might mean for them, but “it hasn’t impacted our decisions because, ultimately, we have to make the move.” If their taxes rise overall, she said they would look to make adjustments, including other deductions, to lessen the impact. Still, she said, the proposed lower mortgage-deduction cap “was kind of a slap in the face for us.” Michael McClellan, a Republican activist in Orange County who opposes the bill, said people may not be scrutinizing the tax plan or following the ins and outs of negotiations because, “I think by and large people trust the Republican Party on taxes.” “Which is why if this goes the wrong way, and people actually get a tax increase, the sense of betrayal will be so profound,” Mr. McClellan said. Mr. McClellan’s congressman, Dana Rohrabacher, voted against the bill. His district neighbors Mrs. Walters’s.

"Within hours of a fire at Kelly Laub’s four-bedroom house in New Smyrna Beach, Fla., in June, four contracting companies showed up to offer rebuilding services.

Each vendor wanted Ms. Laub to sign a document giving the contractor the rights to her homeowners insurance benefits, she said. In exchange, they offered to repair her home and negotiate with her insurance company on her behalf.

These assignment of benefit, or AOB, contracts are upending the insurance market in one of the largest U.S. states. Insurers and regulators said the pacts are responsible for driving up insurance rates for some Florida homeowners and spurring a boom in contractor lawsuits against insurers.

Based on current AOB trends, the average statewide annual homeowners insurance premium for a $150,000 new home is projected to rise from $1,232.08 in 2017 to $1,595.07 in 2022, a 29% increase, according to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. These increases are higher than nationwide projections from the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group.

Rate increases could steepen, executives said, if damage from Hurricane Irma last month causes major losses for the state’s insurers or an increase in AOB-related lawsuits. Many Irma-related insurance claims are still being processed so it’s too soon to see much litigation related to the storm. Catastrophe-modeling firms expect the insured losses to reach the tens of billions.

“The concern is that when you have a large event such as Irma, that when you add AOB on top of it, it’s just going to magnify the impact of the storm,” said Don Matz, president of Tower Hill Insurance in Gainesville, Fla. Tower Hill has raised rates for homeowners in some Southeast Florida counties by up to 15% in the past year partly due to AOB costs, he said.

AOBs allow repair companies to report a homeowner’s claim to an insurer and be paid directly, without the money going first to the consumer. Contractors can sue the insurer if there is a disagreement about the cost of the claim. They also can go after homeowners to make up for shortfalls if the insurer doesn’t pay the full amount requested, according to regulators.

Other states allow AOB agreements, but they have had a larger impact in Florida because of a state law that requires the insurer to pay attorneys’ fees if more money is awarded after a lawsuit than was initially offered. Insurers say the use of AOB agreements in Florida encourages contractors to overcharge insurers for repair work and perform more work than is needed.

Heritage Insurance in Clearwater, Fla., will pay out about $50 million more than it otherwise would have this year due to AOB claims, said Chief Executive Bruce Lucas.

In Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, where AOB lawsuits are most prevalent, Heritage’s average cost for a water claim has risen from $8,000 three years ago to $25,000, Mr. Lucas said.

Some lawyers, consumer advocates and contractors say AOB agreements can help homeowners who are unfamiliar with the claims process and don’t know how to navigate the system. Many homeowners are frustrated when some insurers can take days or even weeks to send adjusters to inspect damage, said Sha’Ron James, Florida’s insurance consumer advocate.

“The lawyers have found an opening,” Ms. James said. “They realized there are a lot of unhappy consumers.”

Some contractors say the agreements also ensure builders are paid fairly for their work. “Unless I have an assignment of benefit, I may not get paid, or I won’t get paid the right amount,” said David DeBlander, president of Pro Clean Restoration and Cleaning in Pensacola, Fla.

More than 28,000 AOB lawsuits were filed in Florida in 2016, up from 405 in 2006, according to the state’s Department of Financial Services. Through July of this year, more than 20,000 AOB lawsuits were filed.

Insurers and regulators warn that AOB costs could accelerate rate increases in the state. When HCI Group Inc.’s Homeowners Choice unit requested a 3.3% rate increase from Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation this year, regulators told the company the increase wasn’t sufficient to cover its rising AOB costs. An actuarial analysis indicated a hike of 19% was justified. The insurer ended up increasing its rates by 8%.

Earlier this year, state insurance regulators unsuccessfully sought legislation to curb AOB lawsuits by limiting the instances in which insurers are required to pay attorneys’ fees. Lawmakers are taking up the issues again, and the new effort is in the early stages.

Some law firms say insurers are trying to take homeowners’ rights away in pursuing legislation to reduce AOB lawsuits. One firm, Cohen Law Group in Maitland, Fla., holds AOB workshops for vendors ​to “show you the insider secrets that the insurance companies don’t want you to know,” its website says.

Not all homeowners are embracing the agreements. Brooke Fehr, a magazine editor in Sanford, Fla., tried to get repair estimates from about five roofing companies after Irma. All but one wouldn’t look at her roof unless she signed an AOB contract, she said.

After seeing warnings from state regulators and her insurance company, she decided not to sign. “It’s really tough to be put into this position,” Ms. Fehr said. “You’re basically told nobody will do business with you if you don’t [assign benefits], but the state is saying absolutely don’t do business this way.”

The state warns consumers not to sign anything before talking to their insurance companies. It has been issuing these warnings since at least 2016.

Ms. Laub, the homeowner in New Smyrna Beach, refused to sign any assignment of benefits contracts following her house fire.

She had signed one earlier in the year for roof damage and regretted it, because the roofing company turned out to be unreliable.

“Once they have that assignment of benefits, the policyholder is kind of out of the loop,” she said.

"It is still true: What begins as tragedy can end as farce. So it is with the case of Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of assaulting her when she was 15 and he was 17.

As of the most recent available moment in this episode, Ms. Ford’s lawyer said her client would not appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee until there is a “full investigation by law-enforcement officials.” Like the Mueller excavations, that could run to the horizon, unable to find anything but unwilling to stop until it finds something.

Let us posit that the one thing not at issue here is the truth. As a matter of law and fact, Ms. Ford’s accusation can be neither proved nor disproved. This is as obvious now as it must have been when Dianne Feinstein and the other Democrats came into possession of this incident.

Surely someone pointed out that based on what was disclosed, this accusation could not be substantiated. To which the Democrats responded: So what? Its political value is that it cannot be disproved. They saw that six weeks before a crucial midterm election, the unresolvable case of Christine Blasey Ford would sit like a stalled hurricane over the entire Republican Party, drowning its candidates in a force they could not stop.

In #MeToo, which began in the predations of Harvey Weinstein, Democrats and progressives finally have found a weapon against which there seems to be no defense. It can be used to exterminate political enemies. If one unprovable accusation doesn’t suffice, why not produce a second, or third? It’s a limitless standard.

The Democrats’ broader strategy is: Delay the vote past the election; win the Senate by convincing suburban women that Republicans are implacably hostile to them; seize power; and—the point of it all—take down the Trump government.

This is the “resistance.” This is what Democrats have become. Resistance is a word and strategy normally found in a revolutionary context, which is precisely the argument made by the left to justify its actions against this presidency since the evening of Nov. 8, 2016. Anything goes. Whatever it takes. Brett Kavanaugh is not much more than a casualty of war.

Rather than try to argue or win public issues on substance, the Democrats have become a party that seems to think it can win with muscle alone. Environmentalism emerged in the 1970s as a worthwhile idea that attracted the interest and support of both parties. From Al Gore onward, it became a bludgeon to beat up the other party. Now sexual abuse, an issue originating in utmost seriousness, has been quickly captured and fashioned into a political weapon by the Democratic left.

Politics as trench warfare has relieved the Democrats of the burden of thought. Extending the Pelosi Rule—we have to pass the bill to find out what’s in it—we now have the Gillibrand Standard.

Commenting this week on Ford v. Kavanaugh, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, another 2020 presidential aspirant, said, “I believe it is disqualifying, given what we know.” In other words, what she believes is based on next to nothing.

Put on defense by these accusations, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley unsurprisingly agreed to a hearing in which Ms. Ford would tell her story and Judge Kavanaugh would speak. Then the senators would vote.

Consider the spectacle: Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination for the U.S. Supreme Court, the embodiment of a modern rule of law, is being decided in the Senate by the medieval practice of trial by ordeal, such as surviving immersion in fire or ice. Trial by ordeal was outlawed by the Lateran Council in 1215.

Or worse, the standards of the mob in the Roman Colosseum, turning thumbs up or down on the combatants. Though unlike the Senate Democrats, the Roman mob at least had an open mind.

Incidentally, the standard trope that Donald Trump has degraded our politics? We don’t need to hear that anymore. Or about the moral certitudes of the religious right.

Is there a sadder figure in the modern Democratic Party than Sen. Dianne Feinstein? Elected to the Senate in 1992, Mrs. Feinstein has produced a creditable career. Her above-it-all reputation was never quite deserved, but she has at least performed with dignity.

Now, seeking re-election at 85, she is getting heat from the progressive-dominated Democratic Party in California, the world capital of identity-only politics. By withholding from the committee the accusatory Ford letter that came into her possession nearly two months ago, Sen. Feinstein ensured the nomination’s descent into such a hapless, cynical moment. This will be the most remembered event in Sen. Feinstein’s career.

The Kavanaugh nomination, “given what we know,” has come down to an undiscoverable accusation. The defeat of a Supreme Court nominee on this basis would be a victory for a level of conscious political nullification not seen in the U.S. for a long time. Republicans in the Senate shouldn’t allow it, and voters in November should not affirm it.

"Daphne Sheldrick rarely met an animal she didn’t want to nuzzle. Her menagerie over the years included a warthog named Grunter and a civet fond of being sprinkled with Old Spice shaving lotion. Her deepest love, however, was for elephants.

She created and ran the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, named after her late husband, who developed and managed parklands and animal refuges in Kenya. The trust, founded in 1977, operates a nursery at Nairobi National Park, where orphaned baby elephants are raised and prepared to return to the wild. It also educates young people about wildlife and fights poaching by bandits seeking elephant tusks and rhino horns for export to Asia.

Baby elephants often are orphaned when their mothers are killed by poachers, fall into wells or succumb to drought. By trial and error, Ms. Sheldrick found that a baby formula containing coconut oil was the best way to nurture her wrinkly orphans. “You have to mix gallons, not pints,” she wrote in a memoir.

She described herself as a “surrogate mother” and trained African keepers to help her raise the orphans, feeding them once every three hours and staying near them around the clock.

Ms. Sheldrick died of breast cancer April 12 in Nairobi. She was 83.

She blamed human greed and ignorance for depleting the elephant population in Africa and was disdainful of the widespread belief in Asia that rhino horns are a cure for ailments including rheumatism and impotence. Rhino horns are composed of keratin, also found in fingernails, “so consumers could get the same thing simply through biting their nails,” she wrote in her 2012 memoir “Love, Life and Elephants.”

The trust she created urges donors to “foster” elephants for $50 a year and up.

Daphne Marjorie Jenkins was born June 4, 1934, and grew up on a farm near Gilgil, about 80 miles northwest of Nairobi. Her family had emigrated from Britain to Kenya via South Africa during British colonial days. She recalled a childhood of bonding with animals, wild and domesticated, and the occasional thrill of ice cream made from hailstones. Her life was less idyllic at a boarding school in Nakuru, Kenya, where, she wrote, a headmaster fondled girls’ breasts and forced those with low test scores to declaim, “I am stupid.”

Though a bright student, she ended her schooling at 16 and three years later married Bill Woodley, an assistant park warden. Mr. Woodley worked for David Sheldrick, who also grew up in a British colonial family and headed an effort to turn vast tracts of scrubland in Kenya’s Tsavo region into a national park that would attract overseas tourists and preserve wildlife.

Her passion for Mr. Woodley swiftly cooled. “My marriage, and sex in particular, fell far short of my girlhood expectations,” she wrote. Meanwhile, her attraction to Mr. Sheldrick—a dashing World War II veteran and self-taught authority on African wildlife—grew as she worked for him as an office assistant and accompanied him on trips into the wilds. She eventually obtained an amicable divorce from Mr. Woodley and married Mr. Sheldrick in 1960.

Her love of elephants survived a near-fatal encounter in 1994. Believing she recognized an elephant she knew as Eleanor, Ms. Sheldrick approached the animal among a herd at a watering hole and, in a friendly greeting, reached up to stroke it behind an ear.

Too late she realized the elephant wasn’t Eleanor. The surprised animal used its trunk to hurl her into a pile of boulders, shattering numerous bones. She needed surgeries and more than a year of therapy before she could walk normally again.

Her younger daughter, Angela Sheldrick, now runs the wildlife trust. Daphne Sheldrick—also known as Dame Daphne after being named a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire—is also survived by another daughter, Gillian Woodley, two sisters and four grandchildren.

She knew her elephants from tail to trunk, including their digestive tracts. She particularly appreciated the ears. “The hind side of an elephant’s ear is as soft and smooth to the touch as silk and always deliciously cool,” she wrote.

She also felt an emotional kinship. “Elephants are just like us, only better,” she told the Sunday Times of London in 2012. “They have emotions, relationships and an extraordinary memory. Once an elephant loves you, that love stands for life.”

"North Korea’s moratorium on missile test flights has precluded it from trying out the technology it would need to strike the U.S. with a nuclear-tipped ICBM, a top U.S. military officer said Friday.

While North Korea has demonstrated that it has nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, it hasn’t shown that it has mastered the complicated steps of delivering a warhead to the U.S. mainland, said Air Force Gen. Paul Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

To do that, Pyongyang needs to develop and test a reliable targeting system and a survivable re-entry vehicle, the portion of a missile that contains a nuclear warhead and which is designed to withstand the stress of re-entering the atmosphere.

“Our assessment is he has not closed those last two pieces of the kill chain,” Gen. Selva told the Air Force Association, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

U.S. and North Korean talks on eliminating North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs have been stymied, and Pyongyang has continued to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons.

But Gen. Selva’s comments underscore that some of the gestures North Korea has made—specifically, suspending nuclear and missile tests—have security benefits for the U.S.

“We have not seen a demonstration of a reliable R.V.,” said Gen. Selva, referring to the re-entry vehicle. “And we have not seen a demonstration of a reliable arming, targeting and fusing system that would allow the system to survive and actually detonate when he wants it to detonate.”

North Korea last year test fired intercontinental ballistic missiles that have the range to reach the U.S. But in carrying out those launches, it fired the missiles on “lofted” trajectories, in which they reached a high altitude but didn’t cover a great distance horizontally.

As a consequence, those test flights didn’t replicate the flight path a missile would take if it was fired at the U.S. On such a trajectory, a re-entry vehicle would go faster and would be subject to higher temperatures, experts say.

North Korea also hasn’t conducted a missile test flight since November.

“It has had an impact,” Gen. Selva said of the moratorium. “But we don’t know what impact it’s had on his logic,” he added, referring to Mr. Kim.

Even though North Korea hasn’t fully developed its ICBM capabilities, Gen. Selva said, it may think the system is good enough and try to use it in a crisis. So the Pentagon’s missile defense system needs to be prepared to intercept it, he said.

“We have to assume he might shoot one,” Gen. Selva said. “We would have to be prepared to defend. But we might actually make the choice not to shoot because we assert based on what we know about the system and its trajectory that it’s not going to hit anything.”

Joseph Bermudez, a military analyst for 38 North, a website on North Korean affairs, said that Pyongyang has already reaped political gains from its ICBM program despite its limitations.

“North Korea’s ballistic missile program has already enabled it to achieve its strategic goal of being perceived as an existential threat to the U.S.,” he said. “North Korea is at the center of the international stage.”

"DES MOINES, Iowa—There is no candidate in the country for whom Sen. Bernie Sanders has expended more political capital this year than Pete D’Alessandro.

Mr. Sanders hosted a rally for Mr. D’Alessandro, a U.S. House candidate who ran the Vermont senator’s 2016 presidential campaign in Iowa. He twice emailed his supporters soliciting campaign funds for Mr. D’Alessandro and recorded his only TV ad of the year to urge support for him.

Yet Mr. D’Alessandro, a longtime Iowa Democratic political operative, appears from public polling set to place third in Tuesday’s Democratic primary. The Sanders seal of approval, for Mr. D’Alessandro and a handful of other Democrats, isn’t turning out to be a winning one in this year’s congressional elections.

“Bernie is Bernie, it’s a one-person movement,” said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic Party chairman for Polk County, which includes Des Moines.

If the Sanders machine can’t produce votes for a candidate who shares his policy platform, has a full-throated endorsement and remains connected to top volunteers, it raises the question of whether Mr. Sanders can turn out his voters for any candidate here and beyond.

The Sanders endorsement hasn’t spurred other Democrats to victory in contested House primaries.

Last month in Pennsylvania, Mr. Sanders backed Rich Lazer and Greg Edwards, who each finished third in Democratic congressional primaries in the Philadelphia suburbs. Marie Newman lost a hard-fought March primary for a congressional seat in Illinois 12 days after Mr. Sanders endorsed her.

Of House candidates with primary opponents Mr. Sanders has endorsed this year, only Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, in Illinois, has won. Mr. Garcia, widely considered their heir apparent to retiring Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez, prevailed by 45 percentage points in March.

Other candidates running on the Sanders platform—such as Kara Eastman in Nebraska—have won primaries against establishment-minded opponents without the benefit of the Vermont senator’s explicit support.

“Even candidates who don’t win can make a tremendous impact on the country and we saw that in the 2016 race,” said Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders’s chief political aide. “What is important is the number of candidates running on the issues that Bernie talked about in 2016. The issues that people are running on are getting advanced and we’re moving the agenda forward.”

An aide said Mr. Sanders didn’t have time to be interviewed. This weekend he hosted at a rally in Anaheim, Calif., to protest Walt Disney Co. ’s treatment of its theme park employees. Mr. Sanders hasn’t endorsed any of the Democrats running in Orange County’s contested primaries.

Mr. D’Alessandro’s distant third place showing in the Des Moines Register’s poll is the latest evidence that despite the political mainstreaming of Mr. Sanders’s once-considered-fringe policy ideas—such as implementing a single-payer health care system and a $15-per-hour minimum wage—his personal endorsements can’t carry candidates to victory in tough primaries.

Mr. D’Alessandro spent the past year trying to stitch back together the Sanders coalition he built during the state’s 2016 presidential caucuses to fight Hillary Clinton to a surprising draw.

Newsletter Sign-up

During an interview in his campaign office last week, he said polling doesn’t account for Sanders backers who are infrequent participants in Democratic primaries.

Mr. D’Alessandro said he is a viable candidate only because of help from Mr. Sanders. The email solicitations from Mr. Sanders raised between $135,000 and $150,000—about half of the $283,000 he has raised, according to the latest campaign finance reports.

“I’m only able to make this race because Bernie Sanders changed the rules for someone like me, who can’t self-fund and doesn’t appeal to the $2,700 donors,” Mr. D’Alessandro said.

Leading the race, according to the Register’s poll, are Cindy Axne, a small-business owner backed by the pro-abortion rights group Emily’s List who has raised $548,000, and Eddie Mauro, an insurance company executive who has self-funded $350,000 of the $598,000 he has raised.

The Democratic primary winner will face GOP Rep. David Young, a two-term incumbent. His campaign said he is focused on his race, not the opposition’s primary.

President Donald Trump carried the district by 4 percentage points, but former President Barack Obama won it twice. The Cook Political Report lists it as “lean Republican” this November.

Ms. Axne said the district’s Democrats aren’t interested in branding themselves in the Sanders or Clinton camps.

“We’re all trying to get to the same outcomes,” Ms. Axne, who backed Mrs. Clinton in 2016, said at a West Des Moines coffee shop. “It’s just a little bit of variance in how we get there.”

Mr. Mauro, who backed former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley in the 2016 presidential race, called himself a “bold progressive” during a televised debate Thursday. Nobody in the congressional race, he said, has a claim on the Sanders coalition.

“Pete’s not Bernie Sanders,” Mr. Mauro said in an interview after the debate.

Even Mr. Sanders’s own family members have been unable to turn their connection to him into electoral success.

Mr. Sanders’s stepdaughter, Carina Driscoll, lost a March contest for mayor of Burlington, Vt., and his son, Levi, has raised just $11,000 in his run for Congress from an open seat in New Hampshire. Mr. Sanders hasn’t endorsed either of them.

“Levi will be running his own campaign, in his own way, with his own ideas,” he said in a statement to New Hampshire newspapers when his son launched his campaign.

"Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton and his fellow Princeton University professor and wife, Anne Case, made headlines two years ago when they reported that mortality rates among white, working-class Americans are going up in contrast to other demographic groups in the U.S.

Since then, the two have continued to dig into what is behind the increase in “deaths of despair” among white, middle-aged Americans with low levels of education.

They sat down with Wall Street Journal News Editor Janet Adamy to discuss their latest findings. Edited excerpts follow.

Two Americas

MS. ADAMY: You were here two years ago. Since then, Donald Trump has been elected president. The opioid crisis has worsened. What has your research found since then?

DR. DEATON: We’ve dug a lot deeper into the details. We’ve discovered that it was no flash in the pan. The numbers were correct. Bad things are really happening, and they’re continuing to happen.

We dug down a lot more into the educational differences and found that it is very much a two-Americas situation, where people with bachelor’s degrees are doing pretty well and those without them aren’t doing very well at all.

MS. ADAMY: And you discovered that the mortality rates among this population of white Americans have worsened in a way that has no historical precedent?

DR. DEATON: That’s right. You can find episodes like the flu epidemic or wartimes when mortality rates go up, but sustained increases in mortality for any major group in any society are really quite rare. It’s an indication that something is very wrong.

ANGUS DEATON | ‘Something is very wrong.’ Photo: Paul Morse for The Wall Street Journal

MS. ADAMY: Anne, why exactly is this happening?

DR. CASE: I think there are several answers to that. Mortality rates for suicide, for drug overdose, for alcoholism are rising for people without a college degree. Those are the big increases that we’re seeing, and it isn’t just about the financial crisis. This started back as far as we can break out education in death certificates, which is 1990. It has been a slow, steady trend up in all three of those for people without a B.A.

In addition to that, we’ve stopped making progress on heart disease in the U.S., which is stunning. Every other country continues to watch mortality fall. Antihypertensives and people stopping smoking had huge effects on deaths from heart disease. But our mortality rates from heart disease have flatlined and that’s a really big killer. So we have to better understand why that has happened in the U.S.

MS. ADAMY: There is a stark difference in terms of what is happening in the U.S. versus our peer countries. Why is white mortality going up in the U.S., but not in other countries?

DR. DEATON: One of the immediate things is opioids. European countries have much tighter controls on the way opioids are distributed. There has been none of this mass prescribing of opioids that has happened in the U.S. We have to get that genie back in the bottle. That’s very important, but it isn’t all of it. Of the three [types of] deaths we’ve looked at, suicides, opioids, and alcoholic liver disease, the biggest single one is opioids. But the other two together are bigger than opioids.

DR. CASE: I think opioids made it a perfect storm. But it was the case that people were killing themselves slowly with alcohol or quickly with guns even before the opioid crisis started. OxyContin wasn’t even on the market until 1996. We also want people to understand that this [is affecting] women, as well as men.

MS. ADAMY: What do you see in terms of geography? Where is this happening?

DR. CASE: In every state, deaths from suicide have increased between 1999 and 2015. In every state but two, alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis increases. In every state, drug overdoses.

MS. ADAMY: Interestingly, among blacks and Hispanics, mortality rates have fallen regardless of education level. Why is that?

DR. CASE: That was one of the first surprises to hit us. When we think about bad things, we usually think that the first population to be hit are African-Americans. But the death rates from alcohol and drugs fell through the ‘90s and the early 2000s until about 2010 for African-Americans, while they rose for whites.

So then, if you’re digging into what the underlying causes are, we are beginning to speculate about working-class whites possibly having the pillars that held up their lives beginning to crumble.

Lost generation

MS. ADAMY: And what were those pillars?

DR. CASE: Having a job with a ladder up, with on-the-job training, with benefits. Having a job where you could actually ask a woman to marry you and she would marry you. Now, marriage rates among working-class people are way down. She doesn’t want to marry him if he doesn’t have a good job.

Cohabitation is way up. But unlike in Europe, where those cohabitations are quite stable, in the U.S., they are fragile. Neither of them has a good job. They aren’t married, so they don’t have that stability. And they’ve moved away from what we call legacy churches, the Catholic and Protestant churches, toward evangelical churches, which focus on the individual. It’s my personal relationship with my savior, rather than it being about us as a community.

So those pillars of life—church, family, job—have disappeared for the white working class in a way that it hasn’t really been the case for blacks.

MS. ADAMY: You found that those in middle age now are likely to be worse off in old age than the current population. Can anything be done about that?

DR. DEATON: Several people have used the term lost generation for those people. It’s very unclear what to do with them. Their economic status will improve a little bit as they move into old age, simply because initial Social Security payments are indexed on average wages.

But we don’t think financial security is the essence of this matter. We think their lives will come apart in the way that Anne has been talking about. You’re a 55-year-old guy. You have never been married, but you’ve been in three consecutive relationships. You have three sets of kids, none of whom you know anymore because the younger ones are living with other guys. The community that you used to have has disintegrated.

Many people have mixed views about unions, but unions used to give people some measure of control at work. They gave them a social life and political representation in Washington, which doesn’t really exist anymore.

MS. ADAMY: Can employers do anything to help improve the fortunes of this working-class population?

DR. CASE: We don’t think the answer is getting everyone to go to college. That doesn’t seem realistic. The problem, we think, is that these people don’t have any standing in the labor market anymore.

The minimum wage hasn’t increased since, what, 1997? Noncompete clauses in labor contracts, even for working-class people, mean they can’t take a job for higher wages elsewhere. I think the lack of enforcement of antitrust laws means that some very large employers have [too much] power over the workforce. And so I think that one of the things that could happen is trying to rebuild the social contract between labor and capital. We are all at risk if we don’t do that.

"A Turkish court sentenced Wall Street Journal reporter Ayla Albayrak to two years and one month in prison Tuesday, declaring her guilty of engaging in terrorist propaganda in support of a banned Kurdish separatist organization through one of her Journal articles.

The conviction of Ms. Albayrak, who is currently in New York, highlights the increasing targeting of journalists in Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government has gained attention for deteriorating media freedoms.

“This was an unfounded criminal charge and wildly inappropriate conviction that wrongly singled out a balanced Wall Street Journal report,” said Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Gerard Baker. “The sole purpose of the article was to provide objective and independent reporting on events in Turkey, and it succeeded.”

Ms. Albayrak plans to appeal the decision. “Given the current climate in Turkey, this appalling decision shouldn’t have come as a surprise to me, but it did,” she said.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said it condemned the Turkish court decision.

“The conviction of Ayla in Turkey is a very worrying sign and an escalation of the crackdown on the press,” said Nina Ognianova, the CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, calling Turkey the world’s top jailer of journalists. “We call on the Turkish authorities to overturn this decision immediately,” she said.

Turkish legal actions against Ms. Albayrak began after the publication on Aug. 19, 2015, on the Journal’s website of her article “Urban Warfare Escalates in Turkey’s Kurdish-Majority Southeast.” The article and accompanying video reported on the state of a conflict in Silopi, Turkey, between Turkish security forces and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. It included interviews with the local mayor and residents, a Turkish government official, as well as a representative of an organization Turkey says is the youth unit of the PKK.

Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union consider the PKK a terrorist organization.

In November of the same year, Ms. Albayrak, who has dual Finnish and Turkish citizenship, received a written order on her door to visit her local police station in Istanbul where she was notified she was under investigation for spreading terrorist propaganda.

At the police station, she gave a statement saying the article accurately reflected the state of the conflict between the PKK and the Turkish government. In April 2016, a prosecutor in southeastern Turkey filed an indictment against Ms. Albayrak alleging that she violated antiterror laws.

Ms. Albayrak testified from the Istanbul court house to the Cizre court via video-link in January 2017.

William Lewis, Dow Jones’s chief executive officer and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, said: “This ruling against a professional and respected journalist is an affront to all who are committed to furthering a free and robust press. We call on those who share this commitment to make their voices heard.

“The notion that our reporter’s commendable and insightful work led to a criminal prosecution that has resulted in this wrongful conviction is intolerable,” Mr. Lewis said. “We have stood by Ms. Albayrak’s side for nearly two years as we have robustly pursued all available options to defend this baseless prosecution, and we will continue to stand with her as we seek to overturn this conviction.”

As part of the article she was convicted for, Ms. Albayrak interviewed a person who described herself as a member of the Patriotic Revolutionary Youth Movement, or YDG-H, which the Turkish government says is the youth unit of the PKK.

Ms. Albayrak said in a statement included in the court documents that the original article didn’t include any praise for the group, but rather provided a balanced and objective view of urban warfare that had gripped areas of Turkey’s predominantly Kurdish southeast at the time.

“The decision shows the extent to which the authorities did not want the operations that were going on in Turkey’s southeast to be reported on,” said Ms. Albayrak. “It also shows yet again, that the international media is not immune to the ongoing press crackdown in Turkey.”

The court decision comes amid an escalating diplomatic spat between Washington and Ankara that has seen the U.S. suspend nearly all types of visa services for Turks. The row erupted after a U.S. consulate employee was arrested on suspicion of having ties to U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for last year’s failed coup. Turkey in response said it was suspending U.S. visa applications. Mr. Gulen denies the accusation.

Court documents filed against Ms. Albayrak say the Journal article and accompanying video, which included images of men and women bearing PKK emblems, provided fodder for 24 Turkish-language websites that translated parts of the article. Turkish officials sent a list of the websites’ articles in late August to the country’s Telecommunication Directorate to have them blocked.

Ms. Albayrak and the Journal have said they have no relationship with any of the Turkish-language websites that published only parts of her article. The Journal said excerpts published by the websites were distorted.

Ms. Albayrak said she was charged around the same time that the Turkish government had begun a crackdown on Kurdish-majority cities in the country’s southeast, where many members of the ethnic minority live.

Mr. Baker said Ms. Albayrak embodies The Wall Street Journal tradition, “spending years as an intrepid journalist producing insightful, fair and impartial coverage from Turkey. We will work tirelessly to overturn this preposterous conviction.”

The case is a rare instance of terrorism charges brought against a reporter working for a Western media outlet. Deniz Yücel, a prominent German-Turkish journalist for newspaper Die Welt, was arrested in Istanbul in February under terrorism suspicions and remains in pretrial detention without official charges despite repeated protests from the German government. Mr. Yücel has denied any wrongdoing.

In the wake of last year’s failed coup against Mr. Erdogan’s government, authorities have increased focus on journalists they suspect harbor sympathies for Mr. Gulen, as well as those who report on Kurdish separatism.

Mesale Tolu, a Turkish-German citizen who worked as a translator for the leftist-leaning Etkin Haber Ajansi, was detained earlier this year on suspicion of spreading terrorist propaganda and belonging to a leftist organization considered a terrorist group in Turkey, CPJ said. She is scheduled to go on trial on Wednesday.

Amnesty International and other rights groups say Turkey has more journalists jailed than any other country in the world. Authorities have closed more than 150 media outlets under the state of emergency’s executive orders, according to Human Rights Watch and Freedom House.

Turkey ranked 155 on Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index this year, worse than Russia or Pakistan. The index is based on statistics of violence against journalists, along with evaluations of pluralism, media independence, self-censorship and legislation.

“Media freedom and pluralism has largely been crushed,” said Johann Bihr, who analyzes Turkey for Reporters Without Borders.

Under the state of emergency in place since the coup, authorities have applied antiterrorism laws in some cases to restrict access to legal counsel and increase the duration of pretrial detention.

The government “aggressively used the penal code, criminal defamation legislation and the country’s anti-terrorism law to punish critical reporting, and journalists faced growing violence,” said democracy advocacy group Freedom House last year.

The PKK picked up arms in 1984 to fight for an independent Kurdish homeland within Turkey’s borders.

Since the PKK’s first insurrection, the group has been responsible for numerous bombings of civilian and military targets in Ankara, Istanbul and numerous cities throughout the southeast.

"On Friday, Father Raúl Enríquez celebrated Mass at the Church of Divine Mercy in Managua for the first time since police and allied paramilitary forces attacked the church to drive out protesters who had sought sanctuary there.

MONIMBÓ, Nicaragua—The Rev. César Augusto Gutiérrez delivered an impassioned plea to a Spanish radio station last week as hundreds of elite police and paramilitary forces stormed his parish here in a hail of bullets.

“They are defiling the churches,” Father Gutierrez said before breaking down in tears as he pleaded for international support. “The government is killing us.”

He described in a halting voice how neighborhood youths in Monimbó, the heart of what has become a national movement of resistance to President Daniel Ortega, confronted the onslaught with stones and homemade rockets from behind street barricades.

“They can’t keep governing over a pile of the dead,” he said.

Scenes on Friday at the Church of Divine Mercy in Managua on Friday. Nicaragua’s bishops have scheduled a month of prayer and atonement, with special Friday masses to exorcise the evils that plague the country. The image of Christ, below, is now marked by three bullet holes from a raid by paramilitary forces on July 13.

For more than three months, Mr. Ortega has set loose his forces on Nicaraguans who have rebelled against his government, after what started as local protests against a tax increase turned into a national movement. More than 300 people have been killed, most of them opponents of Mr. Ortega, human-rights groups say.

The Catholic Church, the oldest and most prestigious institution in Nicaragua, has been on the front lines. Clergy have been assaulted and at least 10 churches have been attacked, shot at, looted or defiled during the last three months, mostly by government-allied paramilitary groups, clerics said.

After protests broke out in April, the church—at Mr. Ortega’s request—agreed to mediate a national dialogue to try to resolve Nicaragua’s crisis.

On Thursday, the president shifted course, railing against the church before tens of thousands of supporters in a speech marking the 39th anniversary of the triumph of his Sandinista revolution over dictator Anastasio Somoza.

Jabbing his hands into the air, Mr. Ortega said the bishops were allied with opponents seeking a violent coup.

“Many churches were used as barracks to store ammunition and bombs and to use as bases to attack and assassinate,” he said, as the crowd chanted support. “The opposition is in league with Satan, and the bishops should exorcise them.”

Paramilitary groups in Monimbó, Nicaragua, after government security forces and their allies moved in against protesters last week.

Clerics saw the speech as a signal from Mr. Ortega that he was broadening his crackdown. All of Nicaragua’s bishops have been threatened since the speech, said Bishop Rolando Álvarez of Matagalpa, in the north of the country.

“We have many priests who have taken refuge,” he said. “I dare say that all priests, or practically all, fear for their lives.”

The day after the speech, the government abandoned a church-brokered deal to help rescue some 200 youths who had escaped Mr. Ortega’s police and paramilitary forces. The students had fled into the countryside after the government retook Monimbó.

“He doesn’t like our position of defending victims and denouncing violent acts and assassinations,” said Bishop Carlos Herrera of Jinotega, in northern Nicaragua.

Mr. Ortega and the Sandinista movement have been at odds with the Catholic Church for much of their long, intertwined history. Although a few priests influenced by leftist “liberation theology” played key roles during his first years in office, Mr. Ortega clashed with the Nicaraguan hierarchy and with Pope John Paul II. The late pope, in a famous incident, wagged his finger at a priest in the Sandinista government on the tarmac of the Managua airport during his 1983 visit.

Monimbó was the heart of an uprising against Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega; paramilitary forces patrolled the town last week.

In 2014, the Nicaraguan Bishop’s Conference called for democratization as Mr. Ortega, who has been president since 2007 and previously held the office from 1985-90, took control of congress, courts and electoral authorities. The president has since abolished term limits and used state institutions to destroy any serious political opposition.

The recent protests, which took the nation by surprise, began in April after Mr. Ortega raised taxes to rescue an insolvent social security system. College students leading demonstrations against the increase in the capital, Managua, were confronted by Mr. Ortega’s police forces and their allies.

Dozens of protesters were killed in a military response that unleashed a national backlash in places including Monimbó, part of the city of Masaya. For a time, protesters took over entire cities and blocked the nation’s main roads.

In recent days, Mr. Ortega has retaken much of the territory that he lost in the first weeks of protests. His loyalists knocked down most barricades with overwhelming firepower. He has passed a law that will allow terrorism charges against protesters and those who financially support protests.

The government violence has been widely condemned, and the U.S. has sanctioned top Nicaraguan officials close to the president. But Mr. Ortega has been defiant, asserting the government would strengthen its “self-defense mechanisms.”

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, center in cap, waves to supporters celebrating the 39th anniversary of the victory of his Sandinista revolution. Mr. Ortega used the speech to denounce opposition forces calling for his ouster.

Attacks against the Church increased in ferocity this month. On July 13, paramilitaries wearing ski masks shot up the parish house and Church of Divine Mercy in Managua. There were more than 100 protesters inside, many of them students from a nearby university who had sought refuge. Two people were killed and 10 wounded during the 15-hour siege.

“We were all on the floor, the lights were out, we were all terrified,” said the Rev. Erick Alvarado, who lived through the attack. In the sacristy, three bullets perforated a life-size painting of Christ.

Two days later, Bishop Abelardo Mata of the northern diocese of Estelí was attacked by a mob of government supporters as police looked on at a road checkpoint. The mob shot six homemade explosives at his car, breaking the windshield and puncturing its tires. Msgr. Mata managed to take refuge in a house, and was later taken to safety under police escort after an intervention by diplomats.

ABOVE: Azucena López (center) weeps over the death of her son Erick Jiménez, who was killed when pro-Ortega groups attacked protesters in Monimbó. BELOW: Family and friends during the funeral procession on Wednesday.

“They were shooting to kill,” said a witness.

The bishop continues to get death threats, which escalated after Mr. Ortega’s speech on Thursday, the witness added: “They say they are going to give him lead, lead, and more lead.”

The previous week, mobs attacked the country’s cardinal, other leading prelates and the Vatican’s diplomatic envoy when the clergymen tried to rescue people who had taken refuge in a church in the town of Diriamba.

In that melee, Bishop Silvio Báez, auxiliary bishop of Managua, was punched in the stomach as an assailant tried to steal his pectoral cross. He suffered a deep gash on his arm as he defended himself.

“It was a very difficult moment,” he said. “They shouted ‘assassins, criminals!”

Mr. Ortega began his career as a communist guerrilla chief. He served as president from 1985 to 1990 as his Sandinista government battled U.S.-backed guerrillas known as “Contras” in a civil war that cost thousands of lives. During his years out of office, he used his control of Sandinista unions to mobilize violent protests.

During his second incarnation as president, Mr. Ortega discarded his previous policies of nationalizing private businesses. Instead, he made a pact with Nicaragua’s private sector which helped to deliver solid economic growth. Under his rule, Nicaragua also avoided the scourge of gang violence which has given its Central American neighbors some of the highest homicide rates in the world.

Although the Catholic Church in Nicaragua, as in all Latin America, has lost faithful to evangelical churches, it has remained a respected institution in Nicaragua because it has been close to the country’s poor and, under Mr. Ortega, outspoken in the defense of justice.

Mr. Ortega’s political career got a boost before the presidential race of 2006 when he made amends with Nicaragua’s then cardinal, the late Miguel Obando y Bravo, who had been a ferocious critic of Mr. Ortega and the Sandinistas during much of the 1980s. Now, with Thursday’s speech, relations are again at a low.

On Friday, the Church of Divine Mercy, which withstood attack by paramilitaries, was overflowing with worshipers, most of them middle-class Nicaraguans. A priest read from the exorcism prayer of St. Michael the Archangel, who in Catholic teaching led legions of angels to do battle against Lucifer and his hosts, vanquishing them into the abyss.

In the overflow crowd outside the church, Félix Benavides, a driver, said he was there to show his solidarity with the church and the bishops. “We are here to back the bishops,” he said. “We think worse days are coming to Nicaragua.”

Bullet holes from a siege last week mark a wall of the Church of Divine Mercy in Managua, Nicaragua.

"It turns out that Russia has sown distrust in the U.S. political system—aided and abetted by the Democratic Party, and perhaps the FBI. This is an about-face from the dominant media narrative of the last year, and it requires a full investigation.

The Washington Post revealed Tuesday that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee jointly paid for that infamous “dossier” full of Russian disinformation against Donald Trump. They filtered the payments through a U.S. law firm (Perkins Coie), which hired the opposition-research hit men at Fusion GPS. Fusion in turn tapped a former British spook, Christopher Steele, to compile the allegations, which are based largely on anonymous, Kremlin-connected sources.

Strip out the middlemen, and it appears that Democrats paid for Russians to compile wild allegations about a U.S. presidential candidate. Did someone say “collusion”?

This news is all the more explosive because the DNC and Clinton campaign hid their role, even amid the media furor after BuzzFeed published the Steele dossier in January. Reporters are now saying that Clinton campaign officials lied to them about their role in the dossier. Current DNC Chair Tom Perez and former Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz deny knowing about the dossier arrangement, but someone must have known.

Perhaps this explains why Congressional Democrats have been keen to protect Fusion from answering dossier questions—disrupting hearings, protesting subpoenas and deriding Republican investigators. Two of Fusion’s cofounders invoked their Fifth Amendment rights last week rather than answer House Intelligence Committee questions, and Fusion filed a federal lawsuit on Friday to block committee subpoenas of its bank records.

Advertisement

The more troubling question is whether the FBI played a role, even if inadvertently, in assisting a Russian disinformation campaign. We know the agency possessed the dossier in 2016, and according to media reports it debated paying Mr. Steele to continue his work in the runup to the election. This occurred while former FBI Director James Comey was ramping up his probe into supposed ties between the Trump campaign and Russians.

Two pertinent questions: Did the dossier trigger the FBI probe of the Trump campaign, and did Mr. Comey or his agents use it as evidence to seek wiretapping approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Trump campaign aides?

Congressional investigators need to focus on the FBI’s role, and House Speaker Paul Ryan was correct Wednesday to insist that the bureau comply with Congress’s document demands “immediately.” Mr. Sessions has recused himself from the Justice Department’s Russia probe, but he and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein can still insist on transparency. Mr. Ryan should also reinstall Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes as lead on the Russia investigation, since it appears the Democratic accusations against him were aimed in part at throwing him off the Fusion trail.

All of this also raises questions about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The Fusion news means the FBI’s role in Russia’s election interference must now be investigated—even as the FBI and Justice insist that Mr. Mueller’s probe prevents them from cooperating with Congressional investigators.

Advertisement

Mr. Mueller is a former FBI director, and for years he worked closely with Mr. Comey. It is no slur against Mr. Mueller’s integrity to say that he lacks the critical distance to conduct a credible probe of the bureau he ran for a dozen years. He could best serve the country by resigning to prevent further political turmoil over that conflict of interest.

"National rivalries are a spicy ingredient at any Olympics—and that’s especially true when it comes to Korea and Japan, two countries whose historical strife is a hot theme at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.

Tensions between the divided Korean peninsula and its island neighbor have featured in numerous ways at these Olympics, from the Opening Ceremony to a recent women’s hockey match between Japan and the joint inter-Korean team.

This rivalry is set to take center stage again on Sunday when two-time Olympic gold medalist Lee Sang-hwa, 27, of South Korea, aims for a third gold in the women’s 500 meters long-track speedskating. Lee’s biggest rival is Japan’s Nao Kodaira, 30, who had a strong comeback last year when she took first place in the 500 meters competition at the Asian Winter Games, the World Cup and the World Single Distances Championships.

Lee and Kodaira’s match will be one of the most closely-watched races by locals at the 2018 Winter Olympics and—as with any match between South Korea and Japan—the stakes are high.

Lee set the world record in 500 meters at 36.36 seconds in 2013, which still remains unmatched. She landed gold in the same distance race in the 2010 and 2014 Olympics. But Lee’s ranking slipped behind her Japanese rival last year as she recovered from injuries.

Despite her superb performance at the world championships, Kodaira has had less luck at the Olympics. At her past two Olympics in Vancouver and Sochi, the Japanese skater came in 12th and 5th, never making it to the podium. But she has started strong in Pyeongchang, taking silver-—her first-ever Olympic medal—on Wednesday at the 1,000 meters race. Lee decided to skip that race to focus on her main 500 meters competition.

If Lee wins gold, she would be the second woman to win three consecutive golds in 500 meters since American skater Bonnie Blair, who came in first in 1988, 1992 and 1994.

Sunday’s competition comes against a backdrop of controversy between the two countries at the Pyeongchang Games.

At the opening ceremony, NBC came under fire when a commentator, Joshua Cooper Ramo, remarked on how Koreans universally looked up to Japan as a “cultural and technical and economic example.” Ramo’s comment outraged Koreans who criticized him for glossing over Japan’s brutal 35-year-long colonial occupation of Korea.

Shortly after Ramo’s comment, NBC’s Twitter and Instagram accounts were flooded with criticisms from Koreans.

Ramo posted an apology on his Twitter account Wednesday, saying that he “did not intend to minimize or disrespect a part of Korean history that must never be forgotten.”

While Japanese colonial rule ended in 1945, its legacy remains a delicate issue in South Korean society. Every Wednesday, protesters gather in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul to demand a formal apology from Tokyo for forcing Korean women to provide sexual services to Japanese soldiers during World War II. When Japanese prime ministers visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine—a memorial to Japan’s 2.5 million war dead that also enshrines some convicted war criminals—it generates anger and headlines in South Korea.

Japan also decried the use of a unified flag of the Korean peninsula during the Opening Ceremony last week that included a small dot representing a disputed islet claimed by both Korea and Japan. The islet, known as Dokdo in Korean and as Takeshima in Japanese, is controlled by South Korea, but claimed by Japan.

Japan successfully lobbied for the two Koreas to use a unified flag that omitted the small dot. A spokesman for South Korea’s foreign ministry said Korea would remove the dot out of respect for the International Olympic Committee’s efforts to avoid political disputes during the Games.

Lee and Kodaira say they are just focusing on their competition. At a recent interview with South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency, Lee asked reporters not to draw comparisons between her and Kodaira, adding that the result would simply “depend on how well (she) handles pressure.” Kodaira told the same outlet that she wanted to have “a good match” with Lee.

"BRUSSELS—As if the European Union didn’t have enough to worry about, now it’s at odds over what should be its dominant language.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, wants to make French grand again and replace English as the default language in EU institutions, the way it was before Britain joined the bloc in 1973. With the U.K. negotiating to leave the EU next spring, he is eager to restore the linguistic ancien regime.

“English has probably never been so present in Brussels as when we’re talking about Brexit,” Mr. Macron said in March on the Day of Francophonie—a celebration of French language and culture observed in more than 70 countries. “This domination is not inevitable,” he declared.

Dethroning the Queen’s English looks nearly impossible for the soon-to-be 27-country bloc. Its 24 official languages produce 552 translating combinations—an impractically large number that demands a shortcut.

English is by far the leading foreign language taught in the EU, according to official statistics. Over 80% of primary-school children and over 95% of secondary-school students across the bloc learn English before any other foreign language.

Still, Brexit means a downgrading for English. Today it’s the official language for 12.8% of the EU’s 511 million people but after Britain leaves it will be just the second official language in just two countries: Ireland and Malta. Combined they represent 1.2% of the EU’s post-Brexit population.

Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, known for her pithy tweets during EU leaders’ meetings, said any decision regarding the bloc’s linguistic regime “cannot be divorced from reality.”

“English is the most popular language of communication in the EU and people will continue to use it. Especially given that it is one of the official languages in Ireland and Malta,” Ms. Grybauskaite said.

A more modest, but perhaps not less daunting, challenge is improving the EU’s English. The bloc’s main translating body says 81% of EU documents are drafted in English, 5% in French, 2% in German and the rest in the 21 other languages. Yet only 2.8% of EU staff are British.

That imbalance prompted Jeremy Gardner, an English translator from Windsor, to write a handbook of words and phrases frequently misused in the EU. Mr. Gardner, who spent most of his professional life in Italy and Luxembourg, published the last edition two years ago—just one month before Britain voted to go it alone.

Some quirks of EU English his lexicon attempts to correct: An EU document too frequently doesn’t “say” something—it “foresees” it. Many staff are known as “contractual agents.” Instead of cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys, EU documents speak of “bovine, ovine, caprine and asinine animals.”

The word “axis” is used to denote programs that have a high priority within the EU’s bureaucracy. The European Commission—the bloc’s civil service—has, among others, a fisheries axis, a social policy axis and a technology transfer axis.

Much of the odd phrasing is the result of half-translations from French. Officials go “on mission” rather than taking business trips. They draft “fiches,” not documents, and talk about “enterprises” rather than companies.

The EU uses the term “comitology” to denote a decision-making process among national experts from the 28 countries. The jargon is likely taken from a French word that means a committee procedure. The word “comitology” was also used in 1957 by Cyril Northcote Parkinson, a British writer, to refer to the study of how committees and government cabinets are created and eventually grow irrelevant.

For centuries, French was the language of European affairs and international diplomacy. When Mr. Gardner joined in 1991, his orientation courses in Luxembourg were offered mostly in French.

Vestiges of French pre-eminence linger at the U.S. State Department, which still sends démarches to foreign governments, rather than just letters, and issues communiqués, not simply statements. U.S. ambassadors have a No. 2 called a chargé d’affaires.

U.S. ascendancies in the last century helped English eclipse French. Victory in the Cold War sealed English’s lock on Europe because almost everyone in ex-communist countries between Germany and Russia picked English as their preferred second language.

Now Mr. Macron is making a stand. His recently appointed ambassador to the EU, Philippe Léglise-Costa, walked out of a budget meeting in April because English was the only working language.

“Everyone was happy to speak in English, but once he made a fuss, the others also started demanding interpretation into their national languages,” said a Nordic diplomat in the room. “They got their French interpretation for the next meeting, but I’m sure eventually everyone will start talking English again,” the diplomat said.

Mr. Macron said he wants to “set some rules, to be present, and make French the language with which one has access to a number of opportunities.” He pledged to offer more French classes to EU officials and to beef up its international network of French-speaking schools.

One Macron ally in the battle to restore French is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a native from neighboring Luxembourg, who frequently delivers public remarks in French and German.

“Why would Shakespeare’s language be superior to that of Voltaire?” Mr. Juncker said on French TV recently. “We are wrong to have become so anglicized,” he said, in French.

Mr. Gardner recently retired from the EU’s Court of Auditors, which isn’t actually a court. (Its name comes from, you guessed it, French.) While scoffing at the notion of Brexit restoring French as the bloc’s pre-eminent tongue, he predicts it could open the door to something more revolutionary: American English.

"President Trump accused China of trying to interfere in the midterm U.S. elections, opening up an unexpected front in his administration’s multi-sided conflict with a chief global adversary.

Mr. Trump said Beijing was trying to damage him politically and hurt the Republican Party over growing trade disputes, in part by using newspaper ads to target voters in areas most affected by retaliatory Chinese tariffs.

The accusation on Wednesday added to an expanding list of grievances between the two global economic powers, spanning trade, territorial claims in the South China Sea, military cooperation and espionage.

The rising number of issues where tensions have emerged threatens to turn what had been a rivalry into open confrontation between Washington and Beijing.

After Mr. Trump initially made friendly personal overtures to Chinese President Xi Jinping, the U.S. leader on Wednesday said he thought the two men were possibly no longer friends because of the trade dispute. Mr. Trump said he would call Mr. Xi to discuss the trade matter on Thursday.

During a press conference Wednesday, President Trump took questions from reporters on a range of topics including Nafta, China, Brett Kavanaugh and Rod Rosenstein. These are the highlights. Photo: Associated Press

In the latest sign of discord, Mr. Trump charged that the Chinese had mounted a campaign to meddle in the midterm elections in November. He didn’t present evidence showing China was seeking to influence U.S. politics to the level of Russia’s covert campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

“Regrettably, we’ve found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election coming up in November against my administration,” Mr. Trump said in his opening remarks while chairing the United Nations Security Council as other countries sought to focus on issues related to nuclear nonproliferation.

“They do not want me—or us—to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade.”

On Twitter later in the day, Mr. Trump accused China of “placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers, made to look like news.”

“That’s because we are beating them on Trade, opening markets, and the farmers will make a fortune when this is over!” he wrote.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who attended the Security Council meeting, denied any intervention by China in elections in the U.S. or elsewhere.

“China has all along followed the policy of noninterference in other countries’ affairs,” Mr. Wang said. “We did not and will not interfere in any other countries’ affairs. We refuse to accept any unwarranted accusations against China.”

Chinese state media bought a four-page advertising insert in the Des Moines Register in Iowa this week. The advertisement said Chinese President Xi Jinping studied in the state on a college exchange and said Beijing could “be an example for the world.”

Such foreign media advertising in U.S. newspapers are relatively common, for other countries as well as China.

A senior administration official said during a press call that China’s behavior had “reached an unacceptable level” that went “well beyond how most other countries interact with each other.” The official added China’s practices included “cyber” activities but the official didn’t elaborate.

Vice President Mike Pence will deliver a speech next week laying out more specific detail about China’s malign influence activities, the official said.

Mr. Trump’s accusation of election meddling followed increased tit-for-tat disputes with Beijing over trade and military affairs.

The U.S. has alleged that China forces U.S. firms to transfer technology to their Chinese partners. On Monday, the U.S. levied 10% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, bringing the total Chinese imports hit by U.S. levies to $250 billion, or about half of Chinese imports to the U.S.

China has matched the U.S. actions with its own tariffs on $110 billion on U.S. imports into China, which is about 85% of what the U.S. exports to Beijing. Much of those Chinese tariffs hit U.S. agricultural goods, like soybeans and pork, produced in counties that voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump in the 2016 election.

Mr. Trump and his advisers point to the Chinese tariffs as evidence that Beijing is targeting the Republican base in an effort to affect the midterm elections. Last week Mr. Trump tweeted that “China has openly stated that they are actively trying to affect and change our election by attacking our farmers, ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me.”

But given the scale of the Chinese tariffs, it was inevitable they would hit a big export item like agriculture. Also Beijing is far from the only country to look to sway Congress through tariffs when it is in a trade battle with the U.S.

Adding to tensions, the Chinese government this week denied a U.S. Navy ship permission for a port visit to Hong Kong next month, retaliating for sanctions slapped on a Chinese military agency that had purchased Russian combat aircraft and a surface-to-air missile system.

Additionally, a growing number of Chinese espionage cases—involving Chinese nationals or former U.S. officials recruited by Beijing’s intelligence services—have been brought to public trial in recent months, as the Justice Department has sought to deter the theft of intellectual property or national security secrets.

On Tuesday, prosecutors said they had arrested a 27-year-old Chinese national who attended college in the United States and enlisted in the Army for allegedly spying on U.S. engineers.

Also in recent weeks, the Justice Department ordered Xinhua News Agency and China Global Television Network, two leading Chinese state-run media organizations, to register as foreign agents.

Still, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Mr. Xi, repeating in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that it had been “a pleasure and an honor” to work with the Chinese leader.

And Mr. Trump spurned the advice of national security officials and Republicans and Democrats in Congress this summer when he granted China’s ZTE Corp. a reprieve from a ban that would have banned U.S. companies from selling components to the telecommunications giant.

Mr. Trump didn’t mention Russian interference during his U.N. remarks on Wednesday, before the Security Council. Top U.S. intelligence officials have warned publicly in recent weeks that Russia is engaging in a “pervasive” effort to interfere in the midterm elections.

U.S. lawmakers from both parties have criticized Mr. Trump for underplaying the threat posed by Moscow and for embracing the denials of Russian President Vladimir Putin about 2016 election interference over the unanimous assessment of the U.S. intelligence community, which concluded the Kremlin orchestrated a multipronged cyber operation to boost Mr. Trump’s candidacy.

U.S. intelligence officials have repeatedly raised the possibility that others besides Russia could attempt to interfere in American elections.

There is “of course” concern about the possibility that Beijing or others would try to influence U.S. elections, one U.S. official said, who declined to discuss specific intelligence reports.

Chinese hackers breached the campaigns of both Barack Obama and John McCain during the 2008 election, according to U.S. officials. But Beijing and others haven’t previously engaged in a sophisticated operation to the scale of Russia’s 2016 meddling attempting to achieve a specific outcome of an election, officials have said.

Most of the focus around securing the midterms elections has so far been on deterring Russia from launching another sophisticated influence operation, but other adversaries have come under scrutiny for their online influence operations in recent months as well.

Technology companies including Facebook and YouTube disclosed Iran-linked misinformation campaigns on their platforms last month.

Despite the attention Russia’s election interference and efforts to sow political discord in the U.S. have received, China remains a top long-term strategic threat, top U.S. intelligence officials have said.

“China often executes its strategy in a more deliberate and subtle manner” than Russia, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats said Tuesday at an intelligence conference in South Carolina.

Seated alongside Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday, Mr. Trump repeated his assertion that China is “trying to meddle in our elections,” without offering details, adding, “we’re not going to let that happen, just as we’re not going to let that happen with Russia.”

"Just after Labor Day 2016, when the U.S. presidential race was entering full swing, columnist George F. Will urged Congress to undertake a seemingly futile gesture: He wanted the House to impeach John Koskinen, commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.

Mr. Koskinen had taken over as head of the IRS after it had been exposed for singling out for mistreatment conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status. He lied to Congress when he said he had produced all of Lois Lerner’s emails, allowed documents under subpoena to be destroyed, and generally behaved in a way that helped ensure there would be no hard consequences for the abuses. Though Mr. Koskinen had only a few months left on the job, Mr. Will argued that impeaching him might help Congress restore its much diminished standing as a coequal branch of government.

Not quite two years later, Congress continues to pay the price for letting Ms. Lerner and Mr. Koskinen ride freely into the sunset. Though the IRS and other federal agencies—including the State and Justice Departments, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation—are now headed by Trump rather than Obama appointees, they continue to spurn congressional oversight demands with near impunity.

Here’s one example: When House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes subpoenaed documents and testimony from the FBI and Justice Department, he was stonewalled for months. In a last-minute bid to circumvent the committee’s demands, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with Speaker Paul Ryan. The two men ended up agreeing to comply with the subpoenas—but only because Mr. Ryan informed them they would be found in contempt if they did not.

This kind of stonewalling has fed the agitation on Capitol Hill for a second special counsel, who would look into everything from the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email investigation to the use of the Christopher Steele dossier to obtain warrants to listen in on members of the Trump campaign. The calls are mistaken. But the frustration is real, and the people demanding a new special counsel—from Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham in the Senate to Kevin McCarthy and Bob Goodlatte in the House—are no fringe players.

These calls proceed despite an imminent report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department’s inspector general. The report promises to reveal telling details about what went on at Justice and the FBI, including why the FBI itself would come to recommend the firing of Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. But those pushing for a special counsel say an inspector general is not enough, because he has limited power to subpoena and no power to indict.

All this is true. But missing here is any discussion of the powers Congress itself has, including but not limited to the subpoena and contempt powers that ultimately forced Mr. Wray and Mr. Rosenstein into compliance.

If it only has the backbone, Congress can get what it wants out of the federal bureaucracy. Several executive-branch officials—including Justice’s Bruce Ohr and FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page—will soon testify before the House Intelligence Committee. Possibly some or all of them will invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

If Congress insists on its prerogatives, however, that wouldn’t be the end of the story. Witnesses who plead the Fifth can still be compelled to testify. The price is that the compelled testimony, and evidence derived from that testimony, couldn’t be used against the witness in a prosecution.

A special counsel might not like this, given his emphasis on indictments and prosecutions. But Congress should, because its end goal is political accountability. Which would be up to the American people to impose after learning exactly what abuses have transpired.

Of course, Congress has its own ways of showing its displeasure, including cutting the budgets of recalcitrant agencies. Given budget rules, this would require the cooperation of some Democrats, who are unlikely to go along. Nevertheless, the power of the purse remains a tool Congress can use to make the executive branch pay a price for its actions.

Above all, there is impeachment. The constitutional power to remove officials from office for “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors” is a writ far broader than anything a special counsel enjoys.

Then again, it’s not easy to impeach a federal official, and it shouldn’t be. As Mr. Will pointed out in his column calling for Mr. Koskinen’s impeachment, “no appointed official of the executive branch has been impeached in 140 years.” Mr. Koskinen was not impeached, and he and Ms. Lerner rode off into the sunset without having to answer for their actions and deceits.

Ask yourself this: Is it likely our federal agencies would be so haughty about Congress and its subpoenas if Mr. Koskinen had been impeached?

So instead of whingy calls for another special counsel, a Congress that behaved as a branch of government coequal to the presidency would use its own powers to force oversight on resisting federal officials. Even if this might ultimately include impeaching FBI Director Christopher Wray.

"WARSAW—Tens of thousands of Poles marched across downtown Warsaw on Saturday, in an independence-day procession organized by a nationalist youth movement that seeks an ethnically pure Poland with fewer Jews or Muslims.

The largely young crowd shot off roman candles and many chanted “fatherland,” carrying banners that read “White Europe,” “Europe Will Be White” and “Clean Blood.” Some of the marchers flew in from Hungary, Slovakia and Spain and waved flags and symbols that those countries used during their wartime collaboration with Nazi Germany.

A number of people in the crowd said they didn’t belong to any neo-fascist or racist organization but didn’t see a problem with the overall tone of what has become Poland’s biggest independence day event.

“There are of course nationalists and fascists at this march,” said Mateusz, a 27-year-old wrapped in a Polish flag, “I’m fine with it. I’m just happy to be here.”

The march, organized by a group called the National Radical Camp, underscores the rightward politics of a growing section of Polish youth. The Radical Camp presents itself as the heir to a 1930s fascist movement of the same name, which fought to rid Poland of Jews in the years just before the Holocaust. A second group, All Polish Youth, also named after an anti-Jewish interwar movement, co-organized it.

Officials in the city government said they thought the march reflected poorly on Poland, but they said they had no choice but to approve the demonstration, as it fulfilled the legal requirements: It qualified as a celebration of Polish history. “This is not the type of event I would take my children to,” said Agnieszka Kłąb, spokesperson for the Warsaw City Council.

The Radical Camp has been holding independence-day marches since 2009. Until several years ago, it struggled to attract more than a few hundred people. In the past three years, it has become the largest independence-day occasion in Poland, and one of the largest nationalist marches of its kind anywhere in Europe. Saturday’s was expected to be the largest ever. Police estimated the crowd at 60,000.

“It’s getting more and more vicious,” said Jakub Skrzypek, 25, one of about a dozen counterprotesters standing behind a banner that read “We Are Polish Jews” and surrounded by police. “We are really in fear.”

The Radical Camp’s followers argue, on their social-media accounts and in their literature, that the influx of Syrian refugees into Europe is part of a conspiracy driven by Jewish financiers, who are working with Communists in the European Union to bring Muslims into Europe, and with them, Shariah law and homosexuality.

The group has regularly held events to mark a 1936 pogrom against Jews. Its symbols were displayed on a banner that appeared over a bridge in Poznan, reading: “Pray for Islamic Holocaust.”

This year, the group said it was adopting a new slogan—“We want God”—a nod to President Donald Trump, who in a July speech here quoted that saying, which comes from a traditional Polish song.

“This march is just an expression of a bigger social phenomenon, which is definitely very troubling, and is the growing acceptance of extreme nationalism and xenophobia among young people in Poland,” said Rafal Pankowski, a political-science professor at private university Collegium Civitas in Warsaw. “It is a contrast: Polish parents and grandparents are paradoxically more liberal than their young.”

Richard Spencer, an American until recently banned from 26 European countries who wants to create a country just for white people in North America, was invited. The Polish government asked him to stay home, and he didn’t show up. Roberto Fiore, an Italian anti-immigration politician who describes himself as a fascist, was scheduled to appear.

Some Poles on Facebook and Twitter said they were staying away from the city center on their country’s independence day, to avoid potential violence. Three previous years’ marches devolved into tear-gas-clouded scuffles with police. Police detained at least 45 people Saturday.

The crowds drawn to Saturday’s march reflect the politics taking hold in the soccer clubs and youth hangouts where Radical Camp recruits. The group holds a staunch nativist standpoint, saying the European Union and Russia represent equal threats to Polish sovereignty. It argues that Polish people should nationalize the assets belonging to foreign corporations and distribute the profits across an ethnically homogenous state

Similar movements have taken hold—even captured seats in parliament—in Hungary, Slovakia and Czech Republic. Some of these countries are among Europe’s most prospering. Poland is the only country in the EU that didn’t experience a single quarter of economic contraction after the financial crisis.

Still, the fear that Poland is under siege by distant elites has captured the imagination of some here, as has the worry that hordes of immigrants could soon pour over the border. Government-controlled media broadcasts near-nightly reports on crimes committed by Muslims in Europe. On Saturday, Polish state television called the procession a “great march of patriots.

“It’s like this inner need we have,” said Lukasz, a 24-year-old protester. “We want a Poland that will be for Polish people.”

"MUNICH—European officials are intensifying their efforts to save the Iranian nuclear deal, opening a new channel to press Tehran to curtail its military involvement in neighboring conflicts just as tensions spiral throughout the Middle East.

European diplomats sat down with a senior Iranian official over the weekend on the sidelines of a major security conference in Munich. They hope to check Iranian activity in Yemen, Syria and other parts of the Middle East as a way to show U.S. President Donald Trump that Iranian expansion can be reversed while sticking with the nuclear agreement.

Mr. Trump has threatened to kill the Iranian nuclear deal in May, when he must decide whether to keep in place sanctions waivers required under the 2015 agreement. The nuclear deal lifted most international sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran tightly restricting its nuclear program.

Administration officials have complained the 2015 agreement does nothing to check Iran’s regional actions. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Sunday Tehran had “doubled down” on its regional meddling after concluding the deal.

U.S. national security adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster on Saturday accused Iran of building a network of proxy forces, like Hezbollah, and arming them with increasingly sophisticated weaponry.

“So the time is now…to act against Iran,” Gen. McMaster said in Munich.

Chaired by the European Union, the meeting on Saturday morning was attended by senior officials from Italy, Germany, Britain and France, and Iran’s powerful Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, also a key player in negotiating the nuclear deal. The focus of discussions was the conflict in Yemen, according to Western and Iranian officials.

Those officials said talks will likely turn to Syria, the scene of escalating tensions, in particular between Iran and Israel.

Earlier this month, Israel launched attacks on Syrian air defenses and Iranian fighters in Syria after Israel intercepted an Iranian drone launched from Syria. An Israeli jet was shot down during the attacks.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned in Munich on Sunday that Israel won’t accept an Iranian presence close to its border in southern Syria and could strike Iran directly if Tehran doesn’t back away.

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has agreed to start discussing Tehran’s involvement in regional conflicts, but said that if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to kill the nuclear deal, Iran ‘will respond seriously.’ Photo: ronald wittek/EPA/Shutterstock

“We will act without hesitation to defend ourselves,” he said. “And we will act if necessary not just against Iran’s proxies but against Iran itself.”

European governments, which have strongly supported the Iranian nuclear agreement, have pledged to work with Washington to address nonnuclear concerns, such as Iran’s missile program and its regional activities. However they say this should happen separate from discussion on the nuclear deal and that they won’t renegotiate the 2015 deal.

European and U.S. officials set up working groups last month to discuss these issues. Around the same time, the Europeans agreed with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to start discussing regional issues in the new format.

Over the weekend, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned that while the EU would maintain its support for the Iranian nuclear deal, Europe was ready to work with the U.S. against “the destabilizing influence of Iranian policies in the region and to push them back.”

France has said Iranian firms or people could be targeted with new sanctions over its missile program.

Iran has refused to enter discussions on ballistic missiles, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who controls security policy, saying on Sunday that Western countries want to keep Iran weak so they can “bully them.” Iranian officials note Western countries are making large arms sales to their regional foes, like Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Iranian officials have called on Europe to stick by the nuclear deal. Mr. Zarif warned on Sunday that if the nuclear deal is undermined, “Iran will respond, will respond seriously.”

Iranian officials said they have long called for more active European diplomacy on regional tensions. However it is unclear whether they will give any ground in talks. While EU economic sanctions give the bloc some leverage, Europe has no significant military presence in the region to curtail Iran’s ambitions.

On Sunday on his semiofficial Twitter feed, Mr. Khamenei lambasted European countries for bowing to U.S. pressure on Iran.

“On nuclear talks, we trusted them,” he said of Western governments. “we didn’t benefit from that trust.”

European officials have said that to work with Washington on their concerns about Iran, they expect Mr. Trump to end uncertainty over the nuclear deal’s fate. Many complain that the U.S. demands for sticking by the deal remain vague.

In Munich, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan sought to respond to that. He said that by the time of Mr. Trump’s next Iran deal deadline on May 12, Washington hoped to win “a commitment that we can…credibly show to the president (that) we’re making progress” to address the deal’s flaws and Iran’s missiles and regional actions.

"A Chinese middleman who is allegedly one of the largest facilitators of North Korean trade invested around $500,000 with his wife in a fund that put them on a path toward becoming U.S. permanent residents, according to a court document filed on Thursday.

Law-enforcement officials seized the funds in October, and the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington filed a complaint Thursday to forfeit the funds from Chi Yupeng and his wife, Zhang Bing.

The disclosure appears to expose a loophole in the much-debated EB-5 visa program that allowed the pair to make the investment in 2015, and remain invested in the project until the funds were seized, despite being on a U.S. sanctions list.

Mr. Chi and his company were added in August to a Treasury Department list of entities and people who the U.S. government says help facilitate North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program. On that same day, the U.S. attorney’s office filed a case seeking to forfeit other funds Mr. Chi’s company allegedly tried to route through U.S. banks.

The Washington-based C4ADS, which studies transnational threats, has previously identified Mr. Chi’s company, Dandong Zhicheng, as the biggest importer of North Korean goods into China. Prosecutors have alleged the company helped facilitate North Korea’s coal trade, which the U.S. has estimated generates more than $1 billion in revenue a year for North Korea and helps fuel its weapons programs.

The couple couldn't be reached for comment. An attorney for them couldn't immediately be located.

The new forfeiture filing comes as the Trump administration is pressing Chinese officials to expel North Korean agents helping finance Pyongyang’s nuclear-weapons and missile programs. The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on 16 North Korean agents accused of operating largely in China as representatives of North Korea’s banned banks and weapons programs.

The EB-5 program offers green cards to aspiring immigrants who invest at least $500,000 in U.S. businesses in high-unemployment or rural areas that have been determined to create at least 10 jobs per investor. A green card permits a foreign national to live and work in the U.S.

The majority of EB-5 visas go to wealthy Chinese individuals, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security. The U.S. government limits the number of EB-5 visas to 10,000 a year.

The EB-5 program has been criticized for favoring wealthy immigrants and for channeling most of the funds to upscale neighborhoods, rather than the economically disadvantaged areas for which the program was intended.

Some developers and middlemen who have raised money through the program also have been alleged to be involved in fraudulent schemes aimed at taking advantage of applicants.

Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been examining the use of the EB-5 program by the real-estate company run by the family of Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. A spokeswoman for Kushner Cos. has previously said the company fully complied with EB-5 rules and regulations and did nothing improper.

Thursday’s complaint appears to be one of the first instances of alleged misconduct on the part of an investor seeking to obtain a visa through the program.

The filing, which amends an earlier complaint targeting other funds, says a U.S. bank account maintained by a family member of Mr. Chi and Ms. Zhang received a series of wire transfers in November 2015. Immediately following those transfers, that account wired $550,100 to a regional EB-5 investment program, referencing Ms. Zhang.

Ms. Zhang and Mr. Chi have applied for an EB-5 visa, the complaint said. Ms. Zhang also told the U.S. government at an immigration checkpoint in June 2016 that she and Mr. Chi were planning to become investment immigrants, the document said.

Prosecutors also said the initial 12 wire transfers to the relative’s U.S. account each fell under $50,000, which appeared designed to avoid a Chinese government limit of $50,000 per year on foreign capital outflow by any one individual.

The complaint cited two North Korean defectors who said people behind North Korea’s financial facilitators frequently use accounts in their own names or those of family members, rather than those of their better-known companies, to move U.S. dollars and circumvent prohibitions on using the U.S. financial system.

"UNITED NATIONS—Iran has arrested a British-Iranian dual citizen who traveled to Tehran from London on an invitation to speak at an academic workshop, according to friends of his family and human-rights organizations.

Abbas Edalat, a professor of computer science and mathematics at Imperial College and a British-Iranian dual citizen, was arrested in Tehran, friends of the family said.

The arrest of Abbas Edalat, a professor of computer science and mathematics at Imperial College in London, comes at a time of particularly tense relations between Iran and the West over the fate of the nuclear deal.

Europe has assumed the role of liaison between Tehran and Washington, appealing simultaneously to U.S. President Donald Trump to remain committed to the nuclear deal and to Iranian officials to negotiate for a broader agreement touching on regional policy and ballistic missiles.

Some Security Council diplomats said interactions with Iran were tense, adding that their priority remained to sail smoothly past the U.S.’s May 12 deadline for recertifying the nuclear deal without a major confrontation over other issues, including dual-national detainees.

“We are urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities following reports of the arrest of a British-Iranian dual national,” the British Foreign Office said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal.

Iran holds nearly a dozen dual and foreign nationals in prison, including two other British citizens, five Americans, one Austrian and one Swede. They have been charged with espionage and threatening national security and sentenced to a decade or more of prison in closed-door trials. A Canadian-Iranian professor and environmentalist, Kavous Seyed Emami, died in prison in February under questionable circumstances, family members said. His wife, Maryam Mombeini, also a Canadian, is banned from leaving Iran.

Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said this week that Iran would be open to negotiating a prisoner swap for dual nationals with the U.S. if Mr. Trump changes his posture, tone and behavior toward Iran. The U.S. has made at least three overtures to Iran since January for prisoner negotiations but hasn’t received a reply, according to U.S. officials and families of American detainees.

“Talk is only possible when there is mutual respect. I said, without mutual respect, a dialogue will get nowhere,” Mr. Zarif said on Monday at a talk in New York.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have arrested 30 Iranian dual nationals since the signing of the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in 2015, according to the Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based group.

“Iran will continue to detain dual nationals and use them as political playing cards until countries with leverage, including the U.K., forcefully demand that Iran cease the practice of hostage-taking once and for all,” said Hadi Ghaemi, the group’s executive director.

Mr. Edalat, an unmarried middle-aged man with sisters in Iran and the U.S., is an accomplished math and computer-science scholar. Earlier this month he won an award from his university for a computer-science paper he had co-written with a colleague.

In Iran, Mr. Edalat has been known for bringing computers from Britain and giving them to Iranian children in need. He is a vocal antiwar and anti-sanctions activist, staging protests, appearing on television as an analyst, and founding a U.S.-based advocacy to promote his views.

“Iran’s nuclear program is completely peaceful,” Mr. Edalat said on CNBC in 2102 denouncing international sanctions against Iran as a pretext for war. “What is in [the West’s] mind is regime change, in the same way they wanted regime change in Iraq.”

Security forces raided Mr. Edalat’s family home in Tehran on April 15 and arrested him, according to friends of the family and human-rights organizations, who said he was taken to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps intelligence wing in Evin prison. They said security forces also confiscated his computer, phone, notebooks and compact discs.

The charges against Mr. Edalat are unknown and he has had no access to a lawyer, friends of the family said. Iranian officials in Iran haven’t commented on Mr. Edalat’s arrest, and Iran’s Mission to the U.N. didn’t respond to a request for comment.

“We are urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities following reports of the arrest of a British-Iranian dual national,” the British Foreign Office said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal.

The Revolutionary Court in Tehran set bail but denied the family’s efforts to post it on April 21, according to human-rights agencies, which said the family made a second unsuccessful attempt to post bail on Wednesday.

“This is terrifying. [Mr. Edalat] has for years been working for the cause of education for all in Iran. There is not a kinder person than him,” Iranian journalist Nazli Kamvari wrote on Twitter.

"The German government never had so much money or so many ideas about how to spend it. The one thing that isn’t being discussed is giving it back to taxpayers.

Tax cuts—a fixture of the political debate in the U.S., where the government hasn’t balanced its books in decades—are barely on the agenda here, even though Germany’s next government is expected to post a consolidated budget surplus of roughly €50 billion ($62 billion) between now and 2021, according to finance ministry calculations.

“It is sort of a through-the-looking-glass world,” said John Kornblum, a former U.S. ambassador to Germany, of the two countries’ differing attitudes. “Traditionally Germans have been in favor of hoarding resources rather than lowering government expenditures.”

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s new government, set to come into office next month if her coalition partner approves the alliance, will be no exception. Its 177-page policy platform includes only one small tax cut worth €10 billion over four years and limited to low earners, next to nearly €50 billion of spending on child care, education, infrastructure and welfare benefits.

Despite the state’s overflowing coffers, Ms. Merkel’s conservatives had to talk their left-leaning partners out of raising taxes during the tense negotiations over the coalition agreement.

The aversion to discussing tax cuts on business profits and personal income is surprising, many economists argue, because Germany—despite its cultivated self-image as a stronghold of fiscal rectitude—has among the highest taxes in the world and a habit of heavy state spending.

The tax wedge—the share of wages that workers and businesses pay in tax and other mandatory levies—is 49.4%, second only to Belgium among the 35 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Total government spending, meanwhile, has risen around 10% since 2014. At 45% of gross domestic product, it is 9 percentage points higher than in the U.S.

‘ You need high taxes in order to be civilized. ’ —Sven Giegold of the Green Party

Lower corporate and income taxes could lead to higher spending and investment, boost imports and lower the nation’s giant trade surplus, economists say. That would please trading partners such as the U.S. which have chafed at Germany’s record run of current-account surpluses—a measure of excess savings in the economy.

“It would be better for [Germany’s] long-term growth prospects if the tax system were less heavy on labor,” said Andrés Fuentes, an economist with the OECD in Paris.

Yet the perception of tax cuts in the country’s political mainstream ranges from slightly shameful to outright evil. Many conservatives see them as overindulgent toward voters, while the center-left views them as morally indefensible gifts to the rich. All parties, with the exception of the pro-business Free Democrats, favor a high degree of redistribution.

“You need high taxes in order to be civilized,” said Sven Giegold, who represents Germany’s Green Party in the European Parliament. “We are very far away from the government having too much money.” The federal audit office, meanwhile, has expressed concerns about the fiscal challenges of providing for an aging population and infrastructure investment.

Only one-fifth of Germans think the federal surplus is reason to cut tax, according to a poll in July by Infratest Dimap. More than half said the government should spend the money on investments, and another fifth wanted to pay down the national debt faster.

Germany’s gross national debt amounted to 65% of GDP last year, compared with 97% for France, 108% for the U.S. and 240% for Japan, according to the IMF. The national debt is expected to fall to 50% of GDP in Germany by 2022, while that in the other countries is expected to drift down very slowly or—in the case of the U.S.—to rise.

Yet even the German Taxpayers’ Association has said the focus should be on repaying debt, though it has called for some limited tax cuts.

The stigma around tax cuts means not just the federal government, but also towns small and big up and down the country are awash in money—and not always sure what to do with it.

In Eschborn, a town of 22,000 near Frankfurt with €212 million in its coffers, Mayor Mathias Geiger recently proposed to local officials a tax cut for businesses. The town council rejected it. The urge to save, Mr. Geiger observed philosophically, is anchored “deep in the German soul.”

To be sure, taxes in Germany, as in other European countries, cover a range of highly popular social benefits, including universal health care and state pensions. The last time income-tax rates dropped in a big way was under Ms. Merkel’s predecessor, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who cut taxes in the early 2000s in a bid to boost a then-stagnant economy. Most individual income over €54,000 is effectively taxed at about 44% for single taxpayers, with a surtax on earnings over €256,000.

Germany’s corporate tax rate has fallen to around 30% from more than 55% in the late 1990s. But that level will soon be the highest among the Group of 7 major economies, potentially putting German companies at a disadvantage in international markets.

The growth rate of Germany’s capital stock is falling behind that of the U.S. and France, and even lagging behind Italy’s by some measures, says Guntram Wolff, director of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. Incentivizing corporate investment should be a priority for the next government, he said.

Corporate-tax cuts are deeply unpopular, however. “The social discourse is, if you cut corporate-tax rates further, it’s basically a race to the bottom,” Mr. Wolff said.

EBM Papst, a manufacturer of electric motors in the southern German region of Baden-Württemberg, plans to take advantage of lower U.S. taxes to expand its North American footprint. But because of taxes at home, its chief executive, Stefan Brandl, worries about being at a disadvantage to his American competitors.

“A new German government should see it as important to support firms and not burden them with bureaucracy that weakens the competitive situation,” Mr. Brandl said.

Andreas Povel, a former general manager of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany, says German politicians “are in an extraordinary comfort zone” that blinds them from the need to keep state spending in check. German firms are likely to invest more in the U.S. to take advantage of the recent corporate-tax cut there rather than at home, Mr. Povel said.

Back in Eschborn, work is about to start on a new building for emergency services, a sport hall, a youth center, and an expansion of the public swimming pool. An expansion of the town hall and a new convention center will have to wait until staff can process them.

“We don’t have many millionaires here, but the town itself is a millionaire,” said Mr. Geiger.

RAMALLAH, West Bank—Palestinians angry over their dysfunctional government and decrepit infrastructure are souring on Mahmoud Abbas, as the U.S. questions the 83-year-old leader’s interest in peace talks with Israel.

Protests, once rare, have broken out in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, which Mr. Abbas heads as president. Demonstrators last month clashed with security forces.

More than 60% of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza want Mr. Abbas to resign, according to a public-opinion poll released Wednesday by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research.

Still, 64% of Palestinians say they worry that if Mr. ​Abbas leaves politics, it could spark turmoil and insecurity because he has no clear successor.

The president is now in the 13th year of what initially was meant to be a four-year term and has been in and out of the hospital in recent months. He shows no signs of relinquishing power.

A spokesman for Mr. Abbas didn’t respond to questions about criticism of his leadership. Aides defended Mr. Abbas as an important figure who has helped shape Palestinian institutions.

But some acknowledged that progress toward a deal with Israel and improvements in daily life haven’t come fast enough.

“We have never reached this level of weakness in front of our people,” said Saeb Erekat, a 63-year-old top aide to Mr. Abbas.

“At the end of the day, governing is not about how decent you are and how honest you are,” Mr. Erekat said. “You promised your people you do something. You didn’t.”

Crumbling public services have generated frustration. Mounds of garbage piled up on the streets of Ramallah last month during a strike by sanitation workers. At the Palestine Medical Complex in the city, patients complain about poorly trained medical personnel and inadequate equipment.

“You can’t give security all the budget and leave the patient with nothing,” said Atef​Abu Qubita, 47, who was getting treatment for diabetes.

Mr. Abbas’s fragile position is adding to skepticism about the success of any peace plan advanced by the Trump administration.

Washington has described Mr. Abbas as a potential spoiler. Palestinian officials have boycotted the Trump administration since its December announcement it was moving the U.S. embassy to the contested city of Jerusalem.

In a recent interview with a Palestinian newspaper, Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, criticized Mr. Abbas, saying: “There are a lot of sharp statements and condemnations, but no ideas or efforts with prospects of success.”

In response, Abbas spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh said the Palestinian leader “cannot be bypassed, neither regionally nor internationally.”

The territories of the West Bank, governed by the Palestinian Authority, and the Gaza Strip, run by Hamas, are divided. Ordinary Palestinians are frustrated with the failure of the government to deliver basic services amid high poverty and unemployment.

“Unfortunately, our experience with democracy was a big failure,” said Qassam Barghouti, who works in public relations. Palestinian leaders have failed to make “space for young people and for women to be well-represented in the decision-making circles in the country.”

Mr. Barghouti is the son of Marwan Barghouti, a politician viewed as a possible successor to Mr. Abbas who is now in prison in Israel after being convicted on murder charges in connection with a Palestinian uprising known as the Second Intifada.

Officials say time isn’t on their side and that they fear more radical leaders, backed by restless young people, could end up in charge.

About 70% of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are 29 and younger, according to the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics. Those who run the Palestinian Authority are in their 60s, 70s and 80s.

Under the 1993 Oslo Accords that set the terms for relations between Israel and the Palestinians, the Palestinian Authority was meant to be an interim government until a sovereign state could be established. Palestinian officials say they have been unable to hold elections while the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are divided.

A recent reconciliation effort has stalled, as Hamas, which controls Gaza, has refused to dissolve its armed wing. There are also financial disagreements.

Palestinians have directed fresh ire at Mr. Abbas because he has slashed government salaries in the Gaza Strip, a move also deeply unpopular in the West Bank.

The Palestinian Authority controlled the Gaza Strip until 2007, and had continued to pay its employees there even after Hamas took control. Mr. Abbas hoped the cuts would pressure Hamas in a stalled reconciliation process, but the hardship has deepened.

Last month, security forces broke up a demonstration in Ramallah over the cuts, and a protest several days earlier drew 2,000 people.

Fadi Quran, 30, one of the organizers, said activists limited the focus to Mr. Abbas’s Gaza policy rather than calling for his resignation, since many aren’t ready to cross that line.

“People don’t have a vision of what happens next,” he said.
