__label__politics Washington (CNN) Sen. John McCain has decided to stop treatment for the brain cancer he has been battling for over a year, his family said Friday in an announcement that precipitated a rare moment of bipartisan empathy in honor of the Vietnam war hero and Republican political veteran.

Colleagues of McCain, 81, had been bracing for the worst for months as the Arizona senator retreated from public life to fight the disease. But Friday's news left them shaken nonetheless. It effectively closes a tumultuous Washington career that included two unsuccessful presidential runs and saw McCain emerge as a singular political figure, an icon of the Senate and latterly as a vehement critic of President Donald Trump.

"Last summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: he had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict. With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment," the McCain family said in a statement.

The statement went on to say: "Our family is immensely grateful for the support and kindness of all his caregivers over the last year, and for the continuing outpouring of concern and affection from John's many friends and associates, and the many thousands of people who are keeping him in their prayers. God bless and thank you all."

Cindy McCain, the senator's wife, wrote in a tweet, "I love my husband with all of my heart. God bless everyone who has cared for my husband along this journey." The senator's daughter, Meghan McCain, said in a tweet, "My family is deeply appreciative of all the love and generosity you have shown us during this past year. Thank you for all your continued support and prayers. We could not have made it this far without you - you've given us strength to carry on."

__label__politics (CNN) As officials in Washington prepared to honor the late Sen. John McCain, President Donald Trump headed to Evansville, Indiana, to headline a campaign rally for GOP Senate nominee Mike Braun. If you thought Trump might honor McCain's passing or adjust his fiery campaign rhetoric in any way, you thought wrong! (Trump never mentioned McCain by name in the speech.)

I went through the transcript of Trump's speech and pulled out the most, um, memorable lines. They're below.

1. "You love our country. You're proud of our history. And you always respect our great American flag."

While this is a standard Trump line, it takes on a bit of a different meaning since the flag over the White House went back to full-staff on Monday morning -- even as the US Capitol Building had the flag still at half-staff to honor McCain. Later in the day , Trump issued an order for the flags at the White House to hang at half-staff until McCain's burial at the Naval Academy on Sunday.

2. "And now tomorrow you're going to read headlines, 'Trump had protesters all over the place.' One person. One person."

3. "But are they going to talk about the thousands and thousands of people inside of this arena and outside of the arena, where we put screens? No."

The Indianapolis Star reported that all of the arena's 11,000 seats were full -- and that people "spilled out onto the floor."

4. "These are just dishonest, terrible people. I'm telling you that. Terrible people."

5. "They do suppression polls. You know what a fake poll is. It's called a suppression. They make you think you can't win, so you go to see a movie."

This is not a thing. Or at least not a thing any credible, mainstream media outlet would get anywhere near. What Trump means is that sometimes polls don't come out well for him or his side. When that happens, he calls those "suppression polls" because they might have the effect of discouraging people to vote for a lost cause. That, of course, is not the aim of polls. The aim of polls is to provide a snapshot of where a race stands.

6. "But the word is they're firing the head of NBC. What a great thing to do. How smart. That's what the word. Who knows? With these people, you never know."

A classic in the Trump rhetorical catalog. I hear someone might get fired. But that could change. Who knows? By doing this, Trump injects the idea into the minds of his supporters and forces some level of media coverage -- even if it's very skeptical. He does all of that without a single shred of evidence that NBC News President Andrew Lack is getting fired

7. "But when I start screaming 'fake news,' you see those red lights go off for a little while. You know, excuse me, we have technical difficulties, OK, then they go back. "

So. The President of the United States is alleging, with no proof, that TV cameras are faking technical difficulties when he starts talking about "fake news." Which is weird, because I watched him say this line on TV last night.

8. "It's tough to have a network where you're calling them 'fake news' and they're supposed to be proud."

[narrator voice] It's not tough at all, actually.

9. "That just shows when you get good ratings, you can say anything."

He said the quiet part out loud! If you needed Trump's view on the media -- and on life more generally -- condensed into a single sentence, this would be the sentence I would write. If you listen closely enough to Trump, he always tells you exactly what he thinks, and who he is.

10. "We're so far ahead of schedule."

There's a schedule? Who knew!

11. "I gave Mike, a little while ago, something that I saw -- but he's seen it -- the Indianapolis Star did a story, and I guess it's a poll of some kind. Joe Donnelly rated least effective Democrat in Senate in a new study."

Two things: 1) Here's the study Trump is referencing and 2) It's amazing how Trump sees zero hypocrisy in calling the media "dishonest, terrible people" one moment and then citing a mainstream media story to make a point that is good for him.

12. "Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by left-wing haters, angry mobs, 'deep state' radicals, establishment cronies, and their fake news allies."

This is a pretty remarkable thing for a president -- even Trump -- to say. The opposition party is haters, angry mobs, people who make up the news, swamp-dwellers and embedded bureaucrats working to bring down his presidency. What's even scarier is that I think he may genuinely believe it.

13. " You can have the biggest story about Hillary Clinton -- I mean, look at what she's getting away with. But let's see if she gets away with it."

Trump never specifies what Clinton is "getting away with." Doesn't matter. The crowd erupts in an extended "Lock Her Up!" chant. What are we locking her up for? No one seems to know!

14. " All I can say is, our Justice Department and our FBI -- at the top of each, because inside, they have incredible people -- but our Justice Department and our FBI have to start doing their job right and doing it right and doing it now."

This is more "deep state" conspiracy stuff. Remember that the head of the Justice Department -- Jeff Sessions -- was a top Trump supporter during the campaign and was hand-picked by the President for this job.

15. "What's happening is a disgrace."

A Republican president offers his thoughts on his own Justice Department.

16. "I wanted to stay out. But at some point, if it doesn't straighten out properly -- I want them to do their job -- I will get involved, and I'll get in there, if I have to."

Trump, translated: The Justice Department better start pursuing my personal whims -- or else.

17. "Republicans stand for stopping illegal immigration, fixing bad, horrible, obsolete trade deals, unleashing American energy, cutting taxes, supporting our militaries and our great vets, our great, great vets."

Great vets like, say, John McCain?

18. "But of the nine, eight of them were crying. And I looked at the ninth, crying out of happiness, because they're back."

Trump relayed to the crowd that he ran into nine coal miners backstage in Evansville -- and they were all weeping out of happiness for what he has done for the coal-mining industry. The chances this story is actually true? 50-50.

19." I actually asked them, I said, did they do polling when Honest Abe Lincoln was around? You know what? Nobody's been able to give me that answer, but I'm assuming they did, OK? So we can say we're beating Honest Abe."

Donald Trump just said he is more popular right now with Republicans than Abe Lincoln was in his time. What a sense of history!

20. "These -- this is a group of gang members -- I can't say 'animals' anymore, because Nancy Pelosi got very angry when I called them animals. I called them animals. She went crazy. I can't do it."

Here's what Pelosi actually said : "When the President of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, 'these are not people, these are animals,' you have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity? In the dignity and worth of every person? 'These are not people, these are animals,' from the President of the United States."

21. "We're doing a great job. And we have really no laws to work with. We have really no laws to work with. The laws are horrible. Laws are the worst and dumbest in the history of the world."

A real quote from the President of the United States.

22. "I pick up. I said hello. He goes, 'Trump, this is Bobby Knight, and you got to run for president. Our country needs you.' And I said that's Bobby Knight. That's Bobby Knight. Right? That's Bobby Knight."

Knight, the famous/infamous longtime basketball coach at Indiana University, was a prominent Trump supporter.

23. "But I had two big stacks -- you'll see pictures of me in the office, you'll see these massive stacks."

Stacks on stacks.

24. "We were on center stage of every single debate, right? Every single debate. Center stage means we were never in second place."

The re-telling of his positioning on the stage in 2016 primary debates is so, so Trump. Being center stage means he was in first, the big winner, the one everyone wanted to look at and talk about. This is his life goal.

25. "We love winners. We love winners. Winners are winners."

[nods head knowingly]

26. "Did you say the fake news tried to fake out Tiger? They didn't do too well. Tiger's sharp."

Woods was asked at a tournament this week about his relationship with Trump. Here's what he said : "We've played golf together. We've had dinner together. I've known him pre-presidency and obviously during his presidency." Asked whether his friendship with Trump amounted to tacit support for the President's policies, Woods responded: "He's the President of the United States. You have to respect the office," he said. "No matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office."

27. "No, we love winners. We love winners. "

So, let me get this straight. Winning is good? And we like winners?

28. "And we're the talk of the world. I'll tell you, every foreign leader who comes to see me, almost, they walk in and they start off, Mr. President, congratulations on the incredible success you're having with your economy. Congratulations. Everything. Almost everyone."

It apparently doesn't occur to Trump that foreign leaders are taking this approach because he's demonstrated over and over again that he likes people who praise him. It probably should occur to him.

29. "See, you have to understand, I have a better education than they do from a much better school, but -- the elite. They're the elite. They're the elite. I went to better schools, I went to better everything. And by the way, by the way, are you ready for this? And I'm President, and they're not."

The key to understanding so much of what Trump says and does is this: He believes himself to have always been mocked by the so-called "elites." He has always felt like the guy on the outside looking in, the person the people he wanted to be ignored and and laughed at. Trump's life has been motivated by a singular desire to prove all of those people wrong. "I'm president and you're not," is the sort of thing you might expect to hear from someone in fifth grade. But that grade-school mentality is how Trump looks at the world.

30. "If Crooked Hillary came here, if she had 300 to 500 people -- first of all, she wouldn't be in this building. She'd be in a hotel conference room. It would be a conference room, right?"

The 2016 election ended 661 days ago.

31. "And I'm not saying -- I'm just saying. I'm not saying it's -- I'm just saying, something incredible is happening with our country to have this."

So, is he saying? Or not saying? I'm confused.

32. "And for the first time ever, really -- and we have a lot of great programs to help -- for the first time ever, employers are hiring prisoners."

This is not, um, the first time that employers are hiring ex-prisoners.

33. "And I have a friend who hired prisoners. I said, 'Whoa, that's great.' And he said, 'You wouldn't believe how great they are. They're better than my other people.'"

"Whoa, that's great." -- President Donald Trump

34. "It's such a beautiful name, clean power. Clean power, right?"

Uh, yes?

35. "When there's thousands of birds laying at the base of the windmill, what do we do? Isn't that amazing?"

Amazing is, I guess, a word for it?

36. "If your house is staring at a windmill, not good. When you hear that noise going 'round and 'round and 'round, and you're living with it, and then you go crazy after a couple of years, not good."

"How Windmills Make You Crazy," By Donald Trump

37. "Because we've put mechanisms in work -- lots of different -- I won't bore you with the complications -- it's actually -- we had middlemen that were so rich they were making a fortune on drugs, prescription drugs."

"You know, a lotta ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-you's. And, uh, lotta strands to keep in my head, man. Lotta strands in old Duder's head." -- Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski.

38. "Our veterans are the greatest. ... These are, really, our greatest people, as far as I'm concerned."

Like, say, John McCain?

39. "I guess I'm good at getting things passed, but it was great."

#Humblebrag

40. "It's called Space Force. So important. So important."

41. "We are standing up for the heroes who protect America."

Like, say, John McCain?

42 ."We're going to win so much that you're going to be begging me, 'Please, please, Mr. President, the people of Indiana cannot continue to win like this. We're not used to this. This is terrible!'"

"Terrible Winning" would be a good band name.

43. "I don't give a damn what they want. We're going to keep on winning."

"Too much winning can be wonderful." -- Mae West/Donald Trump

__label__politics (CNN) Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner is now officially part of the trove of evidence in Paul Manafort's criminal trial, as part of an email exchange with the former campaign chairman about potential senior administration jobs.

Manafort sent Kushner a recommendation to appoint Federal Savings Bank chair Stephen Calk as secretary of the Army in a November 30, 2016, email released Monday by the Justice Department.

At the same time, Manafort had received the first part of what would be $16 million in loans from Calk's bank, according to testimony Monday from James Brennan, the bank's vice president

Manafort also suggested two other possible Trump appointees, Pat Sink and Vernon Parker, according to the email released Monday.

"The 3 indivituals (sic) are people who I believe advance DT agenda. They will be totally reliable and responsive to the Trump White House," Manafort wrote to Kushner.

Archaeologists believe they have unearthed one of Egypt's oldest-known settlements in the Nile Delta, dating back some 7,000 years to the Neolithic era.

The country's ministry of antiquities announced the discovery of a village in the Tell el-Samara area of the Dakahlia governorate, north of Cairo, in a statement posted to Facebook on Sunday.

A joint team of Egyptian and French archaeologists say they located several storage silos where organic matter -- such as animal bones and plant remains -- were recovered in addition to fragments of pottery and stone tools.

These findings allowed the expedition to date the village to around 5,000 BC, which would mean it was established approximately 2,500 years before work began on the Great Pyramid of Giza , one of Egypt's oldest and most famous structures.

Expedition leader Frederik Geo said in the ministry statement that excavations at the site had been ongoing since 2015 and the discovery would allow experts to learn more about the communities that "were living in the Delta for thousands of years before the First Dynasty (the period of unifying the North and the South by King Mina and the beginning of Egyptian History)."

Egypt's new one-billion dollar museum

Archaeologists will continue to excavate the village site next season and hope analysis of the organic material found will shed light on the origins of farming and agriculture in Egypt.

Earlier this year, Egyptian archaeologists made headlines around the globe when they unearthed a huge, undisturbed granite sarcophagus , thought by some to be the largest ever found in Alexandria.

Egypt has faced years of instability since the 2011 Arab Spring and tourism, which once contributed more than 11% of the country's GDP, has struggled in the years since.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Fresh off his victory in the Florida Republican gubernatorial primary on Tuesday night, Rep. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday morning that voters would "monkey this up" if they elected his African-American opponent, Andrew Gillum to be governor because of his "socialist agenda."

Calling him "an articulate spokesman" for the far left, DeSantis said during an interview on Fox News when asked about his opponent Gillum, "The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state."

Gillum, who is African American, would become the state's first black governor if he were to win in November.

Democrats in Florida were quick to respond to the comments made by DeSantis.

"It's disgusting that Ron DeSantis is launching his general election campaign with racist dog whistles," Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo said in a statement. The Gillum campaign pointed to this statement when asked for response.

__label__politics (CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a series of new planks Tuesday in her wider plan to stem corporate influence on government and root out corruption in Washington.

Introduced as a potential 2020 presidential primary contender, the Massachusetts Democrat took aim at President Donald Trump, casting him as the product of a rotten system rather than an outlier or fluke and saying his administration fit a decades-old pattern of self-dealing in Washington.

Warren's plan, which would impose a lifetime ban on appointed officials from taking lobbying jobs, is dead on arrival in a Republican-controlled Congress. But it is likely to influence the talking points of other Democrats and, should she run for higher office in 2020, be a staple of her campaign pitch.

In a speech at the National Press Club, Warren called for Congress to "end lobbying as we know it" and not allow "the rich and powerful buy their way into congressional offices."

"Our national crisis of faith in government boils down to this simple fact: People don't trust their government to do the right thing because they think government works for the rich, the powerful and the well-connected and not for the American people," Warren said. "And here's the kicker: They're right."

__label__politics (CNN) Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr told CNN Tuesday he believed there were "sound reasons" for judges to approve the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page, in yet another break between the Republican leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees.

"I don't think I ever expressed that I thought the FISA application came up short," Burr said when asked about House Republican memo alleging FBI and Justice Department abuses of the FISA process. "There (were) sound reasons as to why judges issued the FISA."

Burr's comments once again put him at odds with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, who spearheaded the memo on FISA abuses.

Burr and Nunes have been on opposite sides of a number of key issues related to the Justice Department and intelligence community's handling of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

While Nunes' committee disputed the "tradecraft" behind the US intelligence community's January 2017 assessment that found Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to help Donald Trump win, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a report earlier this month that agreed with the intelligence community's conclusions and took no issue with its tradecraft.

__label__politics (CNN) One of the Department of Justice attorneys who withdrew from an ongoing case over the Affordable Care Act just before the government said it would no longer defend the law has resigned.

Joel McElvain is one of three career Justice Department attorneys who withdrew from the lawsuit brought by Texas and a coalition of other Republican-led states challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. He has tendered his resignation and his last day will be July 6, according to a department spokesperson.

The two other employees who withdrew from the case -- Rebecca Kopplin and Eric Beckenhauer -- have had no change in their employment status, the spokesperson said.

The Washington Post was the first to report McElvain's resignation, which is said to come after "internal frustration generated by the decision, according to people familiar with the matter."

McElvain did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

__label__politics (CNN) John McCain has drawn tributes from presidents and prime ministers, senators and secretaries of state in the emotion-laden days since his death.

But it took a daughter to capture the measure of the man -- to remember him as the "fierce conscience of the nation's best self" and to thrust the rhetorical dagger that was the culmination of a uniquely political week of mourning.

"We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness. The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly," the senator's daughter Meghan McCain said in a stunning eulogy laced with grief, anger, pride and love.

"The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great," she said, before being interrupted by an outburst of spontaneous applause at McCain's memorial service at Washington's National Cathedral on Saturday.

It was the most cutting moment of a funeral that operated on two levels. First, it was a farewell to a warrior, a senator, a friend and a father. But the service was also a prolonged allegory that served to highlight McCain's character, and by comparison, to condemn the politics of personality of Donald Trump.

The funeral marked the largest gathering of the bipartisan political establishment since the President's stark inaugural address in January 2017. Though he was unwelcome and was not mentioned by name, the event stood as an indictment of Trump's rule and the ideals his opponents believe he has crushed.

McCain's death, as the Arizona senator planned, has evolved into an extraordinary political moment that has elevated a national debate over the consequences of the Trump presidency, which critics see as a challenge to constitutional norms and the values on which the United States was founded.

Eulogizers, citing McCain's honor, courage, patriotic service, obstinacy, humor, reverence for freedom and contempt for bullies, presented the Arizona Republican as the personification of America itself. His loss, and the code by which he lived became a metaphor for something now gone from the nation's civic arena.

"So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty, trafficking in bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage," former President Barack Obama said in a remembrance of a man whom he beat to the presidency in 2008, and who he wryly remembered hounded him for his performance almost every day he was in office.

"It's a politics that pretends to be brave and tough, but in fact is born of fear. John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that," Obama said in a clear denunciation of Trump.

Obama's predecessor George W. Bush, another vanquisher of McCain's presidential ambitions who was asked to eulogize him , said the senator, who lay in a casket covered in the American flag, lived by a set of "public virtues that brought strength and purpose to his life and to his country."

"Perhaps above all, John detested the abuse of power. He could not abide bigots and swaggering despots," Bush said, in another apparent reference to Trump's conduct and affinity for strongmen like Russian President Vladimir Putin.

By asking the two men who thwarted his White House dreams to lead mourners, McCain made a powerful point about lost decency in Washington, the imperative in a democratic system for political enemies to bury their differences, and the importance of national unity.

Obama, who revealed that McCain would come to talk to him privately in the Oval Office -- a fact neither man advertised -- put it this way: "We never doubted the other man's sincerity or the other man's patriotism. Or that when all was said and done, we were on the same team."

One glaring absence

It is a mark of the tortured political times, and the sheer unorthodoxy of the Trump presidency, that the current commander-in-chief was not called upon to lead America in mourning one of its most iconic sons and statesmen.

But a feud that boiled even after McCain's death a week ago of brain cancer prevented that, along with McCain's belief that the behavior and views of the current President represent an affront to American ideals -- a point he deliberately put at the center of his funeral rites.

Trump spent the morning at the White House, attacking a US ally -- Canada -- hitting out at Obama, whose name he misspelled in a Twitter post, and assailing the FBI and the Justice Department over the Russia investigation before heading to his golf club in Virginia.

During his campaign, the President said McCain was not a war hero because he was captured in Vietnam and he declined to release a statement marking his death.

It was that kind of behavior that Meghan McCain decried as she spoke from her heart about her father and hero.

"He was a great man. ... he was a great fire who burned bright," she said.

"A few have resented that fire for that light it cast upon them, for the truth it revealed about their character, but my father never cared what they thought," the senator's daughter said in staggeringly direct and unrestrained address that would have made her father glow with pride.

She remembered how her father bore his suffering from injuries received as a Vietnam prisoner of war with the "stoic silence that was once the mark of an American man," in another apparent jab at the President.

Fighting against her grief, and sobbing, McCain's daughter said she had asked her ailing father how she should approach his eulogy before a vast national audience.

"'Show them how tough you are,'" she said, quoting the six-term senator and formal naval aviator.

Meghan McCain said her father revered an America that was "generous, welcoming and bold. She is resourceful and confident and secure. America does not boast, because she has no need to," she said.

When she appropriated Trump's slogan, "Make America Great Again," there was silence for a few seconds, then quietly at first, but building in a wave, came a round of applause.

In the third row, behind three ex-presidents, their wives and their Secret Service details, sat Trump's chief of staff John Kelly. Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were also in the congregation.

Across the aisle from the past presidents sat McCain's wife, Cindy, who lost her composure only once -- when opera singer Renee Fleming sang "Danny Boy," an elegy of loss and love that consoled the senator in the final days of his life. A tear dropped from her right eye and she rested her head on the shoulder of her son Jack, who wore a white dress Navy uniform.

The funeral is unlikely to change political realities on its own. Trump's supporters may even see validation in the fact that the President is so decried by the political establishment he won power promising to eviscerate. But it seems destined to become a signature moment in the national assessment of Trump's presidency that will shape the mid-term elections in November and will culminate in the 2020 White House race.

One of McCain's closest political friends, former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, remarked that his old colleague's passing had caused Americans to reconsider the country's founding values of freedom, human rights, opportunity, democracy and equal justice.

"Remarkably, his death seems to have reminded the American people that these values are what makes us a great nation, not the tribal partisanship and personal attack politics that have recently characterized our life," Lieberman said.

"This week's celebration of the life and values of patriotism of this hero, I think have taken our country above all that."

"It's the last great gift that John McCain gave America."
__label__politics (CNN) Before he was President, Donald Trump deceived a Forbes reporter about his personal wealth in the 1980s in order to make it onto the magazine's Forbes 400 list, according to a new allegation by the reporter.

What the reporter, Jonathan Greenberg, detailed on CNN's "New Day" Friday bears similarities to other tales of Trump passing himself off as (fake) Trump Organization executive, John Barron, and bragging about his exploits on the topics of money and women.

Greenberg said Trump, as Barron, made a roughly $5 million fortune look like $100 million to get on the list.

The current Forbes list puts Trump at No. 248 on the 400 list, No. 766 on its billionaires list, and pegs his worth at $3.1 billion , a significant drop from the $3.7 billion it reported in 2016.

The specific veracity of Greenberg's allegations, though backed up by a recently discovered audio recording, will have to be sussed out, but it is notably still true that we don't know as much as you would think about the President's finances.
__label__politics (CNN) A speechwriter for President Donald Trump who attended a conference frequented by white nationalists has left the White House.

CNN's KFile reached out to the White House last week about Darren Beattie, a policy aide and speechwriter , who was listed as speaking at the 2016 H.L. Mencken Club Conference.

The Mencken Club, which is named for the early 20th century journalist and satirist whose posthumously published diaries revealed racist views, is a small annual conference started in 2008 and regularly attended by well-known white nationalists such as Richard Spencer . The schedule for the 2016 conference listed panels and speeches by white nationalist Peter Brimelow and two writers, John Derbyshire and Robert Weissberg , who were both fired in 2012 from the conservative magazine National Review for espousing racist views.

The White House, which asked CNN to hold off on the story for several days last week declined to say when Beattie left the White House. Beattie's email address at the White House, which worked until late Friday evening, was no longer active by Saturday.

"Mr. Beattie no longer works at the White House," White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told CNN on Friday night. "We don't comment on personnel matters."

Beattie confirmed to CNN he spoke to the 2016 conference, saying his speech was not objectionable. Two days after publication of this story, Beattie provided CNN with what he said was the full text of his speech at the conference.

"In 2016 I attended the Mencken conference in question and delivered a stand-alone, academic talk titled 'The Intelligentsia and the Right.' I said nothing objectionable and stand by my remarks completely," he told CNN's KFile in an email on Saturday. "It was the honor of my life to serve in the Trump Administration. I love President Trump, who is a fearless American hero, and continue to support him one hundred percent. I have no further comment."

Beattie gained prominence in 2016 when as a visiting instructor in Duke University's political science department he signed on to a letter of academic scholars supporting Trump. He correctly predicted Trump would win the 2016 presidential election.

Update: This story has been updated with additional response from Darren Beattie.
__label__world Genoa, Italy (CNN) The sound of jackhammers reverberated through the night in this northern Italian city, where crews searched for survivors of a highway bridge collapse that left about two dozen people dead, officials said.

A major section of the bridge partially collapsed on Tuesday, sending vehicles hurtling toward the earth. Abandoned vehicles remain on the span, with one truck close to the edge. Some chunks of concrete are the height of a three-story building.

The search-and-rescue mission is expected to last for days, Emanuele Gissi, an engineer with the country's fire service, told state broadcaster RAI News 24. Gissi said several people remain missing.

Teams with rescue dogs are aiding the effort.

Angelo Borrelli, head of the Italian Civil Protection Agency, said about 30 vehicles and several heavy-duty trucks were on the affected section of the Morandi Bridge, which lies to the west of the port city of Genoa, when it gave way.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said 22 people are dead and another 16 people were injured, nine of them in serious condition. Separately, the office of the governor of the Liguria region said 26 people have died. Genoa officials declared two days of mourning.

According to police, violent storms were partly to blame for the disaster. Maintenance work also was underway at the time to consolidate parts of the bridge, according to motorway operator Autostrade. A bridge crane had been installed to allow the work to be carried out, the operator said in a statement

"The works and the status of the viaduct were subject to constant observation and supervision," the statement said. "The causes for the collapse will be the object of an in-depth analysis as soon as it will be possible to safely access the site."

Conte said authorities were working on the theory the collapse was due to a "structural failure."

The number of casualties is expected to grow as the rubble is removed, Borrelli said, but it is unlikely that anyone was underneath the bridge at the time of the collapse, he added.

Some 440 people have had to abandon their homes following the collapse of the bridge, the mayor of Genoa's office said in a statement. Eleven buildings had to be evacuated and the number of people and buildings evacuated could rise as risk assessments are ongoing.

'It was frightening'

The incident at the bridge, a concrete structure opened in 1968, occurred about noon (6 a.m. ET) Tuesday, Italian state police said.

The A10, which runs across the bridge, is a major highway for residents and tourists in Genoa, connecting the city with the nearby airport, and a key route along the Mediterranean, linking the Italian coast with French coastal cities to the west.

The disaster occurred during peak tourist season -- when many French tourists would have been using the highway -- and one day before a national public holiday when many Italians travel to coastal areas.

Davide Di Giorgio was filming the heavy rain from the window of his office in Genoa when he saw part of the bridge crash to the ground.

"As soon as I turned the camera on to record the rain, we heard a loud noise and the bridge collapsed," Di Giorgio said. "It took me three seconds to realize what happened."

"My colleagues and I were shaking. It was frightening," he added.

Eyewitness Davide Ricci told local newspaper Il Secolo XIX that he thought he saw lightning hit the bridge shortly before it crumbled. Flashes of lightning can also be seen in the footage shot by Di Giorgio.

"The debris from the collapsed (bridge) fell 20 meters from my car," Ricci said, adding that he was driving south along the nearby river road at the time. "The central pylon crumbled, then the rest came down."

Emergency services, including the fire department, police, ambulances and mountain rescue teams including sniffer dogs, soon arrived at the site. Several hours later, around 200 firefighters were still working at the scene, according to the Italian fire service

Luca Cari, spokesman for the fire service, told Italian news agency Rai that rescuers were searching for people underneath the rubble as if it were an earthquake.

Canine search-and-rescue units were deployed by the Italian Red Cross to look for victims beneath the debris, while other Red Cross teams were sent out in police boats to search for people potentially stranded in the estuary of the Polcevera River.

Giorgio Larosa posted a video on Instagram showing rescuers working in heavy rain to free people from crushed vehicles in a grassy area below the viaduct.

Later in the day, Giorgio Mascione posted a video on Twitter showing the large gap between the two remaining sections of the viaduct, and the piles of rubble beneath.

Questions raised about bridge

It is unclear why a section of the bridge collapsed. Also known as the Polcevera Viaduct, the Morandi Bridge was designed by Italian civil engineer Riccardo Morandi and completed in 1968. The cable-stayed bridge had a total length of 1.1 kilometers and is 100 meters tall at its highest point.

The collapse came after 15 to 20 minutes of torrential rain, thunder and lightning. An automated report from the weather station at the nearby Genoa Cristoforo Colombo Airport around the time of the incident recorded thunderstorms with winds gusting to 57 kph (35 mph).

Some local residents are also questioning whether the bridge was adequately maintained.

"It is too early to say what caused the tragic collapse, but as this reinforced and prestressed concrete bridge has been there for 50 years it is possible that corrosion of tendons or reinforcement may be a contributory factor," said Ian Firth, former president of the UK-based Institution of Structural Engineers, and a structural engineer specializing in bridges.

He added that there were "no obvious signs" as to what triggered the collapse at this time and that the storm and ongoing work on the bridge may or may not be relevant factors.

Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci said the bridge collapse was "not absolutely unexpected" but that he didn't know the exact reason. When asked if he knew what had caused the bridge to collapse or if he knew if the bridge was undergoing repair work, Bucci said he wasn't sure.

"It's not my job to [know] that," he said. "My job is to think about the future and work for the future of the city."

"My role as the mayor is to make sure we have the correct infrastructure for the city and make sure that from the government we get the right amount of money in order to be able to set up the new infrastructure as soon as possible," Bucci also said.

Demitrios Cotsovos, associate professor at the Institute of Infrastructure and Environment at Heriot-Watt University in Scotland, also urged caution before drawing any conclusions.

Engineers should be looking at the impacts of aging on the structural integrity of bridges such as this as well as "the potential impact of the environment and extreme weather conditions."

"Potentially, there are lessons to be learned from such an event," Cotsovos said.

__label__politics (CNN) Donald Trump on Saturday sought to move past a lawsuit from adult film star Stormy Daniels that has created legal headaches for the President for much of this year, stating in a court filing that he would not seek to enforce the infamous 2016 settlement agreement between Daniels and Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen.

The so-called hush agreement, forged between Daniels and Cohen on behalf of his shell company Essential Consultants in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election, included a $130,000 payment to the actress in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump. Earlier this year, Daniels sued Trump, saying the secret agreement should be void since Trump himself never signed it. Trump on Saturday made clear that Daniels was right -- he was never party to the deal.

Trump's attorney, Charles Harder, said in Saturday's court filing that Trump would not contest Daniels' "assertion that the Settlement Agreement was never formed, or in the alternative, should be rescinded."

Harder ended his letter by calling for Daniels to "immediately dismiss" Trump from her lawsuit, and he requested a meeting with her attorney Michael Avenatti if she would not agree to dismiss Trump voluntarily.

Trump's move followed a separate filing from Cohen on Friday. In it, Cohen agreed to tear up the original 2016 agreement with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. Trump has denied the alleged affair.

__label__politics (CNN) Back before he controlled the GOP, before his endorsement seemed capable of swinging a primary, before he was President of the United States and before he'd won most Republican primaries in 2016, Donald Trump had very few friends in Congress.

Just a handful of Republican lawmakers endorsed his campaign early on.

Interestingly, while Trump's power in the party has only grown, those lawmakers who first stuck their necks out for him have not fared well in the Trump era.

The Washington Post was tracking this back in March of 2016, when Trump had the GOP primary well in hand but only token support on Capitol Hill. They called the first five lawmakers to endorse him Congress' Trump caucus

You'd be hard-pressed to find many Republicans who wouldn't endorse him now. Those who opposed him in 2016 have paid a price. ( Ahem, Jeff Flake ).

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos signaled on Friday that she does not plan to take action over the purchase of guns for schools using federal funds.

In a letter to Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, DeVos wrote, "Let me be clear: I have no intention of taking any action concerning the purchase of firearms or firearms training for school staff under the ESEA," a reference to federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act funds.

The letter, which was posted to a Twitter account for the Education Department's press secretary, is dated Aug. 31.

DeVos wrote that there is " 'substantial flexibility' in how school districts use these funds" and that "Congress did not authorize me or the Department to make those decisions. As I have stated publicly on numerous occasions since I was nominated for this position, I will not legislate via fiat from the Department."

Earlier this month, the Trump administration pushed back on a New York Times report that DeVos was looking into a plan that would allow states to use federal funding to buy firearms for teachers.

__label__world (CNN) Voters in Sweden will cast their ballots Sunday in a potentially game-changing election that could see the Sweden Democrats -- a once obscure far-right party with neo-Nazi roots -- become the second-biggest party in the perennially left-leaning country.

The political landscape in Sweden has changed dramatically since the last election in 2014. Sweden's open-arms approach to refugees in 2015 catapulted the populist, anti-immigrant SD party to political prominence, forcing many of the country's liberal and moderate parties to adopt more conservative policies around immigration.

While the immigration debate has dominated the headlines, there are a host of other critical issues on voters' minds, including healthcare, education and the environment.

Here's a look at how Sweden compares on these issues with the rest of Europe -- and what the country's largest political parties are pledging to do to tackle them.

These include the ruling Social Democrats, a historically working-class and center-left party; the Moderates, a traditionally center-right party; and the Sweden Democrats, the hard-right party that also claims to want to uphold the country's generous social benefits.

Healthcare

Healthcare is the top issue for 38% of Swedish voters , according to recent polls, and has been one of the central focuses of the campaign.

Swedish healthcare performs well compared to other European Union countries -- Swedish life expectancy is among the highest in the EU -- and is the linchpin of one of the world's most successful welfare states.

Few Swedes question the quality of the care they receive. But many others lament the long waits they sometimes endure to access that care.

"Ordinary people think the accessibility to healthcare is really bad," said Henrik Oscarsson, professor of political science and electoral studies at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. "Of course, once you get help it's world-class, but it takes time for people [to] get into the system."

The poor working conditions of nurses and other staff working in elderly care has been another long-standing issue. Since 2005, the number of patients per staff member has continued to increase, Expressen reported , putting extreme pressure on already taxed workers.

As staff have become more dissatisfied, the quality of care offered has also fallen. Around 50% of staff are considering quitting their jobs, Expressen reported

All the major parties, including the Social Democrats, the Sweden Democrats, and the Moderates -- projected in a recent poll to win 25%, 17.2% and 17% of the vote , respectively -- have included measures to cut waiting times as part of their campaign initiatives.

The Social Democrats also intend to train and hire 14,000 new healthcare workers to address the current gap in personnel that is currently delaying access to treatment.

The Sweden Democrats, on the other hand, have taken a hard line on access to the country's generous healthcare system , promising to stop providing free care to undocumented immigrants and create new rules around what kind of care non-residents can get.

Immigration

In 2015, Sweden took in 162,450 asylum seekers, the second-largest number of migrants per capita of any EU nation, and a huge number for a country with a population under 10 million people. (Only Hungary took in more migrants per capita).

The number of asylum seekers has dropped since then to 26,325 in 2017

Nonetheless, the large initial wave of refugees that came to Sweden in 2014-15 -- combined with what Oscarsson described as the "cultural distance" between migrants and native-born Swedes -- has led to tensions.

The Sweden Democrats have capitalized on those tensions and risen in the polls, from 2.9% in the 2006 election to around 17% in recent polling.

Recent reporting on gangs and gang violence has helped to keep the immigration issue in the spotlight, though homicide data has remained relatively stable over time.

The Social Democrats are urging more integration programs in marginalized communities to be established as well as increasing financial support for municipalities to encourage better educational attainment for people living in those areas. The Social Democrats also say that they will give the police more resources for social work in marginalized areas.

The Moderates have pledged to give more funds to the police , and are pushing for Swedish migration policy to fall in line with laws in other EU countries, such as Norway, Denmark and Germany. This would mean that migrants won't be able to stay unless they can prove that they can support themselves , enabling them to get a permanent residence permit. They are also looking at ways of more quickly incorporating migrants into the workforce, such as promoting "simple jobs," a reference to work that can be obtained with only an elementary education.

The Sweden Democrats plan on providing police with more tools to seek out undocumented immigrants, as well as changing the law so that residence permits for foreigners can be revoked under certain circumstances.

"If you are ready to adapt, you are welcome to live here in Sweden," said Jimmie Åkesson, leader of the Sweden Democrats. "But if you do not want to adjust, you can live elsewhere."

Education

More than 47% of Swedes between 25 and 34 had some form of tertiary education in 2016 -- the year with the latest available data -- ranking the country among Europe's top performers.

Some of the country's Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores -- an OECD measure of countries' educational systems -- have fallen over the past decade, worrying many Swedes, according to Bo Rothstein of the Quality of Government Institute at the University of Gothenburg.

Despite investing substantially in education -- Sweden spent 6.6% of its GDP on education in 2016, the second most in the EU, behind only Denmark -- the country's performance has fallen below many voters' expectations. Among EU countries, Sweden ranked 14th in science, 11th in math, and 8th in reading in the latest PISA assessment.

The Sweden Democrats have vowed to increase teacher wages and encourage more vocational training for students.

Environment

Sweden is a European leader on environmental sustainability, with the highest share of renewable energy sources in the EU at 53.9%.

Concern over the environment has been growing in recent weeks in the lead-up to the election, and many voters are looking for politicians that offer strong environmental policies, CNN affiliate Expressen reported Wednesday.

The Social Democrats have emphasized the importance of increasing access to public transport , while at the same time investing in more green technology and better recycling

The Moderates have proposed various business incentives for companies to encourage them to reduce their emissions, while the Sweden Democrats want to increase investment in innovative environmental technology as well as concentrate more funding efforts on nuclear energy.

Economy

On a nation-by-nation level, unemployment ranks as a top issue for voters across the EU, according to the Eurobarometer

While the jobless rate is typically a top issue for Swedes, it is lower down the list of priorities in the current election.

And although the economy looks set to slow slightly in 2019, Sweden's GDP is still estimated to grow by 2.2%

"Everyone predicted that when we took in this massive influx of migrants, the economy would collapse," Oscarsson said. "It didn't."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump sought to buy all the dirt on him collected by the tabloid National Enquirer and its parent company American Media Inc., according to a new report.

Trump and his former personal attorney Michael Cohen devised a plan to purchase potentially damaging stories about Trump from AMI, The New York Times reported Thursday, citing several of Trump's associates.

The plan was never finalized, according to the Times. Lawyers for Trump and Cohen declined to comment to the newspaper, as did AMI.

The information gathered on Trump dating back to the 1980s includes older stories and notes about Trump's marital woes, lawsuits and tips about alleged affairs, among other things, according to the Times.

Last week, Jerry George, the former Los Angeles Bureau Chief for the National Enquirer, told CNN's Erica Hill on "Erin Burnett OutFront" that American Media head David Pecker kept a safe in which he held "particularly sensitive story files," including source agreements and contracts. The Associated Press first reported on the safe.

__label__politics (CNN) The US ambassador to Estonia is resigning in frustration with President Donald Trump's comments about, and treatment of, European allies.

James D. Melville Jr.'s resignation, first reported by Foreign Policy magazine, makes him the third ambassador in the last year to leave the State Department early. He is among many senior State Department officials who have headed for the exits or been pushed toward them since Trump assumed office.

In a statement, a State Department spokesperson confirmed Melville's departure.

"Earlier today, the United States' Ambassador to Estonia, Jim Melville, announced his intent to retire from the Foreign Service effective July 29 after 33 years of public service," the statement read in its entirety.

Melville's resignation comes at a time of acutely heightened tension in an alliance that, before Trump's election, had been one of the most solid, reliable and interconnected US relationships.

But Trump's attacks on NATO members, his trade tariffs against EU nations, his rejection of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement and his attacks on leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel have cast a pall over US ties to Europe.

Many European officials are wary about Trump's mid-July visit to the NATO summit in Belgium. Those officials there fear that Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin after NATO will look like the friendlier encounter in comparison.

"The transatlantic relationship, which all around the table we consider a given, is not a given," a European diplomat told CNN. "We now have a major crisis."

'It's time to go'

Foreign Policy quoted from a private post on Melville's Facebook page in which the seasoned diplomat referred to the President's comments about Europe in explaining his decision to retire early.

"A Foreign Service Officer's DNA is programmed to support policy and we're schooled right from the start, that if there ever comes a point where one can no longer do so, particularly if one is in a position of leadership, the honorable course is to resign," the magazine quotes Melville's post as saying. "Having served under six presidents and 11 secretaries of state, I never really thought it would reach that point for me."

"For the President to say the EU was 'set up to take advantage of the United States, to attack our piggy bank,' or that 'NATO is as bad as NAFTA' is not only factually wrong, but proves to me that it's time to go," Melville said in the post.

The announcement of Melville's departure was followed by that of Susan Thornton, Trump's choice to be the nominee to be assistant secretary for East Asian affairs, later on Friday.

Two State Department officials said Thornton notified staff in an email today that she is retiring in July.

The officials said Thornton, a well-respected career diplomat who has been doing the job in an acting capacity since Trump took office, was notified she will in fact not be the nominee and she decided to retire.

Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson pushed very hard for Thornton's nomination amid intense pushback from conservatives on Capitol Hill and hardliners in the administration.

Secretary of State Pompeo tipped his hand on Thornton about a month ago during testimony on Capitol Hill, in which he said he would be making announcements on personnel, including a top diplomat for East Asia, signaling Thornton was no longer going to be considered for the post.

State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said the administration was grateful for Thornton's two-and-a-half decades of service.

"We particularly appreciate her dedication to Department and interagency colleagues, her extraordinary leadership, especially as Acting Assistant Secretary over the past year and a half, and the personal example she set as an embodiment of the best qualities of a Senior Foreign Service Officer," Nauert said in a statement. She added that Pompeo is moving forward with efforts to nominate someone for the key position.

The duo is only the latest foreign service officer to leave in a department where the senior ranks have been deeply depleted and even rising stars have resigned rather than serve the President.

In November, an award-winning US diplomat based in Nairobi wrote then Tillerson a blistering letter saying that the Trump administration had diminished the influence of State Department with its preference for military solutions.

Elizabeth Shackelford wrote that "despite the stinging disrespect this Administration has shown our profession," the State Department's diplomats "continue the struggle to keep our foreign policy on the positive trajectory necessary to avert global disaster in increasingly dangerous times."

'Traditional values ... betrayed'

In her resignation letter, Shackelford told Tillerson that she "would humbly request that you follow me out the door."

In January, then-US Ambassador to Panama John Feeley resigned over differences with the Trump administration, saying in his resignation letter that "as a junior foreign service officer, I signed an oath to serve faithfully the President and his administration in an apolitical fashion, even when I might not agree with certain policies."

"My instructors made clear that if I believed I could not do that, I would be honor bound to resign. That time has come," wrote Feeley.

Once he had left office, Feeley was less circumspect in a scathing oped in the Washington Post, saying that he had "resigned because the traditional core values of the United States, as manifested in the President's National Security Strategy and his foreign policies, have been warped and betrayed."

In March, another career diplomat, then-US Ambassador to Mexico Roberta Jacobson, announced her decision to step down amid increased tensions between the US and Mexico that's due in large part to Trump's incendiary rhetoric about the country, its citizens and its trade relationship with the US.

A few days after her announcement, the White House delivered the equivalent of a slap, excluding Jacobson -- who served as ambassador until May -- from a meeting in Mexico City between Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner and President Enrique Pena Nieto.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Trump administration was only able to reunite fewer than half of the eligible separated migrant families in its care by a court-ordered deadline Tuesday -- as the fates of thousands more remain in limbo.

A federal judge on Tuesday was nevertheless mostly satisfied with the government's efforts to meet his deadline, turning his attention next to the 2,000 to 3,000 families that will need to be reunited later in the month.

As of late Tuesday afternoon, four children of 102 identified for the deadline had already been reunified with their parents, and another 34 were expected to be reunited by the end of the day, according to the administration. That was fewer than the 54 children the federal government had previously said would be reunited by the deadline.

The children who are addressed under the Tuesday deadline are all under age 5 and have been held by the government for weeks or months after being separated from their parents at the border.

Just under half of those eligible will be reunited on time, and they're just a fraction of the thousands of young immigrants still in custody apart from their parents, many of whom are detained and separated from family as a byproduct of the Trump administration's "zero-tolerance" policy.

Based on information provided in court filings, US District Judge Dana Sabraw said in a court status hearing Tuesday he believes officials should be able to reunite 63 of the kids under age 5 with their parents by the deadline or "within the immediate proximity of today."

The remaining kids would take longer, he acknowledged. Some of their parents were ultimately not eligible for reunification, for reasons which include having a criminal history or not being biologically related to the children. Other parents had already been deported or released and have not yet been located.

But, he said, "these are firm deadlines, not aspirational goals."

Beyond the 38 who were to be reunited by Tuesday, another 16 children were to be reunited "soon thereafter," the filing said, as soon as they are confirmed as eligible, and another eight were flagged for follow-up regarding the safety and suitability of the parent. One more child's parent had an unresolved issue with the background check.

The plan for Tuesday's reunions is for the children to be released to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which runs the adult detention centers where their parents are being held. Once the children are handed over to their custody, ICE will release the families together with ankle monitors for the parents, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official told reporters on a conference call. This plan bypasses the lengthy "sponsor" process that is required to release an unaccompanied immigrant child from Health and Human Services custody.

Twelve more kids have parents who cannot be located yet, either because they had already been deported or were released into the country already.

There are 27 children that the government has determined are not eligible for reunification yet, either because the adult is ineligible due to criminal history or not actually being the parent, or because the parents present a danger to the child or have a contagious disease. A handful are also still in criminal custody.

The judge instructed the government attorneys and American Civil Liberties Union attorneys representing the immigrants in the case to discuss the remaining cases to make sure they agree. Any disputed situations -- including if the ACLU does not believe a criminal history is accurate, for example -- are to be referred to the judge in a status update filing due Thursday.

Also due Thursday: information on how many thousands more children aged 5 and older remain to be reunified by his next deadline, July 26.

Sabraw set another hearing for Friday.

Government's 'obligation'

Tuesday's hearing was also forward-looking, as Sabraw largely sided with the ACLU on how to process families moving forward.

The judge repeatedly noted that it was the government's obligation to reunite the families it had separated, and thus the full procedures it would use for children in its care who arrived to the US alone shouldn't apply.

"The idea of an application process doesn't fit in this context. The parent has a right to be reunified and it's the government's obligation to make it so," he said.

Parents, Sabraw said, shouldn't have to prove they're good sponsors for their own children.

The government and ACLU had disagreed over several procedural steps for reuniting parents. Siding with the ACLU in large part, Sabraw said the government should only DNA test families when necessary -- either because of time constraints or a lack of a paper trail.

He also said procedures like requiring parents to file a "sponsor care plan" should not be required before parents get their kids back.

"The parents are not applying. They don't have to prove that they're going to be a good sponsor," Sabraw said. "What the government has to look to is whether the parent is unfit or a danger."

He also noted that already-deported parents may be a "big issue," asking attorneys for both sides to address the issue of how to handle those reunions in their filing later this week.

"This is going to be a big issue it appears," Sabraw said, "because if we have 12 out of 101 or 102, when we look at the next 2,800, 2,900 individuals, I'm assuming there's going to be a commensurate number of individuals who were removed."

Government defends its practices

In an earlier call with reporters, officials from the Department of Health and Human Services as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement defended the slow pace of family reunifications, citing a number of criminal records and other issues that came up when they checked into parents to meet today's court deadline.

"Our process may not be as quick as some would like, but there is no question that it is protecting children," said Chris Meekins, the chief of staff for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at HHS. "Let me be clear, HHS could have transferred every child out of ORR care to a parent who is in DHS custody today if we did not take into account child safety or if the adult is actually a parent."

He said if HHS was not careful, and had simply reunited all the kids without checks, "we would be putting them in the care of a rapist, a kidnapper, a child abuser and someone who is accused of being a murderer in their home nation."

The court documents and the call noted that in one child's case, for example, another adult in the home had a record of sexually abusing a 10-year-old girl. But the parent will be allowed to choose a different living situation and then apply again to be reunited with their kid.

As for parents who can't be located, the government indicated that the blame falls on the parent.

"There's a very large number of illegal aliens here in the country. A parent that's been released ... always has the capacity to go to HHS and request to sponsor their child out of HHS custody," said Matthew Albence, executive associate director of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. "That happens every day. So if these individuals choose not to do that, there's nothing we can do to force them, and it makes me question whether they were the parent in the first place."
__label__world (CNN) A female activist is facing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia for participating in and documenting anti-government protests, human rights groups said on Wednesday. If convicted, she could become the first female activist ever beheaded in the ultraconservative kingdom.

Israa al-Ghomgham and her husband are two of five Shia activists facing execution over charges relating to their involvement in protests calling for more rights for about two million Shia Muslims in the kingdom's Eastern Province, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International. A sixth co-defendant is standing trial but is not facing the death penalty

Saudi Arabia is a predominantly Sunni Muslim kingdom.

The charges against the group range from joining a terror group affiliated with an enemy state to participating in a protest and posting footage of it online, Germany-based Saudi activist Ali Adubisi told CNN.

But according to a statement from HRW, the charges "don't resemble recognizable crimes" and are "solely related to their peaceful activism."

The prosecutor called for the death penalty for al-Ghomgham, her husband and three other men during a court hearing earlier this month, according to Adubisi. It was the activists' first time in court following more than two years in detention in a Saudi prison.

The same Specialized Criminal Court, which handles terrorism cases, sentenced firebrand Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr and seven other men to death for their role in Shia protests in the same province. Al-Nimr and at least three other Shia men were executed in January 2016.

Saudi authorities have so far not responded to a CNN request for comment.

"Any execution is appalling, but seeking the death penalty for activists like Israa al-Ghomgham, who are not even accused of violent behavior, is monstrous," Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at HRW, said in a statement.

Reforms and crackdowns

Saudi Arabia, which adheres to some of the strictest interpretations of Sunni Islam in the world, has long faced criticism for laws that discriminate against women.

Over the past two years, the kingdom -- under the guidance of 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- has implemented a mixed bag of social reforms, opening its first cinema in decades and loosening several morality laws, including notorious rules requiring that women receive a male guardian's permission to travel, receive an education and sometimes work and receive health care.

In June, the country ended its ban on female drivers following decades of activism from both inside and outside the Gulf nation. But in recent months, the government also arrested a number of high-profile women who had campaigned to overturn the driving ban, casting doubt on the sincerity of the Crown Prince's much-touted reforms.

While some have since been released, a handful of the women remain detained without charge, according to HRW.
__label__world Kerala, India (CNN) Idicula Gevarghese, forced to abandon his home in the town of Venmoney in the southern Indian state of Kerala last week, returned with his family on Monday to the ruins of their lives.

Three of them -- himself, his wife and their granddaughter -- came back to the swamped house armed with disinfectant, and began the overwhelming task of clearing out five days of muck and water.

They had left in a hurry the previous week, anxious about getting stranded in the floodwaters that swept through the villages and towns of southern Kerala just a day later.

"Everyone left. So we also left. By the grace of God, at least we are living," he tells CNN.

Idicula Gevarghese stands with his wife, Susamma Dikla, and granddaughter Shobita outside their flooded home in Venmony, Kerala.

After they left, Gevarghese checked in on the property every day, watching as the swirling, filthy water rose inexorably, submerging their belongings.

Starting almost two weeks ago, large parts of Kerala were devastated as flash floods swept through the state. Some parts, like Gevarghese's home of Venmony, held out for a week, but eventually succumbed. Rivers overflowed and sewage lines were blocked as water rushed through streets and homes across large swaths of the state.

Victims of the floods wade through waist-deep water in Kerala.

He laments how much of the family's belongings are ruined -- the water pump, the fridge, their beds and sofas are all damaged. The wood of the cupboards is spoiled. He tells CNN that he's estimated his losses at around 100,000 rupees (about $1,400).

Residents of Venmony in Kerala wait outside their homes and shops for relief.

In almost every home in the area, it's the same story. Electronics have short-circuited and even the goods residents had piled on top of high shelves and on tables fell prey to the rising waters.

Among the ruins of Gevarghese's home, the strong odor of disinfectant can't mask the pervasive rotting smell of water-damaged wood and waterlogged upholstery.

Waiting for assistance

In Venmony families cluster together, sheltering on stoops outside their homes as they wait for some kind of relief.

A truck, carrying about 20 young men, rolls up. Cheers fill the streets and smiles break out as the men throw packets of biscuits and bottles of water into the crowd. Singling out women among the faces, the men hand out packets of sanitary pads as people run alongside the truck begging for candles.

Boats are used to rescue victims of the floodwaters.

With the power out for days, candles provide the only respite from the dark.

The truck's owner, Sam Daniel, collected the provisions from residents in his town 30 kilometers (around 19 miles) away, which escaped the floods. He decided that he needs to help out in this "severe situation."

He says that the government is too stretched to take care of these rural populations. "The government thinks that they need to manage relief camps. But what about isolated places like this?" he asks.

"(The residents) have money but what good will that do? Money can't help them here."

Rescuers wade through the floodwaters.

Emergency funds

But at the regional level, money is sorely needed.

The Kerala chief minister has estimated a total loss of over Rs 19,000 crore ($2.7 billion) from the devastating floods and has requested Rs 2,600 crore ($371 million) from the national government. So far Kerala has received only around the equivalent of Rs 600 crore ($85.8 million).

The government has allocated almost 90,000 tons of grain in emergency relief, which has been airlifted in by the Indian Air Force. Alongside food, 65 metric tons of emergency drugs, 10 million chlorine tablets and tons of bleaching powder have also been hurriedly dispatched.

An Indian air-force helicopter on rescue mission flies through a flooded area in Chengannur in the southern state of Kerala on August 19.

Collection centers have been set up across the state and tons of food, clothes, sanitary supplies, bottled water -- some of it donated by locals who escaped the worst of the rains and by nongovernmental organizations along with that purchased by the state government -- are loaded into trucks.

The state government has been pouring relief and material into the towns, racing against time to deal with possible outbreaks of disease, removing the remains of animals caught in the floods and trying to contain sewage.

Indian Army personnel and Kerala state police work to build a temporary bridge over a rocky river following heavy flooding in Nelliyampathy in Palakkad district of Kerala.

On the national highways crisscrossing the state, trucks carrying fishing boats from the coast to assist in the rescue line the streets and trucks loaded with supplies stand outside relief camps, set up ad hoc by the state government.

Coping

But even as the government is scrambling to reach out to everyone in the state, certain areas seem to have fallen off the radar.

In Venmony, even with knee-high water surrounding their house, Rohi Philip and a handful of his family members and neighbors seem cheerful and optimistic. After running low on supplies, they received some much-needed aid from the Fire and Safety force Sunday.

It couldn't have come any sooner. "We had only one candle last night for the entire group. We sat together in the dark after it went out," says Philip's son, Adarsh.

Nearby, 18-year-old Ashwin Dev and his parents had to take refuge in a neighbor's house. "Our fridge, washing machine, sofa sets -- all ruined," he says. His father drives an autorickshaw -- a cheap form of public transport -- and he says they have "no idea where the money to replace it will come from."

The government has asked residents to report their losses with the local village council or district officials in an attempt to reassure residents that they will be compensated. But Dev is all too familiar with the snail's pace of Indian bureaucracy and harbors serious doubts that they'll ever see the money.

The last two weeks have devastated one of the country's most developed states and while money is coming in, thanks to the government and the generosity of the Indian diaspora, the rehabilitation will take more than just money.

Idicula Gevarghese prepares to leave his uninhabitable home with his wife and looks out, into where his garden once thrived.

"It will take 20 to 25 years to bring Kerala back to what it was," he says.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Sixty former CIA officials warned President Donald Trump in a statement on Friday that "the country will be weakened if there is a political litmus test applied before seasoned experts are allowed to share their views."

The letter, which comes after Trump's decision to revoke former CIA Director John Brennan's security clearance, was signed by former CIA officials who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations in positions such as analysts, senior analysts and officers.

It adds to a growing outcry against the President's recent action and comes after more than a dozen former senior intelligence officials denounced the move as "ill-considered" and "unprecedented" in a separate statement.

"All of us believe it is critical to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure," reads the statement from the former CIA officials. "But we believe equally strongly that former government officials have the right to express their unclassified views on what they see as critical national security issues without fear of being punished for doing so."

The statement goes on to say, "Our signatures below do not necessarily mean that we concur with the opinions expressed by former Director Brennan or the way in which he expressed them. What they do represent, however, is our firm belief that the country will be weakened if there is a political litmus test applied before seasoned experts are allowed to share their views."

__label__politics (CNN) With the November midterm elections 89 days away, President Donald Trump has yet to sit down for an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump's legal team has suggested the timing of the midterms could affect the investigation.

Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Fox News on Wednesday that if the special counsel's investigation is not completed by September, then there would be a "very, very serious violation of Justice Department rules," because Mueller "shouldn't be conducting one of these investigations in the 60-day period."

That's false -- there is no such rule.

There are, in fact, long-standing customs at the Justice Department requiring caution around elections, but the breadth is widely misconstrued.

What's the general policy?

Under long-standing Justice Department custom, prosecutors are generally advised to avoid public disclosure of investigative steps involving a candidate for office or related to election matters within 60 days of an election.

To that end, attorneys general have issued memos over the years surrounding election "sensitivities," prohibiting the selection of the "timing of investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election."

The last memo on the topic issued by Attorney General Loretta Lynch in 2016 states: "politics must play no role in the decisions of federal investigators or prosecutors regarding any investigations or criminal charges. Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party."

This policy would apply to the special counsel, as Justice Department regulations stipulate Mueller's team must comply with "the rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies of the Department of Justice."

But is the 60-day custom a firm rule?

No. In fact, as the Justice Department's internal watchdog recently noted in a report about the 2016 election: "The 60-Day Rule is not written or described in any Department policy or regulation. Nevertheless, high-ranking Department and FBI officials acknowledged the existence of a general practice that informs Department decisions."

Ray Hulser, former section chief of the department's Public Integrity Section who now serves as a deputy assistant attorney general in the Criminal Division, told the Department of Justice Inspector General's Office that while working on one of the Election Year Sensitivities memos, "they considered codifying the substance of the 60-Day Rule, but that they rejected that approach as unworkable."

"Hulser told OIG that a prosecutor should look to the needs of the case and significant investigative steps should be taken 'when the case is ready, not earlier or later,' " according to the inspector general's report. "He said that there is not any such specific rule, and there never has been, but that there is a general admonition that politics should play no role in investigative decisions."

The controversy over former FBI Director James Comey's public announcements concerning the investigation of Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information before the 2016 presidential election highlighted the stakes involved in such decisions.

Even though Trump isn't on the ballot in November, Mueller may still adhere to the general custom of avoiding publicly revealing investigative steps near election time that could wait. But there is no firm rule preventing him from filing charges or taking other action if it cannot wait until after the election.

So how does this affect Mueller's work?

Contrary to Giuliani's assertion to Fox, Mueller is free to keep investigating beyond Sept. 7 -- 60 days before the midterms -- but is supposed to avoid doing anything overt, according to Justice Department custom.

"This long-standing policy is clear on its face," says Jamie Gorelick, who served as the Justice Department's deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration. "Of course it does not require an investigation to be terminated. Indeed, there are many examples of investigations that continued during and through elections."

And more to the point -- unlike the now-lapsed statute that created independent counsels, Mueller is being supervised by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein under different regulations that provide oversight.

Under those regulations, Rosenstein "may request that the Special Counsel provide an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step" and may reject any action if he concludes it is "inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices."

Bottom line: Mueller's authority is not unbounded -- but the rule Giuliani asserted does not exist.

This story is part of " Masters of Experience ," a series exploring the world's most original experiences, as told by the visionaries who crafted them.

The ancient craft of urushi, or Japanese lacquerware, is one of Asia's oldest artistic traditions. Evidence for the use of lacquer -- a tree sap used to coat and decorate objects like boxes, bowls and furniture -- dates back approximately 9,000 years

But although Kazumi Murose, one of the craft's greatest living practitioners, is grounded in history, he's not restricted by it. When not producing intricately decorated wooden items, the 67-year-old Twitter user can be found giving TED talks and designing handsets for the luxury cellphone brand Vertu.

"It is the creator's job to turn the atmosphere of the age into tangible shape, whether you're a modern or traditional artist," he said.

Yet, whether through contemporary or conventional means, Murose's goal has remained the same: to protect a historic craft from obsolescence. A dedicated conservator and surveyor of lacquerware collections around the world, he was, in 2008, named a "Living National Treasure" -- a government accolade recognizing individuals who help preserve Japan's oldest traditions.

"Culture is different from civilization," Murose said. "What a robot does is not culture, it's civilization. Culture is what we create with our hands.

"Taking your time and undertaking something cumbersome is, for me, (the definition of) culture. I very much respect my predecessors who decided that it was important to stop the decay of these values, and to carry on this culture for the next generation."

Built to last

Collected from Asian lacquer trees, the musky-smelling sap essential to urushi is toxic to humans when wet. Once dried, however, it can be used as an adhesive or coating for wood, leather and other materials.

Murose specializes in two specific lacquerware techniques -- maki-e and raden. The former, (which literally translates as "sprinkled picture") sees him scattering gold and silver decorations onto or between layers of black or red lacquer. The latter involves the use of seashells, mother of pearl and other iridescent materials found in nature.

The result is a career's worth of delicate, yet striking, creations. From dainty and decorative to bold and practical, his output spans boxes, bowls, chessboards, tables, incense holders and even a harp.

Murose's pieces often look to nature, like pruned Japanese gardens rendered in lustrous gold. Other designs are altogether more abstract. But he has often focused on function over form, eschewing the sculptural tendencies of many of his contemporaries. His creations, while too valuable to enter daily use, are technically functional and built to last.

"Urushi won't decay for hundreds of years -- it's the law of the nature," Murose said. "It is made and used on a timescale that is centuries beyond that of human lives.

"We must make something that people will still love in hundreds of years' time. (My work) is not only for the satisfaction of today's people."

This idea of timelessness has inspired Murose to slow the speed at which he creates his lacquerware. An item can take ten months to a year to complete, he said -- even two for a larger piece. He once spent five years working on a huge wooden chest.

A single surface requires multiple layers of lacquer, with each taking between three and five days to dry. Urushi is a craft that rewards the patient.

"What I learned the most from urushi is how difficult it is to wait," Murose said. "In the modern world, you must get results and produce answers immediately. But there is no paint on earth that needs as much waiting time (as lacquer).

"In today's Japan, people seek things that are fast, light, short and compact. Urushi offers totally opposing values. When I was young, I wanted to see fast outcomes, but urushi taught that young man (the value of) endurance."

A craft under threat

Murose grew up surrounded by lacquerware. The son of renowned urushi artist, he first helped his father on a wall decoration at the age of 14. The experience -- and the public recognition the piece received -- made a lasting impression, he said.

Nonetheless, the young craftsman was uncertain about the prospect of a career in urushi. With the tradition under threat, people around Murose advised him against dedicating himself to a dying art.

"In the end, I decided to go for it," he explained. "If this art was to become extinct, then I would just become the last person to do it, I thought. I wanted to see how things went ... and if (urushi) did really disappear, that would make it easier to give up what I really wanted."

Despite Murose's best efforts, he remains worried about the craft's future. But he also takes encouragement from an apparent resurgence both inside and outside Japan. With his pieces previously exhibited at the British Museum and the V&A in London, Murose reported an increased interest in his work from overseas buyers.

"In the past 40 years, the number of people working in this industry has declined," he admitted. "However, the trend has changed to an increase in the last 10 years, and some young people are joining us.

"With 40 years of long downhill, a little uphill is a positive sign for us."
__label__world (CNN) Myanmar civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi will not be stripped of her Nobel Peace Prize, the award's committee told CNN Wednesday, despite allegations by the United Nations that her government is committing genocide.

An independent UN investigation recommended on Monday that Myanmar's top military leaders be investigated and prosecuted for genocide over alleged human rights abuses committed against the minority Muslim Rohingya over the past six months.

The allegations leveled by the report include indiscriminate killing, gang rape, assaulting children and the destruction of entire villages.

However, there is "no provision" within the Nobel statutes to strip a winner of a prize, Norwegian Nobel Institute Director Olav Njolstad told CNN by phone.

"We continue to call on all involved in Myanmar to ease the suffering of the Rohingya and cease their persecution and suppression," Njolstad said.
__label__politics (CNN) White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Wednesday falsely blamed journalists for thwarting US spying on Osama bin Laden just years before the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

"The media routinely reports on classified information and government secrets that put lives in danger and risks valuable national security tools," Sanders said Wednesday as she answered a question about threats and insults reporters have faced from Trump supporters. "One of the worst cases was the reporting on the US ability to listen to Osama Bin Laden's satellite phone in the late 90s. Because of that reporting, he stopped using that phone and the country lost valuable intelligence."

That assertion is false and it has previously been debunked years ago.

Sanders did not respond to CNN requests asking which article she was specifically referring to, but Sanders appeared to be drawing on a claim by former President George W. Bush and the 9/11 Commission.

Bush and the commission in 2005 blamed an August 1998 article in The Washington Times for revealing that the US government had the ability to monitor bin Laden's satellite communications.

__label__world New Delhi (CNN) What was meant to be a simple uneventful local election has sparked uncertainty over the future of Sri Lanka's political landscape, after a newly formed party led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa swept to victory.

The return of Rajapaksa to public life marks an unlikely turnaround for the two-time former president, who was unceremoniously voted out of office in 2015, amid allegations of corruption, nepotism and war crimes.

Considered a military hero among supporters, 72-year-old Rajapaksa was first elected president in 2005 and returned to office in 2010, a year after government forces routed Tamil rebel groups to end the country's brutal 25-year civil war. His surprise victory last Sunday now threatens to upend a still fragile political system marred by years of conflict and instability.

Former Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapakse holds a newspaper displaying areas where his party won local government seats during a press conference in Colombo on February 12, 2018.

Addressing reporters at a press conference in the wake of the result, Rajapaksa called for the immediate dissolution of parliament and a snap national election.

"The victory is a clear indication that Sri Lankans are fed up of inaction and want to rebuild Sri Lanka," said Rajapaksa in a message posted on his official Facebook page

By effectively transforming the local election into a referendum on the country's ruling party, Rajapaksa has positioned himself as the figurehead of growing anti-government movement.

Rajapaksa's campaign targeted the government's middling economic record, and its attempt to impose higher taxes, promising Sri Lankans a return to more confident, outward facing rule. Rajapaksa's supporters also criticized Sri lankan President Maithripala Sirisena for selling off national assets, including a controversial 99-year lease granted to China for the Hambantota port.

Uncertainty looms

Though parliamentary elections are not scheduled for another two years, Rajapaksa's comeback comes at a perilous time for the country's first postwar national government, who have been stymied by infighting and accusations of political inaction.

Led by Sirisena, the current administration was formed in 2015 with the help of a disparate coalition of minority groups, promising a more decentralized, transparent form of governance that would usher in a new post-war era of prosperity for the island nation.

Instead, Sirisena, a former health minister under Rajapaksa, has struggled to maintain unity among his coalition partners while attempting to implement his ambitious reform agenda.

Sri Lankans queue up to cast their vote in the country's local elections at a polling station in Colombo on February 10, 2018.

Rajapaksa's Podujana Peramuna, also known as People's Front won 44.65% of the seats available in the local vote, sweeping aside Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's United National Party (UNP) who claimed just 32.63%, and the United People's Freedom Alliance (UFPA), a coalition led by Sirisena's Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) who came third with just 8.94%.

The opposition had not anticipated the scale of the victory, Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based think tank, Center for Policy Alternatives, told CNN.

"There was always the argument that they (Podujana Peramuna) would probably emerge as first or second but they emerged as the largest party in terms of votes and councils by quite a large number," said Saravanamuttu, who attributed the result to problems relating to "command, control and communication" within the ruling coalition.

"The President himself started attacking his coalition partners and thought that he would win voters but that did not happen at all. The government has been abysmal in its ability to communicate as to what it's doing, why it is doing what it is doing, and what it intends to be doing," added Saravanamuttu.

Snap election?

Under the constitution, an early election can only be held with the endorsement of two-thirds of parliament, but with the ruling coalition weakened, the possibility of a snap election cannot be ruled out, say analysts.

"There's going to be a lot of jockeying in the parliament, within the parties. The dust won't settle for another couple of weeks," said Alan Keenan, a senior Sri Lanka analyst at the London-based Crisis Group. "A lot of people will begin gravitating back towards Rajapaksa," he added.

Former Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapakse waves to supporters at the party office following a press conference after winning the local government election in the capital Colombo on February 12, 2018.

According to local Sri Lankan media reports, Sirisena is expected to make a special statement on the future course of National Unity Government before the weekend.

"The government will need to figure out how to come together. They need to go back to the drawing board and return to their fundamental principles and start to deliver," said Keenan.

Lingering controversies

Despite his recent electoral success, Rajapaksa remains a controversial figure in Sri Lanka, where scars from the decades-long civil war have yet to heal.

Rajapaksa has long dismissed the report, and while in power refused to open an internal investigation into the findings

According to the UN report, between September 2008 and May 2009, tens of thousands of civilians were killed in Vanni in northern Sri Lanka, a period that coincides with an advancement into the same area by the Sri Lankan army.

Rajapaksa's brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, was Sri Lanka's defense secretary at the time and in charge of government forces.

The government described the report as "biased, baseless and unilateral."

May arrived in country's capital Abuja on Wednesday and met with Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari, where they both witnessed the signing of the two separate bilateral pacts.

May is on a three-nation African tour to drum up new business ahead of Britain's scheduled departure from the EU next March.

She pledged the UK's support for Nigeria particularly in areas of security, trade, asset recovery and its fight against corruption.

During the trip, she told reporters: "We have long-standing relations with Nigeria and long-standing, close commercial ties with Nigeria. There are British companies that have been here in Nigeria for many, many years. We want to enhance those trading links."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Republican Sen. John McCain had one more message for his fellow Americans.

In a letter read by longtime aide Rick Davis on Monday , McCain encouraged Americans to unite around the ideals that connect them rather than focus on divisions. He also pointedly asked Americans to tear down walls rather than build them.

"We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe," Davis read from McCain's letter. "We weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down, when we doubt the power of our ideals, rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been."

In his letter, McCain noted he had lived a "rewarding life," full of friendships and love, adventure and even at times extraordinary hardship that he wouldn't trade.

"I have tried to serve our country honorably. I've made mistakes, but I hope my love for America will be weighed favorably against them," McCain's letter read. "I have often observed that I am the luckiest person on earth. I feel that way even now as I prepare for the end of my life. I have loved my life, all of it. I have had experiences, adventures and friendships enough for 10 satisfying lives, and I am so thankful. Like most people, I have regrets. But I would not trade a day of my life, in good or bad times, for the best day of anyone else's. "

__label__politics Washington (CNN) White House counsel Don McGahn has cooperated extensively with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, participating in several interviews spanning 30 hours over the last nine months, The New York Times reported Saturday.

McGahn has provided "detailed accounts about the episodes at the heart of the inquiry into whether President Trump obstructed justice," including providing information that the Mueller team otherwise would not have learned about, the Times reported, citing a dozen current and former White House officials and other individuals briefed on the matter.

A source familiar with McGahn's thinking told CNN on Saturday that McGahn and Mueller's team had "several, several" hours discussions on at least three occasions. CNN previously reported there had been three interviews between McGahn and Mueller's team.

The Times reported that McGahn's decision to cooperate was partly due to the fact that the President's initial legal team had decided to fully cooperate with Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, believing their client had nothing to hide and they could bring a quick end to the probe.

The source familiar with McGahn's thinking told CNN that the strategy of the President's legal team surprised those close to McGahn, who thought Trump's lawyers would have placed limits on an interview, or, if they refused to allow the interview outright, would have entered into a subpoena fight. There was a feeling that the President's legal team "opened the cupboard door" to everything, the source said.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in North Korea looking for concrete steps toward denuclearization and a timeframe for talks, but he may well leave disappointed.

Two US officials and other sources familiar with preparations for the trip say the top US diplomat is expected to get some clarity on other issues: the return of US service member remains from the Korean War, a timeline for the destruction of a missile test site that President Donald Trump said was already being dismantled and a sense of who his North Korean negotiating partner will be.

But Pompeo, who has staked his political future on efforts to dismantle the isolated country's nuclear program, may return to Washington with few details on how and when Kim will dismantle his nuclear weapons, these officials and sources say.

This forecast for Pompeo's third trip to North Korea in as many months highlights wider challenges the administration is having in pulling together a coherent approach on its greatest foreign policy challenge to date - and a growing sense of concern.

No clarity on next steps

Current officials, diplomatic sources and others familiar with internal policy discussions say the Trump administration has yet to agree with the North Koreans on a common goal or timeline, or on who will run point on detailed negotiations with Pyongyang alongside Pompeo. These sources say the situation seems characterized by a fair degree of chaos regarding next steps.

North Korean foot dragging is compounding the problem, these sources say, along with a slew of domestic challenges ranging from incomplete staffing, intelligence leaks, rivalries within the Cabinet and presidential tweets that ratchet up the pressure on Pompeo by presenting an overly rosy picture.

Administration officials familiar with the work on North Korea say they see cause for worry if Pompeo returns from this latest trip without a definite plan in hand for moving forward. There's a sense within the White House and at the State Department that they need a solid time line or some specifics on North Korea's denuclearization at the latest by the end of August.

Soon after, suspended military exercises with South Korea - which Trump and Pompeo have called "war games," using North Korean terminology - are due to start up again. There is also speculation that Trump and Kim may meet again at the UN General Assembly, which takes place every September.

Lead Starr north korea trump pompeo dnt _00002705.jpg

At the State Department, a senior official said Pyongyang understands the stakes, knows that Kim Jong Un needs to offer Pompeo something to prove his seriousness and do it soon.

Speaking to reporters at Yokota Air Base in Japan, on his way to North Korea, Pompeo referred to the June 12 summit in Singapore between Trump and Kim.

"Our leaders made commitments at the Singapore Summit on the complete denuclearization of North Korea and outlined what a transformed US-DPRK relationship could look like," Pompeo said. "Since the summit, the consultations have continued. On this trip I'm seeking to fill in some details on those commitments and continue the momentum towards implementation of what the two leaders promised each other and the world. I expect that the DPRK is ready to do the same."‎

After his arrival in North Korea, Pompeo met on Friday with Kim Yong Chul, the vice chairman of the country's Party Central Committee who met with Trump in Washington in May. Kim said the meeting was "very meaningful," and Pompeo agreed, saying, "I count on it being very productive." He said he had joked that "if I come one more time I'll have to pay taxes here."

Kim hinted that the process might be a long one. "The more you come, more trust we can build between one another," he said. Pompeo joked that "if I come one more time I'll have to pay taxes here."

‎But also on Friday, the research group 38 North released a report noting ongoing testing of a light water reactor, or perhaps its new operations, as well as recently completed construction. 38 North tracks North Korea's nuclear and missile program through satellite imagery.

There are any number of other challenges.

At the State Department, below Pompeo, the staffing is still unsettled and a central job - the assistant secretary for east Asia and pacific affairs - remains unfilled. Because there is no agreement with North Korean yet about the composition of delegations or structure of negotiations, officials say that Pompeo is essentially acting as the desk officer, or hands-on staffer, on Korea right now - a job that should be delegated.

One source noted that Pompeo not only is working without a fully assembled team, but that he's relatively new to this kind of role, with only a year of executive experience. And though Pompeo is devoting much of his time to the North Korea file, he is also being pushed by the White House to show progress.

Trump's tweets and declarations that things are "going well" and that "there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea to deal with" only ratchet up the pressure to produce results.

Pompeo has repeatedly said that Kim has promised to dismantle his weapons programs, and tweeted before he left for Pyongyang that he was "looking forward to continuing our work toward the final, fully verified denuclearization of #DPRK, as agreed to by Chairman Kim."

But defense and administration officials working on the North Korea portfolio say it's still not clear whether the US and North Korea will be able to agree on the definition and extent of that denuclearization promise.

Questions remain about whether Kim is willing to give up civilian nuclear programs, research, his missiles and warheads, or whether he would put North Korea's satellite launch program on the table as well.

Constant conflict

At every stage of negotiations, as Pompeo asks North Korea to do things, these officials say that Kim will respond by asking what he gets in return.

Pompeo also has to contend with tough opponents at home. He and national security adviser John Bolton are in constant conflict over North Korea, administration sources tell CNN.

Bolton, who has spent decades watching and working on Pyongyang, has advocated for regime change and largely been shut out of this most recent attempt at diplomacy.

While Pompeo has told CNN he won't set a timeline on talks and just needs to see continued progress, Bolton recently told CBS that the administration has set a year deadline to have Pyongyang break up all its missile and weapons programs. The comment was seen in some circles as an attempt to box Pompeo in.

"I'm sure that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be discussing this with the North Koreans in the near future about really how to dismantle all of their WMD and ballistic missile programs in a year," Bolton told 'Face the Nation.'

Pompeo is also facing headwinds from a series of intelligence leaks outlining CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency conclusions that Kim has no intention to give up his nuclear weapons anytime soon.

Trump shrugged those reports off on Thursday, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One.

"We'll see. We'll see. All I can tell you is this. You haven't had one missile launch and you haven't had one rocket launch," he said.

He also emphasized his personal chemistry with Kim.

"I had a very good feeling about him from the standpoint - I shook his hand. I thought we got along very well. I thought we had a good chemistry together. I think we understand each other. I really believe that he sees a different future for North Korea. I hope that's true. If that's not true we'll go back to the other way," he said.

A source who recently left the administration said the intelligence leaks might be a result of frustration within the intelligence community that Trump and his secretary of state are talking up a regime that is one of the most untrustworthy and dangerous the US has ever dealt with.

'Definitively untrustworthy'

"They're probably fed up with the fact that POTUS and Pompeo keep publicly touting their trust in one of the most definitively untrustworthy regimes the US has ever negotiated with," the source said. Using Kim's initials in place of his name, the source said that the intelligence community "doesn't assess that KJU is acting in good faith."

The leaks about North Korea have generated concern at the White House and frustrated some State Department officials who suspect an attempt to undermine the President.

Within the National Security Council, there is some concern that the leaks could undermine the talks, according to the source who recently left the administration.

Most NSC staff believe that it's too early to judge the administration's progress with North Korea, given that Trump and Kim met less than a month ago. But there is worry that intelligence leaks painting Kim as unwilling to denuclearize may diminish the likelihood that he will cooperate, "if he thinks that, no matter what he does, the US has already prejudged him to be untrustworthy," the source said.

At the State Department, the senior state official called the leaks a "very curious phenomenon" that "almost seemed coordinated." The source suspected it could be out of a desire to undercut the president, but didn't know for sure.

That official said State and Pompeo are aware that the North Koreans aren't acting on denuclearization yet, but said it wasn't surprising and that Pompeo sees it as an attempt to play hardball before negotiations start in earnest.
__label__politics Stubborn and flawed, he survived many a brush with death and spent a lifetime trying to live up to the larger than life characters he idolized, both real and fictional. Until the end, he was still a hot dog fighter pilot with a dramatic flair. Quick to anger, but equally quick to forgive and always eager to share a laugh. He cherished his family and was unusually open with the depth of his love for his friends. A towering figure despite his less than towering stature.

The John McCain I first started to get to know in earnest was the one who had just returned to the US Senate after losing the 2000 Republican presidential primary.

I was a CNN producer then, and though I had been in New Hampshire in and around the famous Straight Talk Express, I mostly covered the Democratic side of that 2000 contest -- Bill Bradley versus Al Gore.

Back in the Senate, the McCain I encountered was understandably smarting from the vicious and personal way fellow Republicans went after him and his family in the South Carolina. His loss there pretty much sealed his fate -- and now he was in full maverick mode. That meant diving into work on several bills with Democrats that most Republicans hated. The top of that list was campaign finance reform.

It was the first real legislative fight that I ever covered in the reporting trenches on Capitol Hill. Looking back, I learned so much watching McCain dart around the halls of Congress, working alongside his Democratic partner, Russ Feingold, and sparring with his arch enemy on the issue -- Mitch McConnell.

McCain was so passionate and determined, but he was also practical. He understood what a heavy lift it was to get a 60-vote, filibuster-proof margin on something that lawmakers feared would hurt their ability to campaign to keep their jobs. I lost track of how many times they compromised on a sticking point, thought they were close, then got outsmarted by McConnell and his side, and we all raced to the press gallery as McCain marched in to keep up the public pressure.

He was relentless, and ultimately successful.

In my youth and naiveté, I thought that was how the Senate actually works -- like it is supposed to. Legislate, negotiate, pass a bill, make a bipartisan law.

Of course, watching McCain's other big legislative battles, especially immigration reform on which he spent more than a decade working with no law to show for it, I soon learned that was not the case.

A sense of history

Another vivid memory is from the Authorization of Force debate after the September 11 attacks.

Senators were going back and forth with drafts of the resolution language, and I remember at one point early on, seeing McCain in the hallway and asking what he thought.

He looked at me and said at the top of his lungs with an "are-you-kidding-me?" look on his face, "We can't accept this! Don't you remember the Gulf of Tonkin?"

I had learned about it in history, but of course, McCain had lived it.

President Johnson used the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, passed after US ships were attacked in the Pacific, to send troops to Vietnam and escalate the war without declaring it. It was a war that McCain fought in as a naval aviator until he was shot down and held as a prisoner of war for more than five years. McCain spent a lot of time at the Naval War College after he was finally released studying how the civilian and military leaders had gotten things so wrong in Vietnam. He knew the answers. The Gulf of Tonkin helped set things in the wrong direction.

And then there was the issue of torture. There is nothing more powerful than watching a man get so passionate in the hallways talking to us reporters that he wants to raise his arms, but he can't because they were broken so many times during brutal beatings when he was a prisoner of war. Now imagine him doing that while arguing against America's use of torture after 9/11. That happened more times than I can count during his crusade to get the Bush administration to stop the practice of enhanced interrogation tactics with terror suspects. He said he knew from being tortured himself that they didn't work.

And more importantly, that is not how America acts, despite the raw fear after the 2001 attacks.

Covering McCain's 2008 presidential bid

When I was first assigned to cover the Republican presidential race in 2007, that meant covering John McCain. He was the next in line, and at that point that mattered in the GOP. He built up his war chest. He amassed a big campaign. He was the guy to beat, just as George W. Bush was in 2000.

Until it collapsed.

GOP primary voters, already skeptical of McCain, did not like his support for the Iraq surge, and more importantly, his support for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants -- legislation he worked on with liberals like Ted Kennedy.

I remember doing a story one night about the right wing coming after him, and I had interviewed a couple of conservative characters who had long been McCain opponents. The next day he saw me in the hallway and ripped into me. How could I give air time to people who make a living off of tearing apart the GOP, never mind the country. I don't think it was the first time I was yelled at by McCain, which I later learned was a rite of passage, but it was the first time I remember feeling his wrath to that extent directed at me.

Ten years later when I sat in the Senate chamber watching McCain speak after returning from brain cancer surgery, his warning to colleagues to stop paying attention to talk radio and people who profit off of division took me back to that McCain tongue lashing.

Eventually, McCain of course climbed back to win the 2008 GOP nomination, and I was on the road with him full-time. It was an experience of a lifetime to cover a presidential campaign start to finish. At first, he ran the campaign the way he did in 2000 -- with freewheeling discussions with reporters on his bus and his plane. But as the general election really took off, that stopped. His aides tightened it up and tried to stay on a message a day, and letting their candidate answer questions all day long didn't allow for that.

I sensed McCain missed the more chaotic atmosphere, but I also understood that he felt a bit betrayed by the press. He had been the one reporters liked to cover, and now the focus was on the history making candidate on the other side. To be sure, those of us who followed McCain day in and day out tried to play it straight with every story, but it was impossible for McCain to escape the reality that Barack Obama generated the excitement and drew the giant crowds.

I remember the day Obama made his big speech in Germany before tens of thousands of people. McCain counter programmed by going to see George H.W. Bush at his home in Maine. It was a terrific visit for those of us in the press because the former president, ever the gentleman, showed us all around the Kennebunkport compound. But when it came to pure imagery, it was McCain and Bush on a golf cart riding around in Maine, up against Obama speaking to a sea of people at the Brandenberg Gate. There is no question it was tough for McCain.

And then there was the Sarah Palin pick.

What I remember as much as the dysfunction internally about a series of disastrous Palin interviews that undermined McCain's ready-to-be-commander-in-chief platform, was the brewing strain of intolerance in the McCain-Palin crowds. We all remember the famous moment in Minnesota when McCain took the microphone away from a voter who called Obama an "Arab." But leading up to that was a lot of consternation about signs appearing at McCain's rallies and people in the crowds heckling with racist undertones. He hated it. He tried to stop it and that culminated with that town hall moment. That was because it was already clear to McCain something was happening in the base that he did not like, and that was the backdrop for his extraordinary concession speech urging his supporters to back Obama, marking the moment in history for the country despite his loss.

I remember standing on the press riser at the Biltmore Hotel watching him deliver that speech on election night 2008 and thinking how remarkable it was, but I only now realize how truly extraordinary it was through the prism of today's times.

Just a few of his lessons

Despite the complexities of the man, what his death means for America is even more complex. Sure, he was an American hero. Yes, a war hero. He was a conservative who fought for smaller government yet revered the institutions of government and democracy. He was passionate about his beliefs, but also understood the art of compromise for the greater good.

He had a unique voice. He knew it and he wasn't afraid to use it. He was an unofficial ambassador for America for decades, traveling the world trying help dissidents fighting for freedom and basic rights and believing to his core that America has an obligation to use its power.

I am forever grateful to McCain for teaching me to be serious without taking myself too seriously, to have meaningful debates and discussions without being mean, and to learn early on how to run through the Capitol hallways in heels, because that was the only way to keep up with him.
__label__world (CNN) A three-year-old boy has been seriously injured in a suspected acid attack in a shop in the English city of Worcester, police said.

The boy was left with serious burns to the face and arms after what police believe was a "deliberate attack" in the Home Bargains store on Saturday afternoon.

A 39-year-old man from the nearby town of Wolverhampton has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. He remains in police custody, local West Mercia Police said in a statement.

CCTV images of three men police want to speak to about the incident.

Police on Sunday also released CCTV photos of three men they would like to speak to in connection with the incident, adding "they may have information vital to the investigation."

"At this time we are treating this as a deliberate attack on a three-year-old boy," West Mercia Police Chief Superintendent Mark Travis said in a statement.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence said in an interview airing Sunday that he has not discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump from office.

"No. Never," Pence told CBS's "Face the Nation" host Margaret Brennan when asked if he'd had conversations about invoking the 25th Amendment, adding, "Why would we be, Margaret?"

Pence, in his rebuke of the claim, quickly pivoted to a speech former President Barack Obama delivered Friday that was seen as a pointed critique of Trump.

"I mean the truth of the matter is over the last eight years despite what we heard from President Obama on Friday, I mean this country was struggling ... it was the weakest economy since the Great Depression," Pence said.

(CNN) Donald Trump is President, but he is not king of America; the country is not his private property.

When he was running his "Trump Organization," he was free to hold secret meetings -- even with his enemies -- to ignore everyone's advice and then tell no one what transpired. But the US is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trumpworld, and the country needs answers about what happened in Helsinki. So far, we have virtually nothing. All we have is a new plan likely to make it all worse with another meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

On Thursday, America's top intelligence official, Director of National Security Dan Coats happened to be on stage, on camera, when he was informed by NBC's Andrea Mitchell that the White House had just tweeted yet another bombshell: Trump had invited Putin to visit the White House this fall. His reaction -- a deep breath, exhalation, nervous laughter -- confirms the danger. "That's going to be special," Coats said, to more nervous laughter in the audience.

Coats had already said he was not consulted about Trump's Helsinki summit and would have advised against it. After hours spent with the Russian President, Trump went on to disparage the conclusions from Coats and other intelligence agencies: that Putin not only led attacks on US democracy in 2016 but continues to do so and plans further interference in US elections this fall, when Putin presumably will be Trump's guest.

This, to put it mildly, is a travesty.

The dispute between Russia and the United States is not a Hatfield and McCoy feud -- the notorious decades long dispute between two families in the South — perpetuated over ancient grievances. There is a reason why the US and its allies imposed sanctions on Russia. The tensions are caused by ongoing grievances, of which Russia's assault on American democracy is only one. Russia continues perpetrating egregious actions against its own citizens, against its neighbors and against America's allies. In Russia, Putin's critics are routinely suspiciously murdered. Those who go against the Russian President are not safe even in England.

But Trump, for reasons that may ultimately be explained by the Mueller investigation, is determined to transform America's ties to Russia. His actions are already affecting US foreign policy on symbolic, substantive, and shameful fronts.

A recent example is the Trump administration's silence during this week's anniversary of the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which killed 298 people, most of them citizens of the Netherlands, a loyal ally of the US. Dutch soldiers fought in Afghanistan to support America's post-9/11 campaign and dozens of them died there.

An international investigation concluded that MH17 was shot down by a missile belonging to Russian military forces in Ukraine. This year, as it did on every anniversary, the State Department prepared a strong statement. It called on Russia to stop its "callous disinformation campaign and acknowledge its role." But the statement was reportedly deleted from the State Department website, and Washington remained silent.

Trump has been aligning his views with Putin on NATO, attacking newest member Montenegro , which is very telling and enormously troubling.

Americans still don't know what happened in that Helsinki meeting, but Russia has been making intriguing comments. The day after the summit, Russia's defense ministry said it was ready to implement the agreements the two presidents reached. The next day, Russia's ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, speaking in Moscow, vaguely described "important verbal agreements," and on Thursday, Putin said in a speech that he and Trump had made "useful agreements."

JUST WATCHED Intel chief: Don't know what happened in Trump-Putin meeting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Intel chief: Don't know what happened in Trump-Putin meeting 01:16

To what did Trump commit America? Nobody is quite sure. Coats doesn't know. The National Security Council doesn't seem to fully know. According to a spokesman, they are still "reviewing the discussion." The top US general in the Middle East doesn't know.

The President gave us a hint on Twitter, referencing "things discussed" in his "very successful" summit, including, terrorism, the Middle East (possibly meaning Syria), Israel, Ukraine, trade, and other topics.

What we did hear in the Helsinki press conference is reason enough for alarm. On stage there, Trump characterized as "an incredible offer" Putin's proposal to have Russian agents question American citizens, including former US ambassador Mike McFaul, in exchange for US officials interviewing indicted Russian agents. The idea was so outrageous that the Senate rejected it by a 98-0 vote. On Thursday, the White House said that Trump now disagrees with Putin's proposal.

There is talk of other plans. Antonov said one agreement was to "cooperate" in Syria. Congress, in its National Defense Authorization Act, banned "military-to-military cooperation" between the US and Russia after Russia seized Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. The head of US forces in the Middle East says he knows nothing of a new agreement, which could require congressional action.

But Congress, part of whose job is to prevent presidential abuse of power, is guilty of gross negligence. With US intelligence repeatedly confirming Russian cyberattacks on the elections, the Republican-controlled House defeated a proposal to increase security spending for the elections.

Remember, Trump once, incredibly, touted a Putin idea to establish a joint US-Russian cybersecurity force. The idea seemed to resurface in Helsinki when Putin suggested that the US and Russia should work together to go through evidence of Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

So, now, when we still don't know what happened in Helsinki, Trump's Washington invite to Putin is scandalous.

Let's speak plainly: The United States is currently investigating whether agents for Trump and Putin worked together, secretly, illegally, to subvert the 2016 election. No matter how many times Trump inserts the words "no collusion" into unrelated sentences, we still don't know what occurred, and what may or may not be happening now. The special counsel has issued dozens of indictments, so this is not a "witch hunt."

Trump's behavior has done nothing to allay the worst fears of many Americans, quite the contrary. Against this reality, how is it possible that Trump was allowed to meet in secret with Putin? Against that reality, plus the mysteries surrounding the first meeting, how is it possible that the US government, people, institutions, will seemingly allow it to happen again? This is malpractice of the highest order.

Trump is not king. No matter what his approval ratings among Republicans, government officials have a duty to the country. Standing by and just watching another meeting take place -- and failing to find out what happened in the last one -- would amount to a dereliction of duty.
__label__politics (CNN) For as long as history remembers Donald Trump, it will be a day that will live in infamy.

The President's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday is already one of the most notorious moments in the tortured relations between Washington and Moscow.

Trump's humiliation is taking its place alongside John Kennedy's bruising at the hands of Nikita Khrushchev, and George W. Bush staring into Putin's eyes and getting a sense of his soul.

Like those moments in US-Russia summit lore, the events that unfolded Monday are likely to have significant and unpredictable political and geopolitical reverberations in the United States and around the world.

Trump's favoring of Putin's denial of election interference accusations leveled by the US intelligence community was not just the most abject display given by any President overseas, it may be the moment that finally validated claims that Trump prizes his own interests above those of America.

The most obvious question -- why did Trump cave so spectacularly to Putin -- is likely to remain cloudy going forward, at least unless special counsel Robert Mueller finds evidence the President is beholden to the Russian leader.

But there are going to be profound consequences in Washington and beyond.

Here is what may happen next.

Trump WILL fight back

In 1961, Kennedy emerged from a roughing up by Soviet leader Khrushchev in Vienna and admitted to James Reston of The New York Times that their meeting had been the worst thing in his life.

It's no surprise that Trump showed no similar self-awareness in a sympathetic interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News on Monday, but Kennedy's description of his humiliation would be a good summation of the 45th President's encounter with Putin.

Objectively, Trump has emerged from the summit a diminished figure.

He looked weak. He was obsequious to the stone-faced Russian leader and came across as unprepared and outmatched. He looked as far as it is possible to be from his own self-image as a bullying tough-as-nails dealmaker, the man who boasted at the Republican National Convention in 2016 that "I alone can fix it."

The myth of Trump as an American strongman may never recover.

It is already clear that the summit is a short-term political disaster for Trump. For a man who jealously guards his image, the mockery will sting and is already provoking the biggest backlash of his presidency.

"This is a major mistake ... this is not a mistake of words, by the way, this is not a bad PR kerfuffle. This is a mistake of strategy and execution. This is a mistake of thinking and you have your ego involved," Scaramucci told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day."

"He has to speak out about it and reverse course immediately."

Top Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan, who normally don't criticize him, put distance between themselves and Trump.

"The President must appreciate that Russia is not our ally, there is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia," Ryan said in a written statement.

Even Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, rediscovered his roots as an old Cold Warrior.

President Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin. It is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected—-immediately. — Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) July 16, 2018

"President Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin. It is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected -- immediately," Gingrich tweeted.

Trump tried to clean up his mess in tweets as he flew home across the Atlantic.

"As I said today and many times before, 'I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people,'" he wrote. "However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past -- as the world's two largest nuclear powers, we must get along!"

As I said today and many times before, "I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people." However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past -- as the world's two largest nuclear powers, we must get along! #HELSINKI2018 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2018

A normal President might rethink his approach to leadership.

It was his hubris and desire to be unchained from his staff that led him to meet Putin alone for nearly two hours in Helsinki -- fueling rumors that he is under the Russian leader's spell. His claim that he was ready for what would be the "easier" leg of his European tour now looks damning. Trump's confidence that he can wing it through international summits ought to be in tatters -- given his failure in Finland and the ballyhooed summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore last month, where the President also seemed outmaneuvered.

More likely, Trump will double down and change the subject. When he's in a corner, he fights back. Twitter may catch fire on Tuesday.

What will the West do now?

Trump is supposed to be the leader of the free world. But such men don't kowtow to Russian dictators.

Trump's performance on Monday followed his blitzkrieg through Europe , in which he split the transatlantic alliance, and insulted allied leaders like Germany's Angela Merkel and Britain's Theresa May -- effectively doing Putin's work for him.

The debacle in Finland was exactly what America's friends feared before Trump even left Europe, and it is already beginning to shape their calculations going forward.

"We can no longer completely rely on the White House," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the Funke newspaper group, according to Reuters.

"To maintain our partnership with the USA we must readjust it."

Despite Trump's trolling of US allies over defense spending, the NATO summit last week did take steps to bolster transatlantic defenses and rapid reaction forces. Yet in an alliance built on the principle that an attack on one is an attack on all, the symbolic leadership of the US President is an existential issue. Europe is increasingly nervous.

So it is significant that Maas used the words "White House" rather than the United States -- because it reflects how Europeans are increasingly looking for ways to engage Washington through other centers of power rather than through the capricious President.

Beneath the uproar of Trump's disruptive blast through Europe, strong links remain between the military, business, intelligence agencies and civil society groups on either side of the Atlantic.

Those may be crucial to riding out the Trump storm.

Nicholas Dungan, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who teaches at the prestigious French research university Sciences Po, said it was time for America's friends in Europe and for the US leadership class -- political figures, CEOs, heads of think tanks and universities -- to take action.

"Stop wringing your hands ... get your act together and start doing things that are going to repair the situation, rather than just sitting around and talking about how bad the situation is with Trump," he said.

Dungan argued that America's friends -- like French President Emmanuel Macron, Merkel and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- need to adopt a dual track approach:

"You need two different policies. You need one policy to the individual Donald Trump, because it's clear that he doesn't make the distinction between himself and his office. You need another policy toward the United States of America."

Putin will draw his own conclusions

That searing experience nurtured a fierce grievance against the United States, the victor in the Cold War, and a political career dedicated to the reversal of Moscow's humiliation.

By so comprehensively outpointing the American President in full view of the world -- and the viewers back home on state television in Russia -- Putin engineered a full circle moment.

"Vladimir Putin pitched a shutout. Trump got beat up in the locker room," retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, a former Fox News analyst, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday, calling the US leader a "disgrace" to the country and the presidency.

US intelligence experts said Putin will take one message from Monday's events: that Trump is weak and there is no price to be paid for warping US democracy.

"The President missed a prime opportunity to confront Putin face-to-face and assert with some level of forcefulness that we know that you did this and here's what we are going to do if you don't stop," said Richard Ledgett, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency.

The fear now is that Putin will interpret Trump's solicitous showing in Helsinki as an incentive to come back for more -- to try to manipulate the midterm elections in November, or in 2020 with an updated version of the Russian hacking and interference assault that occurred in 2016.

A choice for GOP, Cabinet members, White House staff

Trump's disaster in Helsinki left everyone who works for him, or supports him, with a choice.

Does it matter that the President refused to stand up for America abroad and chose to align himself with the global political figure who is most hostile to American power, values and historic achievements?

The first officials in the hot seat are the chieftains of the intelligence services, including Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, who was personally repudiated by the President in the news conference. Coats had just said last week that the "warning lights are blinking red again " over possible Russian interference in the midterms.

"We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy," Coats said in a statement after the summit.

But Trump's behavior raises questions about how top intelligence officials can remain in their posts after being so spectacularly thrown under the bus.

After the White House and State Department went dark Monday, unable to explain Trump's performance, senior officials are also likely to engage in fresh soul searching.

Monday's events train new scrutiny on top Republicans, who will come under renewed pressure to rein in their President. But this time, as after every previous outrage, it seems unlikely they will take on the political base that never deserts Trump.

"Today's performance by the President should be a signal to many of those people that it's time to perhaps say publicly what you say privately in the parlors and restaurants of Washington," Larry Pfeiffer, the senior director of the Situation Room in the Obama administration, who also served in the CIA under President George W. Bush, said on CNN.
__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday mocked the #MeToo movement as he repeatedly attacked Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren over her heritage, said Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters had an I.Q. in the "mid-60s," and made thinly-veiled swipes at fellow Republicans John McCain and George H.W. Bush, who are both in ailing health.

Trump held therally in Montana Thursday primarily to inflict political vengeance on Democratic Sen. Jon Tester for his role in sinking the nominee for Secretary of Veterans' Affairs earlier this year.

But the free-wheeling speech largely focused more on a laundry list of Trump's favorite rally topics during another summer campaign event in a state that went heavily for him in 2016.

Trump, who made no mention of the resignation of embattled EPA chief Scott Pruitt hours earlier, also teased his trip to Europe and the forthcoming announcement of his Supreme Court Justice next week.

Trump, in an effort to attack Tester, painted Democrats as the party of open borders and crime.

But his most extended attack was aimed at Warren, a Democrat he has long targeted for claiming that she is part Native American and derisively nicknamed "Pocahontas," after the 17th century historical figure. On Thursday, Trump mocked people who called on him to apologize for the remark and sarcastically apologized to the historic figure.

"I want to apologize. Pocahontas, I apologize to you. I apologize to you. To you I apologize," he said. "To the fake Pocahontas, I won't apologize."

He went on to suggest that, should Warren win the Democratic nomination in 2020 and they were to debate, he would toss an ancestry test to her and dare her to take it. In doing so, he made light of the #MeToo movement.

"We'll take that little kit and say, we have to do it gently because we are in the Me Too generation, and we will very gently take that kit, slowly toss it" to her, Trump said, adding that he would offer $1 million to charity if she took the test and it "shows you are an Indian."

"I have a feeling she will say no," he added.

In a tweet following his speech , Warren said, "Hey, @realDonaldTrump: While you obsess over my genes, your Admin is conducting DNA tests on little kids because you ripped them from their mamas & you are too incompetent to reunite them in time to meet a court order. Maybe you should focus on fixing the lives you're destroying."

Trump's comments on #MeToo come on the heels of his hiring former Fox News executive Bill Shine, who left his role after being accused of mishandling a flurry of sexual harassment allegations within the network. Earlier Thursday on Air Force One, Trump also defended Republican Rep. Jim Jordan against allegations he overlooked sexual abuse during his time as a wrestling coach at Ohio State University.

"I don't believe them at all. I believe him," Trump said.

Warren was far from the only Democrat who drew Trump's acidic rhetoric on Thursday, though. The President continued a long running fight with California Rep. Maxine Waters by slamming her intelligence.

"Democrats want anarchy. They really do. And they don't know who they are playing with, folks," Trump said. "I said it the other day, yes, she is a low IQ individual, Maxine Waters. I said it the other day. I mean, honestly she is somewhere in the mid-60s. I believe that."

Early on in the speech, Trump delivered a sweeping rebuke of Tester, arguing that while the senator tells Montana voters that he stands with the President on certain issues, he doesn't when it matters. Trump excoriated Tester for voting against the Republican health care plan, the Trump-back tax cuts, strict immigration laws and Neil Gorsuch, his first pick for the Supreme Court.

"Jon Tester says one thing when he is in Montana, but I will tell you he does the exact opposite when he goes to Washington," Trump said. "You deserve a senator who doesn't just talk like he is from Montana, you deserve a senator who actually votes like he is from Montana."

But shortly after attacking Tester, he touted his efforts to bring accountability to the Department of Veterans' Affairs an two bills that Tester helped write: the VA MISSION Act and VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act.

Tester, who has run for re-election by pledging to work with Trump when needed, prepared for Trump's visit by taking out full-page ads in 14 of the state's newspapers touting the bills Trump has signed in his first 19 months in office and welcoming him to Montana.

"Welcome to Montana & thank you President Trump for supporting Jon's legislation to help veterans and first responders, hold the VA accountable, and get rid of waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government," reads the ad.

Trump seemingly ignored the outreach, telling supporters that he would rather have people who speak ill of him and vote with him than those who speak highly of him and vote against him.

Trump dedicated considerably more of his campaign rally attacking Tester than he did uplifting Matt Rosendale, his Republican opponent, and he admitted that his beef with the Democrat stems from guilt over Dr. Ronny Jackson's failed nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, not just politics.

Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, led the charge against Jackson, the White House physician who was briefly Trump's pick to lead the embattled agency. Tester's criticism helped lead to Jackson withdrawing his nomination over allegations of misconduct at the White House medical office, angering Trump.

Trump admitted in Great Falls, Montana that he likely traveled to the state because of the fight.

"Jon Tester said things about him that were horrible and that weren't true," Trump said. "That is probably why I am here because I won Montana by so many points, I don't have to come here."

He added: "You know, I feel guilty. I feel guilty. ... I sort of feel guilty for this whole thing."

It was clear during the speech, though, the Trump's eyes were looking even further than 2018.

When he introduced Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines, he noted that he was up for re-election in 2020, adding to cheers that they were going to be "running together."

And in addition to his attacks on Warren, Trump slammed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, all widely considered top candidates for the Democratic nomination in 2020.

But his attacks were not limited to the opposing party, either.

Trump continued to attack, without naming him, Arizona Sen. John McCain -- who is ailing with brain cancer -- for voting against Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The attacks continued despite recent criticism from Meghan McCain, the senator's daughter, and Senator Lindsey Graham, McCain's closest friend in the Senate.

Trump also mocked President George H.W. Bush's slogan during his rally.

"You know all of the rhetoric you see. 'Thousands points of light.' What the hell was that by the way?" Trump said in Montana.

Bush popularized the speech in his 1988 nomination acceptance speech and it was later used to name a foundation.

"Thousand points of light," he said. "What does that mean? I know one thing. Make America Great Again we understand. Putting America first we understand. Thousand points of light, I never quite got that one. What the hell is that? Has anyone ever figured that one out? It was put out by a Republican wasn't it."

Trump also commented on his upcoming trip to Europe where, among other stops, he will meet directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. During the speech, the President slammed reporters and commentators for questioning whether he was preparing for the meeting.

"Trust me, we'll be just fine," he said. "Will I be prepared? Totally prepared. I've been preparing for this stuff my whole life."

Trump used the fact that some were questioning his preparedness to also attack the media.

"Fake news. Bad people," he said, later adding that he and Putin "might even end up having a good relationship."
__label__world (CNN) More than two-thirds of the coral in Australia's Great Barrier Reef is experiencing "shocking" amounts of bleaching, new aerial surveys have revealed.

Back-to-back bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 have devastated a 1,500 km (900 miles) stretch of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Australian scientists told CNN Monday.

Before 2016 there had only been two bleaching events along the Great Barrier Reef in the past two decades, in 1998 and 2002.

This is the first time two have occurred so close together.

"I was surprised to have to be getting in a plane again this year [to survey fresh damage]," Dr James Kerry at James Cook University said..

Last year's bleaching event, the worst on record, mainly affected the north of the reef, while the recent damage has mostly impacted the middle sections, according to scientists at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies.

The bottom third of the reef is now the only section that has escaped significant bleaching.

"The central section of the reef is now displaying the same extent of bleaching as in the north," Kerry said. "Going over those reefs this year, you can tell how low the coral cover was. It was shocking to see the fallout from last year's event."

Damage done by Cyclone Debbie, which struck Queensland in March, has only compounded matters -- the slow-moving storm, which traveled over a 60-mile-wide corridor across the reef, "will have done a lot of damage to the coral," Kerry said.

Climate change 'number one threat'

Coral bleaching is a stress response that happens when an increase in sea temperatures causes the expulsion of algae that grow inside coral, turning the reefs white and eliminating their main energy source. It's directly linked to global warming.

Bleaching doesn't kill coral straight away -- if temperatures drop, the algae has the chance to recolonize. But if temperatures remain high, eventually the coral will die, removing the natural habitat for many species of marine life.

Australia's Minister for the Environment and Energy Josh Frydenberg said in a statement that climate change was the "number one threat" to the Great Barrier Reef.

"That's why the Australian government has launched an unprecedented effort to invest more than A$2 billion ($1.5 billion)... in a Reef 2050 plan, which we're 18 months into," he said.

Kerry explains that a temperature rise of only one or two degrees above the maximum average for up to "three or four weeks" is enough to push corals out of their comfort zone.

"When it's so hot for this extended period of time the corals don't just bleach, they cook and they die very quickly," Kerry added. "My expectation is that has happened, based on what I saw from the air and what I saw last year."

An ecosystem in danger

The Great Barrier Reef is home to the world's largest collection of coral reefs, with around 400 types of coral and 1,500 species of fish. It is also home to a number of endangered species, including the large green turtle and the dugong.

__label__politics (CNN) A prominent Republican senator blasted a Democratic colleague Wednesday who had charged that anyone who supported Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court was "complicit in the evil."

"That's pretty apocalyptic rhetoric," said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking GOP leader in the chamber.

Cornyn was speaking about comments by New Jersey's Democratic Sen. Cory Booker at a Capitol Hill news conference Tuesday, when he warned against confirming Kavanaugh.

"There is so much at stake here. This has nothing to do with politics. This has to do with how we are as moral beings," Booker said. "You are either complicit in the evil. You are either contributing to the wrong or you are fighting against it."

Booker then cited Psalm 23.

__label__politics (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday he accepts the decision by the Rev. Pat Conroy, the House chaplain, to rescind his resignation, following a week's worth of lawmakers from both parties questioning Ryan's request that Conroy step down.

"I have accepted Father Conroy's letter and decided that he will remain in his position as chaplain of the House," Ryan said in a statement. "My original decision was made in what I believed to be in the best interest of this institution. To be clear, that decision was based on my duty to ensure that the House has the kind of pastoral services that it deserves."

Ryan added, "It is my job as speaker to do what is best for the body, and I know that this body is not well-served by a protracted fight over such an important post. I intend to sit down with Father Conroy early next week so that we can move forward for the good of the whole House."

Conroy sent his intentions in a letter to Ryan earlier Thursday.

"At this time, and upon advice of counsel, I herby retract and rescind said resignation for the reasons that follow," Conroy wrote in the letter dated Thursday and addressed to Ryan.

__label__politics (CNN) Weeks after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to bring families separated at the border back together, a Salvadoran woman has filed a federal lawsuit in Washington asking to be reunited with her infant daughter who needs to be breastfed.

Leydi Duenas-Claros also seeks a halt to her deportation proceedings and wants the government to reconsider her denied asylum claim.

"We are waiting to go before a judge and will be able to comment more at a later time," said Claudia O'Brien, an attorney for Duenas.

Duenas was set to be deported on Thursday, but O'Brien was told the proceedings were postponed.

In May, Duenas, 30, came to the United States with her then-11-month-old daughter, one of her five children who by birth are US citizens, to seek asylum, the lawsuit says. They were separated after she and her child crossed the border.

__label__politics (CNN) EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's 24-hour security in Washington extends to at least some of his personal trips, according to a letter Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse sent to the department's inspector general and shared with CNN.

The letter, written based on information that Whitehouse says he confidentially obtained from an unnamed source, raises new questions about the cost of Pruitt's unprecedented EPA-funded security, and alleges that Pruitt has used his security detail while on non-official business, including trips home to Tulsa, Oklahoma, a family vacation to Disneyland and the Rose Bowl game.

Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, says the new details should be added to the inspector general's ongoing investigation into Pruitt's travel expenses and use of a 24/7 security detail. The documents, he wrote, raise concern "significant agency resources are being devoted to administrator Pruitt's 'round-the-clock security, even when he is traveling on non-official business."

Whitehouse adds, "While I consider matters of personal security to be extremely serious, personal security should never be used as a pretext to obtain special treatment."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) US Cyber Command chief Adm. Mike Rogers told lawmakers on Tuesday that he has not been granted the authority by President Donald Trump to disrupt Russian election hacking operations where they originate.

Asked by Democratic Sen. Jack Reed if he has been directed by the President, through the defense secretary, to confront Russian cyber operators at the source, Rogers said "no I have not" but noted that he has tried to work within the authority he maintains as a commander.

While he did not agree with Reed's characterization that the US has been "sitting back and waiting," Rogers admitted that it is fair to say that "we have not opted to engage in some of the same behaviors we are seeing" with regards to Russia.

"It has not changed the calculus or the behavior on behalf of the Russians," Rogers said about the US response to Russia's cyber threat to date.

"They have not paid a price that is sufficient to change their behavior," he added.

(CNN) There is a certain mindset in politics, present the world over and across the political spectrum, which distrusts expertise. That mindset is presently revealing itself in Australia, where this week a small group of conservative-minded members of parliament held the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hostage over climate policy .

Turnbull's center-right Liberal party had pledged to reduce emissions from Australia's energy companies more than a quarter (from 2005 levels) by 2030, a key part of its efforts to meet its international obligations.

But several of his own MPs, led by his predecessor as prime minister and long-term rival Tony Abbott, forced him into a climbdown by threatening to vote against the legislation. Turnbull's government barely has a majority in the House of Representatives, and losing such a key vote could have led to a leadership challenge. Cowed, he dropped the pledge, and on Tuesday narrowly survived the revolt.

Internal Liberal party politics are one thing. But the symbolism of the gesture is telling. Australia is a country where environmental damage is obvious, in the form of the hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic caused by use of CFCs decades ago, the steady bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef from warming, carbon-dioxide-acidified seas, and the ever more prevalent bushfires.

Yet for large parts of the political class here, and the people who vote for them, climate change is seen as a scam perpetrated by liberal, anti-business scientists.

One in five Australians, a poll last year showed, believe that climate change is a "hoax." Another poll in 2015 declared that Australia was the most climate-skeptical nation on Earth.

Abbott himself has said that the "settled science" of climate change is " absolute crap " and that efforts to reduce its impact are like "killing goats to appease the volcano gods." Another politician, the anti-immigration populist Malcolm Roberts, has clashed with scientist Brian Cox, claiming that NASA data was "manipulated" to make climate change appear worse than it was, to Cox's astonishment.

For the record, climate change is not a hoax. There is some debate over how extreme the warming will be, but the warming so far has been within predicted levels. NASA has not been falsifying data. This is conspiratorial, anti-scientific nonsense.

But anti-scientific nonsense is extremely appealing at the populist fringes of politics. In the US, President Donald Trump has also called climate change a hoax, perpetrated by the Chinese , and has been filling the Environmental Protection Agency with climate skeptics, including former chief Scott Pruitt, now resigned amid multiple ethics scandals

Trump is also anti-vaccine, associating with Andrew Wakefield, the disgraced, fraudulent British doctor behind the discredited research linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism, and weirdly claiming that multi-vaccine injections are bad because " tiny children are not horses ."

JUST WATCHED Trump tweets climate change could be 'good' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump tweets climate change could be 'good' 02:07

British politics has its own share of climate skeptics and anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists, especially on the UKIP-led hard right. And the left is not innocent -- the left-wing populist leader of the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, once signed a parliamentary motion supporting the pseudoscientific alternative medicine homeopathy, tweeting that it "works for some people ." The Green Party is resolutely anti-nuclear and anti-genetically modified organisms.

What all these positions have in common is a distrust of what "the experts" are saying -- the relevant scientists who are almost uniformly convinced that climate change is real, human-made and dangerous; that vaccines are safe and highly effective; that homeopathy is ineffective, and that nuclear power and GMOs are important tools for powering and feeding the world.

Populism offers simple, intuitive alternatives to complex, messy reality. For example, immigrants or the EU are behind all your problems ; get rid of them and it'll all be OK. That makes populism almost directly opposed to science.

Scientific truths are complex. Understanding how an invisible, harmless gas can trap heat in the atmosphere because of its molecular shape is not easy. The claim that if a child gets ill shortly after being vaccinated, that doesn't mean the vaccine caused the illness, is counter-intuitive, as is -- conversely -- saying that just because someone gets better after taking homeopathy, that doesn't mean the homeopathy made them better.

Science deals in uncertainty, and in often counter-intuitive fact.

"Climate change is not dangerous; it's a liberal hoax" is a more reassuring message than "climate change is real and going to make things much worse." It's also easier to understand. The only drawback is that it's false.

The public may have had enough of experts, but as the winter bushfires in Australia show, that doesn't mean the experts are wrong.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) As a court-ordered deadline to reunite all eligible families the Trump administration separated at the border elapsed, one in three children still remained away from their parents, with no clear indication when they would be reunited.

According to a court filing, the government has reunited 1,442 families with children aged 5 and older by late Thursday. The government says an additional 378 children have already been released under "appropriate circumstances," according to the court filing. That includes children released to another family member or friend who can care for them, children who were released to parents already out of government custody and those who have turned 18.

But there are more than 700 children still left in government custody, unable to be reunited with their parents any time soon. The government maintains that it could not or should not have reunited all of those children, including hundreds of parents who were apparently deported and others who the government says declined to be reunified or have criminal histories.

In an update Friday morning, a DHS spokesperson issued a statement that the government had completed one of its tasks -- reuniting all parents who had still been in government custody and were deemed eligible in time with their children.

The spokesperson provided no new numbers from Thursday, and it's not clear how many additional reunifications have taken place. The statement also noted some parents "are not eligible or available for reunification" Friday, including the hundreds who are no longer in the country, some who were released in the US and haven't yet been located, or those the government declared it had safety concerns about.

__label__politics Brian Balogh is professor of history at the University of Virginia and is co-host of the podcast " Backstory ." He has been affiliated with the Miller Center for almost 20 years, and resigned from the Dorothy Compton chair there on June 30, before he had any knowledge of Marc Short's appointment. The views expressed are his own. Read more opinions at CNN.

(CNN) Ever since he announced his run for the presidency, Donald Trump has mounted a growing, unprecedented attack on civil debate, tolerance, respect for minorities and foreigners, fact-based discourse, the rule of law and other attributes of America's cherished liberal democracy. His opponents have been counting on the political system to stop this runaway train, to no avail.

First, they assumed that candidate Trump would implode. Then, they counted on any one of a dozen-plus established Republican candidates to win the GOP nomination. Next it was Hillary Clinton's turn to beat Trump. Once Trump was elected, the folks who were supposed to rein Trump in ranged from the "adults in the room," to Congress, to some of Trump's own appointees in the Department of Justice and the national security establishment. To date, however, all of these "checks and balances" have largely failed to constrain a President who will do anything for a personal win, even if it means changing the rules by which the political game is played.

Untested until recently as a guardrail against Trump is the academy. Admittedly, modern-day universities are not known for their courage in this area. As Dahlia Lithwick put it in a recent article for Slate, "A good many academics to whom I have spoken in recent months have told me their best hope is to keep to themselves, work in their limited fields, be good teachers and scholars, and count on something larger than themselves to change things in government."

Yet what better institution than a university to stand up to the President in the name of civil discourse, evidence-based discovery and the crucial role of disciplined expertise? That is why the recent effort to stop the appointment of Trump's former legislative director Marc Short at the University of Virginia's Miller Center is so promising, even though it has not yet succeeded.

More than 3,200 members of the University of Virginia community have signed a petition asking the Miller Center to rescind its offer. Two prominent historians, Melvyn P. Leffler, former dean of the university's College of Arts and Sciences and a prize-winning historian, and William I. Hitchcock, a leading student of foreign affairs and the presidency, resigned from the Miller Center in protest over the university's decision.

It is easy to see why the Miller Center might be interested in Short. The Miller Center is a nonpartisan think tank that specializes in the study of the US presidency. Short, who began his career working on the Senate campaign of Oliver North, the current president of the National Rifle Association, and was chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence, has been one of Trump's top aides. Short certainly has seen conservative politics and the current administration from the inside.

While scholars studying the presidency at the Miller Center need to talk to political operatives such as Short -- indeed, one of the Miller Center's most important programs, the Presidential Oral History Program, does just that by interviewing dozens of officials from presidential administrations -- it should not offer high-level positions to those who do not embrace the fundamental values shared by the academy and liberal democracies. Nor should it help launder the reputation of aides who have enabled the President to, in the words of Hitchcock and Leffler, "disregard, circumvent, and even violate the norms and laws that are fundamental to civil discourse and democratic politics."

In short, institutions such as the Miller Center, and universities more generally have an opportunity to double down on the values they most cherish by rejecting those who have sought to erode such values.

The process that led to Short's appointment also excluded vital input from faculty at the Miller Center. As the historians who resigned put it in their letter to center Director Bill Antholis, "Your decision was made without adequate faculty discussion, deliberation and a vote." This is standard practice at universities, and the reason for it simple: It falls to the faculty to ensure that universities are not tempted to stray from their central mission in search of financial or political gain. It is also the faculty's role to ensure that only the most highly qualified scholars join their ranks. Short has none of those scholarly qualifications.

JUST WATCHED Trump rewrites history on Charlottesville Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump rewrites history on Charlottesville 03:52

Had the leadership of the Miller Center consulted its faculty, it would have learned that the timing of this appointment was terrible. The university is approaching the anniversary of the tragic events that wracked the Charlottesville community on August 11-12 of last year, yet Short did not distance himself from Trump's racist comments in the wake of the Unite the Right rally and the tragic death of a peaceful counterprotester, Heather Heyer

Although Short has recently stated that he is "sympathetic to the pain in the community" and that "I think we could have done a better job expressing sympathy for the victims and outrage at those who perpetrated this evil," he failed to call out the President at the time or show any intellectual independence from his boss -- a quality that the academy, if it wishes to live up to its ideals, must demand.

Short moves into his Miller Center office this week. So why do the resignation of two professors and the signatures of several thousand people suggest a promising path forward? Because these protesters have articulated the fundamental values that should inform all universities, and those values, in turn, are precisely what Trump is undermining.

Those who defend the hire have invoked bipartisanship and nonpartisanship, saying we need to hire some conservatives to balance the progressives among our senior fellows. That misses the nature of the threat faced by the United States today. The norms and practices that have allowed liberal democracy to thrive in this nation are under assault. The battle lines must be drawn between the advocates of liberalism and the forces of illiberalism. That formulation comes from none other than Miller Center assistant professor Nicole Hemmer , not from a political operative for either party.

Which is why universities are ideally positioned to defend the values that undergird liberal democracy. But they must do so by hiring faculty who subscribe to these values, and who are highly trained in their specialized field, not partisan warriors.

If these values are not the flavor of the month in Washington, they do continue to inspire Americans in many walks of life. Because the academy has so much to lose should its members fail to act on these values, it is just possible that today's version of Army attorney Joseph Welch, who asked Joe McCarthy, "Have you no sense of decency, sir?" reads something like the last paragraph of the Hitchcock/Leffler letter

"As teachers, we have often told our students that the defense of democracy and its basic ideals -- respect for truth, inquiry, reason, decency, civility, and humanity -- requires constant vigilance and active engagement. We must not normalize or rationalize hateful, cruel and demeaning behavior. We should not reward and honor those who defend such behavior. When we see things we believe to be wrong, we must speak out and take a stand."

Marc Short did not stand up for these values while he enabled Trump to systematically assault them from the White House. Nor did the Miller Center stand up for these values when it appointed Short without consulting its faculty. But for thousands of students, alumni, faculty and yes, university presidents too, a golden opportunity to do the right thing awaits.
__label__world Taung Byone, Myanmar (CNN) Gyrating dancers passed through the crowds, bowing to men in silk dresses with orchids in their hair, as the normally sleepy village of Taung Byone marked the start of the annual Spirit Festival with a flamboyant opening ceremony.

Every summer, this part of central Myanmar hosts the cross between a traditional religious gathering and gay pride festival, which has become a key event for the LGBT community in a country where those who do not conform to traditional gender ideas are often shunned and "homosexual acts" remain illegal.

This year, as many as 5,000 people from across Myanmar traveled to the festival, many drawn by the promise of meeting with the event's famed Nat Kadaws, mediums whose name translates as "spirit wives."

Nat Kadaws are believed by their followers to communicate with spirits on behalf of worshippers, transmitting their wishes and questions to spirits, before relaying the spirit's guidance or advice to believers, to solve their problem. Nat Kadaws also perform dances to celebrate the spirits and spread luck, usually in elaborate costumes and makeup.

Nat Kadaw U Win Hlaing has performed in multiple countries around the world and is high demand during the Spirit Festival.

"People might have different difficulties, such as physiological needs, like food, clothes and shelter, their business, or relationships," one of Myanmar's most eminent spirit mediums, U Win Hlaing, told CNN. "I discuss with supernatural beings how to solve their problems."

The medium -- who has performed in nine countries including Thailand, Singapore, France and Japan -- is a superstar among "Nat," or spirit, believers.

Hlaing has more than 100 assistants, including a masseuse, security guards and cooks, who prepare food for both Hlaing and fans, as well as the medium's ever-full red wine dispenser.

Hlaing has also earned an award from the government, for a $300,000 donation and other contributions to Buddhism.

Addressed by both the female honorific "Daw" and the male "Ko," Hlaing said "I had the feeling I was different from other kids, growing up."

Hlaing is one of many outsiders who have found a home at the Spirit Festival. "Culturally, it is a long-time tradition that straight and gay people come together at this festival," Hlaing said. "It's not just for gays, it's for everyone."

Spirit Wives, Hlaing added, "can be male or female, gay or straight," adding "as long as they are professional, their gender identity does not matter," after expertly applying a double set of false lashes.

For Myanmar's LGBT community however, the festival has become an annual haven, in a country where a colonial era law -- section 377 of the penal code -- still bans homosexual acts.

'My parents beat me'

While not widely enforced, LGBT people in Myanmar face a greater frequency of arrests, as well as other discrimination, and many suffer domestic abuse, according to Colors Rainbow, an NGO dedicated to advancing LGBT rights in Myanmar.

Chit Ya Aung -- the 30-year-old's name means "let's love" in English -- knows this only too well. "I felt like I was a girl since I was born," she said. "My parents beat me for being girly."

Raised as a boy, but identifying as female, Aung left home and joined the Nat Kadaws at 14, eventually meeting the man she now regards as her husband at a Spirit Festival eight years ago.

"I am a dancer, he is a drummer. After meeting several times, and making eye contact, it felt like there was something special," she said.

Aung's family came around to both her identity and her relationship, recently calling her home for a reunion and welcoming her husband.

Despite identifying as a woman, Aung describes herself as gay, rather than transgender -- a less common identity in Myanmar due partially to the lack of access to gender confirmation surgery in the country. Only those who can afford to are able to get the expensive procedures, mostly performed in neighboring Thailand.

Social prejudice against transgender people also add to the challenges they face, on top of those experienced by other members of the LGBT community in Myanmar.

"Once they identify themselves as trans people, it is the hardest part," said Hla Myat Htun, deputy director of Colors Rainbow.

"If you are (a) gay guy or lesbian woman, and you are ... not really expressing yourself in the workplace, you are fine," he said.

Those who outwardly express a noncomformist identity face "a lot of discrimination, or different kinds of mistreatment," Htun added, particularly from colleagues or supervisors.

As Myanmar's economy continues to open up, attitudes to its LGBT community are continuing to change. More than 250 local companies have signed up to the UN Global Compact, which includes adhering to global human rights standards. This does not apply to many local firms, however, said Htun.

"I found it very hard to get a job, so I run my own business as a beautician," said 40-year old The The Darli, who sports long hair and smoky eyes.

Darli -- addressed as "brother or sister" -- made a 20 hour-car journey from the Ayerwaddy Delta for the last ten festivals, with limited funds.

'Now nobody says anything'

While many openly gay, lesbian and transgender people in Myanmar struggle to find work, spiritual problem-solving can be a lucrative business, with some Nat Kadaws earning up to $7,000 in four days.

"In their whole life, when they are young... they were looked down on because of their identity," said Htun. As Nat Kadaws though, "they are worshiped" without discrimination and stigma.

And in contrast to the past, with senior Nat Kadaws guarding their identities even at the Spirit Festival, many younger fans and apprentices are openly gay.

"I want to dance more at Nat festivals, because I love to dance," said 25-year old Pyae Pyae. He said life for gay men in Myanmar is getting easier year by year, touching a bright pink ruby band on his ring finger.

"We didn't get married, but we lived together secretly," he said. "Now nobody says anything, and we can stay at both parents' homes."

While Pyae's father was a maritime pilot, and his mother wanted him to become one too, he insisted on pursuing the Nat Kadaw path, beginning as a dancer, a move which initially cost his parents' support for him going to college.

"Now my parents surrendered," he said. "Whatever I dig, I dig."

Mediums spin around in a frenzy of red and gold while glugging from a bottle of whiskey, part of an age old ritual to honour Myanmar's spirit guardian of drunkards and gamblers.

Fight goes on

Back at Hlaing's temporary compound, two younger men hurriedly laid out Hlaing's array of lipsticks, the final touch of makeup for the opening ceremony. Hlaing opted for mauve.

After an hour of beautifying, the medium was ready for the thousands of heaving fans waiting in the packed temple. Screams worthy of a rock star erupted as Hlaing entered, with festival-goers clamoring over one another and punch-ups erupting between those vying to get near him.

Hlaing danced for the spirits, before blessing thick wads of bank notes worth roughly 40 cents each and tossing them into the frenzied, sweating crowd.

The show was spectacular. But for Myanmar's LGBT community -- swinging between widespread discrimination and occasional celebration -- when the music stops, the fight for everyday equality, dignity and respect goes on.
__label__politics Aspen, Colorado (CNN) The goal of China's influence operations around the world is to replace the United States as the world's leading superpower, the CIA's Michael Collins said Friday.

Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum during a session on the rise of China, Collins, the deputy assistant director of the CIA's East Asia Mission Center, said Chinese President Xi Jinping and his regime are waging a "cold war" against the US.

"By their own terms and what Xi enunciates I would argue by definition what they're waging against us is fundamentally a cold war, a cold war not like we saw during the Cold War, but a cold war by definition. A country that exploits all avenues of power licit and illicit, public and private, economic and military, to undermine the standing of your rival relative to your own standing without resorting to conflict. The Chinese do not want conflict," Collins said.

"At the end of the day they want every country around the world, when it's deciding its interests on policy issues, to first and foremost side with China and not the United States, because the Chinese are increasingly defining a conflict with the United States and what we stand behind as a systems conflict."

By looking at the writings of Xi, whose "thought" or world view was recently enshrined in China's constitution, it's clear, Collins says, that the threat China presents is the greatest global challenge the US currently faces.

"It sets up a competition with us and what we stand behind far more significantly by any extreme than what the Russians could put forward," Collins said.

Collins' comments on the third day of the forum echoed those of other senior US officials there, including FBI Director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, who both pointed to China as the most significant danger for the US today.

"I think China, from a counterintelligence perspective, in many ways represents the broadest, most challenging, most significant threat we face as a country," Wray had told his audience on Wednesday.

"And I say that because for them it is a whole of state effort. It is economic espionage as well as traditional espionage; it is nontraditional collectors as well as traditional intelligence operatives; it's human sources as well as cyber means."

Coats said Thursday that the US needed to decide if China was a "true adversary or a legitimate competitor." He criticized Chinese state efforts to steal business secrets and academic research. "I think that's where we begin to draw the line," he said.

China's growing defense posture

Marcel Lettre, a former undersecretary of defense for intelligence, said that influence operations -- in which the ruling Communist Party uses political, financial and military strategies to establish and solidify its presence in countries in its region and beyond -- were only one tool China deploys as part of a larger effort to expand and grow.

"It's a country that has the second largest global defense budget, the largest standing army of ground forces, the third largest air force in the world, a navy of 300 ships -- including more than 60 subs -- all of this is in the process of being modernized and upgraded," he said, adding that those upgrades were "oriented around the innovations we've been taking on the US side for the last decade or two."

enhance China's military power in the region, experts said it was still outdated and lagged far behind the standard of American aircraft carriers. China unveiled its first homegrown carrier, a 50,000-ton ship , in May. The carrier's maiden sea trial followed a speech by Xi on April 12 in which he announced plans to build a "world-class" navy under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party. While the new carrier willenhance China's military power in the region, experts said it was still outdated and lagged far behind the standard of American aircraft carriers.

At the same time, China has established ports along the Indian Ocean that extend to Djibouti, where last year it dispatched two warships carrying an undisclosed number of troops to its first overseas military base.

Susan Thornton, who serves as the acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, pointed to the impasse in the South China Sea as an area where the US presence might press Beijing to negotiate with other nations in the region that claim territory in the disputed waters.

In recent years, the Chinese government has built a number of artificial islands in the South China Sea with military installations, including radar facilities and airstrips. Beijing asserts that much of the South China Sea is its sovereign territory, claims most of the internationally community view as spurious.

"Will China be bound by rules and will it negotiate with ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) multilateral partners or will it try to pick off one by one each individual and get more leverage that way?" she asked.

Thornton, who was initially President Donald Trump's nominee for the assistant secretary position, resigned in June when she was notified she was no longer his choice . She told Friday's audience that her service would conclude at the end of the panel discussion.

'Our soft power is ... more powerful than their soft power'

Part of Trump's new national security strategy announced in December includes moves to combat China on the technological and cyber fronts, but also to work with partners around the world to contest Chinese practices and persuade Beijing to agree to international conventions and standards.

While much of the world's attention has been focused on crises including the terror attacks of 9/11, the Chinese have maintained a singular focus for years.

"They are learning to be more coercive, learning to be more aspirational, learning to be more assertive by what they're getting away with," said the CIA's Collins. "9/11 is one example where the international community had to shift its attention to something else and the Chinese drove through that decade to especially expand where they are, so it's a long way of saying that there are things that happened in the international system, things that ... helped to explain to some degree the speed and expanse of where the Chinese have gotten to where they are today."

Both Thornton and Collins pointed to events over the past decade to partly explain China's rapid expansion and growth.

"The Chinese are very good at taking advantage of opportunities, which they may have been able to do in the recent past with our focus on the Middle East for the first part of the 2000s and following that the financial crisis," Thornton said. "We have to get back to doing what we do well. Our soft power is incredibly more powerful than their soft power. They don't really have that same kind of attractiveness that the US system has, and I think that's because our partners around the world know we stand by them and know we won't impose our will on them, that we'll work together with them."

Collins said that even China's partners would not want to subscribe to the country's way of life.

"I too am optimistic that in the battle for norms and rules and standards of behavior, that the liberal national order is stronger than the repressive standards that the Chinese promulgate," he said. "I'm confident others won't want to subscribe to that."
__label__politics Story highlights Cruz at CNN town hall: Trump ally planted affairs story with friendly publisher

Earlier in the day, Amanda Carpenter denounced "sexist smears" suggesting she had an affair with Cruz

Washington (CNN) Ted Cruz on Tuesday night accused Donald Trump's allies of conspiring to publish a National Enquirer story alleging the Texas senator had multiple affairs with unnamed women.

Cruz suggested that Roger Stone, a former aide to Trump, and David Pecker, CEO of the National Enquirer's parent company, had been in cahoots, pushing an item he has repeatedly denied and denounced as "garbage."

"The story, on its face, quoted one person on the record: Roger Stone," Cruz said during a CNN town hall event in Wisconsin. "Roger Stone has been Donald Trump's chief political adviser. He planned and ran his presidential campaign and he's been his hatchet man -- he's spent 40 years as a hatchet man. But not only that, the head of the National Enquirer, a guy named David Pecker, is good friends with Donald Trump."

1. Venezuela attack

Six people have been arrested in connection with what Venezuelan officials call an assassination attempt on President Nicolas Maduro. The attack happened over the weekend as Maduro was giving a speech during a military parade. A pair of drones loaded with explosives flew right toward him. Live footage of the event showed Maduro suddenly looking up startled midspeech, while beside him his wife, Cilia Flores, winced after a loud bang and dozens of soldiers were seen scattering. Authorities were able to knock the drones off course and caused them to detonate away from Maduro.

Appearing on TV a few hours later, Maduro blamed the attack on the far right in Venezuela and Colombia, outgoing Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and Venezuelans living in the US. Venezuela has been gripped in chaos for a while now, with food and medicine shortages, soaring prices, political instability and violence causing thousands to flee the South American nation.

Did President Trump admit in a tweet that the 2016 Trump Tower meeting was never about Russian adoptions, as Team Trump has always maintained, and instead was just about getting dirt on Hillary Clinton? It seems so. The President was tweeting out his displeasure with reports that he's worried about son Donald Trump Jr.'s legal exposure in the Russia investigation. (He says he's not worried.) Then he wrote that the purpose of that meeting was "to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics." That pretty much contradicts everything the President and his team have previously said. CNN's Chris Cillizza says Trump is "twisting himself in knots" trying to explain the Trump Tower meeting.

Is the NRA in danger of shutting down? The influential gun advocacy organization claims it is -- if the state of New York keeps it from doing business with financial companies. In a lawsuit filed in May and amended in July, the NRA accuses New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo of trying to stop banks and insurers from dealing with the gun rights group. The NRA says it will have to close its headquarters, shutter its internet presence and stop holding rallies if this doesn't stop. Cuomo said the state won't be "intimidated by the NRA's frivolous lawsuit to advance its dangerous gun-peddling agenda." New York has filed a motion to dismiss the case, and a hearing is scheduled for next month.

__label__politics (CNN) Federal authorities had cornered the man they suspected could be part of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election -- and they might have been more successful in their investigation in early 2017 if it had not been for George Papadopoulos, the special counsel alleged on Friday.

Special counsel prosecutors are asking a judge to sentence Papadopoulos to up to six months in prison, according to a court filing on Friday. The former Trump campaign staffer pleaded guilty last October to one count of lying to investigators over his interactions about the Trump campaign with foreign contacts who had connections to Russia.

Papadopoulos lied to the FBI in January 2017 about his contact in London with Joseph Mifsud, identified in the filing as "the Professor." Mifsud had told Papadopoulos the Russians had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton. Federal authorities then found Mifsud in DC two weeks later, but allowed him to leave the country.

"The defendant's lies undermined investigators' ability to challenge the Professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States," prosecutors wrote. "The defendant's false statements were intended to harm the investigation, and did so."

Mifsud was not named in the court filing Friday night, but CNN learned the name of the mysterious "Professor" after Papadopoulos' guilty plea became public last year. Mifsud, who "has not returned to the United States" since February 2017, has not been publicly charged with a crime.

Papadopoulos' initial interview with federal investigators in late January 2017 was months before the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller's team said in their Friday filing that that early interview, part of a national security investigation, was "completely voluntary." Papadopoulos went with the agents from his home to the FBI office in Chicago to be interviewed for more than two hours, the filing said.

At the time of the interview, the FBI agents were looking for people with information about the Trump campaign and its connections to Russia. They were also pursuing leads about Russia's involvement in the US presidential election almost three months before the interview, the filing said. They reminded Papadopoulos several times in that interview that he should not lie and could be prosecuted if he did, the filing said.

Papadopoulos lied "to minimize both his own role as a witness and the extent of the campaign's knowledge of his contacts," the prosecutors said.

Among "at least a dozen" lies at the interview, Papadopoulos concealed the "significance" of when he had learned that Russians possessed thousands of emails about Clinton. Papadopoulos said wrongly several times he had communicated with Mifsud before he joined the Trump campaign.

But Papadopoulos knew he had a role in the campaign when he started conversing with Mifsud in March 2016 -- and the professor "showed interest in the defendant only after learning of his role on the campaign," the filing said. Papadopoulos learned about the "dirt" the Russians had on Clinton the following month, after he began working for Trump, the filing said. He told the authorities his interactions with Mifsud were "a very strange coincidence."

On the same day as his interview, Papadopoulos applied for a deputy assistant secretary position in Trump's Department of Energy, according to the filing.

"The defendant lied in order to conceal his contacts with Russians and Russian intermediaries during the campaign," the filing said.

Those lies happened "early in the investigation, when key investigative decisions, including who to interview and when, were being made," it said.

Several Russians involved in the hacking of Clinton and Democratic email servers were criminally charged by Mueller's team about a month ago.

"Had the defendant told the FBI the truth when he was interviewed in January 2017, the FBI could have quickly taken numerous investigative steps to help determine, for example, how and where the Professor obtained the information, why the Professor provided the information to the defendant, and what the defendant did with the information after receiving it," the filing said.

To make matters worse for Papadopoulos, the prosecutors say he has not provided significant help in their investigation. The former Trump campaign foreign policy aide provided investigators with information only after they confronted him with text messages, internet searches and other information they had collected, the filing said.

Papadopoulos met with prosecutors four times to offer information after his initial interview and before he was charged with lying, the filing says. It was only at the fourth meeting, accompanied by his lawyers, that he told them about a cellphone he had used abroad during the campaign that had logged his calls with Mifsud.

An additional meeting in December where investigators wanted to ask Papadopoulos more questions -- two months after he cut his plea deal -- was canceled because he and his then-fiancée began giving interviews to media outlets.

After Friday's filing, Papadopoulos' wife, Simona Mangiante, told CNN she felt her husband should pull out of the plea agreement, saying he hadn't had proper representation in the negotiation with the government. It was not clear if that was her husband's belief as well.

Prosecutors said in the filing that Mangiante, in interviews with the media, had inflated Papadopoulos' help to investigators following his plea.

Papadopoulos' lawyer Thomas Breen said Friday night that he was unable to comment at this time and would respond through the court record in their own pre-sentencing memo, which must be filed by Aug. 31.

In another curious detail in the filing, the special counsel team said Papadopoulos had been given $10,000 in cash "from a foreign national whom he believed was likely an intelligence officer of a foreign country." The filing noted that the country was "other than Russia."

Mueller has also recommended a $9,500 fine.

Papadopoulos is scheduled to be sentenced in the US District Court for the District of Columbia on Sept. 7.

Another defendant, Alex van der Zwaan, also pleaded guilty to lying to investigators. He received 30 days in prison.

__label__politics Dallas (CNN) For most of their annual meeting this week in Dallas, Southern Baptists have talked about spiritual matters, particularly their keen focus on gaining new converts.

But the gathering of the nation's largest evangelical group took a political turn on Wednesday morning, when Vice President Mike Pence addressed the nearly 10,000 delegates, known as messengers. And some weren't happy about it.

"I know that sent a terribly mixed signal," tweeted J.D. Greear, a North Carolina pastor who was elected to be the denomination's new president on Tuesday.

"We are grateful for civic leaders who want to speak to our convention -- but make no mistake about it, our identity is in the Gospel and our unity is in the Great Commission." The Great Commission is Jesus' call in the Bible for Christians to "go and make disciples of all nations."

In introducing Pence, Steve Gaines, the outgoing president of the Southern Baptist Convention, as the denomination is officially known, noted the Vice President is a conservative Christian who "loves the Lord Jesus Christ." Gaines said he appreciated Pence's appearance last November at a memorial service for the victims of a mass shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.

__label__politics (CNN) Three companies say they will no longer donate to America First Policies, a nonprofit group that works to promote President Donald Trump's agenda, after CNN and other outlets reported racist comments made by staffers of the organization.

MapLight, a nonpartisan research group that tracks the influence of money in politics, reported on Thursday that three companies -- CVS Health, Southern Company, and Dow Chemical -- have donated a combined $1.6 million to America First Policies.

In a statement to CNN, Carolyn Castel, a spokesperson for CVS Health said, "Comments made by employees of America First Policies that were reported after we made our contributions are unacceptable to us. We have zero tolerance for discriminatory actions or behaviors, and as such we will not be making contributions to this organization in the future."

Castel went on to say that CVS Health contributes to organizations across the political spectrum and that its contributions to America First were made in support of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

CVS Health said the $500,000 donation came before it was aware of comments by America First Policies' director of advocacy, Carl Higbie and others.

Kennedy added, "I don't see why he would need a security clearance, I really don't."

Sen. Richard Shelby on Wednesday similarly downplayed the President's decision and questioned why former high-ranking officials would maintain security clearances once they have left government service.

"When I leave here, I'll be a private citizen. I won't be a US senator. So I don't see anything wrong with that. I don't know why they give them security clearances anyway other than maybe a transition period ... but not in perpetuity," the Alabama Republican told CNN.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Former US attorney Preet Bharara said Sunday that it "would be outrageous" for a sitting president to pardon himself, which President Donald Trump's lawyers appear to argue in a letter sent to special counsel Robert Mueller.

"I think (if) the President decided he was going to pardon himself, I think that's almost self-executing impeachment," Bharara, a CNN legal analyst, said on CNN's "State of the Union." "Whether or not there is a minor legal argument that some law professor somewhere in a legal journal can make that the President can pardon, that's not what the framers could have intended. That's not what the American people, I think, would be able to stand for."

The comments come after The New York Times published a 20-page letter to special counsel Robert Mueller by Trump attorney Jay Sekulow and then-Trump lawyer John Dowd. They argue that the President could not possibly have committed obstruction in the Russia investigation because the Constitution empowers him to "terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired."

Asked about the letter, Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani said on Sunday that the President is not going to pardon himself but "probably does" have the power to do it.

"He has no intention of pardoning himself," Giuliani told ABC's "This Week." He added, "It would be an open question. I think it would probably get answered by gosh, that's what the Constitution says, and if you want to change it, change it. But yes."

__label__politics "Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, claims that then-candidate Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer his campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton, sources with knowledge tell CNN. Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller, the sources said."

Holy crap.

Let's take a quick step back for some context. The June 2016 meeting between a group of Russians and the top brass of the Trump campaign, including the candidate's eldest son and son-in-law, has long been at the center of questions -- from special counsel Robert Mueller and others -- about whether there was any sort of collusion between a foreign country and the Trump campaign in 2016. When news of the meeting first broke, Donald Trump Jr. insisted it was a brief and unimportant gathering focused on an obscure adoption law that the Russians wanted changed.

But as the story came into closer focus, it became clear that the genesis of the meeting was a promise on behalf of the Russians, by a go-between named Rob Goldstone, that they had dirt on Hillary Clinton that they wanted to pass along to the Trump brain trust. "Seems we have some time and if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer," Trump Jr. wrote in an email to Goldstone about the promised dirt.

We also later learned that Trump himself had been involved in the crafting of his son's initial statement to the media about the meeting, a revelation that contradicted past claims that he was uninvolved. In June, The New York Times revealed that not only had the President known about the statement, but that he had dictated himself.

Which brings us to this allegation regarding when Trump knew -- and if he knew -- about the Trump Tower meeting before it happened.

Trump himself has been absolutely conclusive that he did not have any foreknowledge of the meeting. "No, I didn't know anything about the meeting," he told The New York Times during an interview in July 2017 . "It must have been a very important -- must have been a very unimportant meeting. ... No, nobody told me. I didn't know noth-- It's a very unimportant -- sounded like a very unimportant meeting. Because I never even heard about it."

He doubled down on that position Friday morning: "I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary's lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!"

Trump Jr. said much the same during a behind-closed-doors meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "No, I wouldn't have wasted his time with it," Trump Jr. said when asked whether his father knew about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting in advance. (The testimony was released publicly.)

So. Someone is not telling the truth here. If Cohen can make good on his allegation that Trump knew about the meeting prior to it happening -- and perhaps provide corroborating witnesses to that effect -- it would not only prove the denials by the President and his son wrong, but it would be the biggest step to date in proving (or at least suggesting) real collusion between the Trump team and the Russians. If Cohen is bluffing or can't deliver what he claims, then this is the political equivalent of Al Capone's vault -- much ado about nothing.

The problem here is that neither Trump nor Cohen have a stellar record when it comes to facts. Trump said more than 3,000 untrue or misleading things in just his first 466 days in office, according to The Washington Post's Fact-Checker blog. And Cohen endeared himself to Trump over the years by a demonstrated willingness to say and do whatever it took to solve problems for his boss. (Remember that Cohen insisted Trump knew nothing of the $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels just 11 days before the 2016 election, even though it later came out that Trump had reimbursed him for that payment.)

In the immediate aftermath of the Cohen bombshell -- or, better put, the potential Cohen bombshell -- Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani sat down with CNN's Chris Cuomo to offer a rebuttal. And it consisted entirely of questioning Cohen's credibility.

"I expected something like this from Cohen," Giuliani said. "He's been lying all week. He's been lying for years."

Later, Giuliani added: "I don't see how he has any credibility."

The potential problem with that argument is that for those "years" that Giuliani is referring to, Cohen was one of Trump's closest advisers. In fact, up until Cohen made clear in an interview earlier this month with ABC's George Stephanopoulos that his loyalty to Trump was fading, the President was defending Cohen on Twitter and insisting that he would never "flip." It's only in the last few days -- first with the release of an audio tape of Trump and Cohen chatting about former Playboy model Karen McDougal and now this allegation -- that the Trump team has turned on Cohen so aggressively.

Knowing that Cohen's credibility is everything at this point, his legal team -- led by Lanny Davis -- has been on a bit of a public relations push of late, arguing that Trump's former fixer is a changed man. "This man has turned a corner in his life, has hit a reset button, and he's now dedicated to telling the truth," Davis told Cuomo earlier this week

There are now two major questions that matter going forward on this story:

Will Cohen actually tell Mueller what he knows about the alleged foreknowledge Trump had of the June 2016 meeting? If he does, will the case Cohen can make be enough to convince Mueller? Or does Mueller find the Trump denials more credible?

In short: Where have you gone, Robert Mueller? Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you.
__label__politics (CNN) In a confidential letter to special counsel Robert Mueller in January, President Donald Trump's legal team acknowledged for the first time that Trump "dictated" the first misleading statement put out about his son's controversial 2016 meeting with Russians at Trump Tower.

"You have received all of the notes, communications and testimony indicating that the President dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump, Jr.," the letter said, according to The New York Times, which published a copy of it . "His son then followed up by making a full public disclosure regarding the meeting, including his public testimony that there was nothing to the meeting and certainly no evidence of collusion."

The acknowledgment was tucked away in the letter, which largely focused on defending Trump from a potential subpoena for testimony and asserted broad executive powers to avoid a high-stakes interview with Mueller. The letter, which CNN previously reported on , was signed by Trump's attorneys at the time, John Dowd and Jay Sekulow. Dowd left the legal team in March , while Sekulow continues representing the President.

The misleading statement, issued in July 2017 to The New York Times, obfuscated the true nature of the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower , which was attended by Donald Trump Jr., then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is now a senior White House adviser, and a group of Kremlin-tied Russians

One of those Russians, lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, brought up the Magnitsky Act at the meeting, a 2012 American law punishing Russian human rights violators that she has lobbied extensively to overturn. She reached out to Trump's team after he was elected to try to lobby on the Russian sanctions, CNN has reported.

After the initial statement came out, news outlets reported Trump was involved in preparing the statement. Some reports said he helped draft it, others said he personally "dictated" the words. Trump Jr., meanwhile, told the Senate Judiciary Committee in private testimony in September, released last month, that he didn't speak to his father about the statement, but that the President "may have commented through Hope Hicks," the then-White House aide, and that some of those comments might have made it into the statement.

In their public responses to the news reports, however, Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders denied Trump's role.

The letter revealed on Saturday puts to bed the question of Trump's involvement, but it doesn't erase the previous denials from the record. Here are those examples.

Trump lawyer Sekulow, CNN interview, 7/12/17: "That was written, no that was written by Donald Trump Jr. and I'm sure with consultation with his lawyer. That wasn't written by the president." : "That was written, no that was written by Donald Trump Jr. and I'm sure with consultation with his lawyer. That wasn't written by the president."

Sekulow, ABC interview, 7/12/17 : "The president didn't sign off on anything. He was coming back from the G20. The statement that was released Saturday was released by Donald Trump Jr., I'm sure in consultation with his lawyers. The President wasn't involved in that."

Former President Barack Obama has the most tweets among the top 10 most RTed, with three, while none of President Donald Trump's tweets made the cut.

Here are the top 10 most retweeted tweets in the world in 2017:

__label__politics Story highlights "I love babies. I hear that baby cry, I like it," Trump said

As the baby continued to wail, Trump took back his words

Ashburn, Virginia (CNN) Donald Trump, trying to reassure a distressed mother with a crying baby, said Tuesday that he loves hearing babies cry at his rallies and told her not to worry -- only to change his mind just a moment later.

"I love babies. I hear that baby cry, I like it," Trump said at a campaign event here as a baby could be heard crying in the audience. "What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around, like, don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy and that's what we want."

But less than two minutes later, as the baby continued to wail, Trump took back his words.

"Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here," he said to laughs. "I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking. That's OK. People don't understand. That's OK."

__label__politics "Michael D'Antonio is author of the book, " Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success " (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) The American President has taken his gaslighter-in-chief world tour to Europe and is giving British Prime Minister Theresa May the full treatment. In his epically insulting interview with British tabloid The Sun -- owned by Trump ally Rupert Murdoch -- Donald Trump endorsed May's rival, Boris Johnson, and claimed that May ignored his advice and "wrecked" Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union.

Then, true to form, he claimed the on-the-record interview published by the paper was "fake news," and insisted that everyone accept that "I didn't criticize the Prime Minister."

May chose to play the adult as she joined Trump for a press conference. She calmly defended Britain's immigration policies, which Trump had attacked, and soberly reminded the world that "no two countries do more together than ours to keep their peoples safe and prosperous."

Careful where Trump is chaotic and mature where he is childish, May echoed the overall response offered by steadfast allies whom the President has offended on his European tour. Confronted by a man who sees life as a matter of fighting and likes to demonstrate his strength by picking on the less powerful -- even when they are friends -- May and the others are stepping out of the way to let Trump reveal the content of his character.

Ever since the 1980s, when New York Mayor Ed Koch descended to the gutter to fight with him over an ice skating rink in Central Park, it has been obvious that it's a mistake to mud wrestle with Donald Trump.

His whole method depends on proving that he's no worse than the people he smears, and he may be better because at least he doesn't pretend to have good manners. This tactic means that in the moment one descends to his level, the game is lost. However those who remain composed and calm can focus attention on Trump's ghastly technique.

Trump's first move in this by-now-boring game involves selecting a target who is obviously weaker than him. He is especially keen to go after people who are black, or brown, or female, or in any way less powerful, so he is guaranteed to "win."

At home, this inclination leads Trump to attack a black female member of Congress, Maxine Waters, as having as "low I.Q." and to hurl insults at Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. It also may be what motivates him to separate asylum-seeking Latino mothers from their babies at the Mexico border and to attack a group of mainly black NFL athletes as " sons-of-bitches " because of their kneeling protests during the national anthem

In Europe, Trump has gone after two female leaders -- May, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- who are facing difficult political fights. In kick-'em-when-their-down style, Trump made a fatuous complaint that somehow Germany is "captive" to Russia due to energy imports from that country.

Like May, Merkel took the high road, saying "I myself experienced a part of Germany that was controlled by the Soviet Union, and I am very happy today that we are united in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany. We decide our own policies and make our own decisions, and that's very good."

For Americans who have endured Donald Trump since the 2016 campaign, his pattern of conflict-creation is familiar. We know that his bluster is little more than hot air and that the best response is to remain calm and carry on. We also know to pay attention to the people Trump refuses to confront in a strong way. This list begins with Vladimir Putin.

Moscow's attacks on American democracy contributed to Trump's election win in 2016 and are the subject of the ongoing Mueller probe, which on Friday resulted in the indictment of 12 Russian military officers charged with engaging in a "sustained effort" to hack Democrats' emails and computer networks. Investigators continue to look into the Trump team's contacts with Russians. Meanwhile Putin gets the kid glove treatment from Trump.

Democrats are calling for Trump to cancel his planned meeting with Putin in Helsinki, on news of the indictments, but there is no indication that he will do so. We should note here that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told reporters that he'd informed Trump of the impending indictments days ago -- and he made no move to alter his plans.

Indeed, during his visit to Europe our President has said he expects his session with him to be the "easiest" meeting he will have in Europe.

The most notable thing about Trump's regard for Putin is that fact that the Russian leader is, himself, a pariah whose country is isolated by sanctions and in desperate economic shape.

The odious Putin should be viewed as weak and vulnerable, but Trump treats him with the kind of respect he reserves for the truly powerful. He's not America's friend, but Trump treats him like a buddy. It make one wonder what kind of friendly favors Putin may have done for Trump in the past and what he's holding over him now.
__label__world (CNN) Artist Aziz Al-Asamr holds a plastic cup full of bright yellow paint and puts the finishing touches on his mural.

His canvas: the collapsed concrete roof of a bombed-out house in the Syrian town of Binnish, in opposition-held Idlib province.

He has painted US President Donald Trump, complete with a shock of yellow hair pointing skyward. The President wields a missile aimed at a field of green with crude depictions of a machine-gun, an artillery piece and a tank next to a "chemical hazard" icon.

"I drew him [President Trump] giving Bashar al-Assad and the regime a green light to hit us with any weapons except chemical ones," says Aziz, surveying his work.

For weeks Syrian forces have been massing around the edges of Idlib province, preparing for an offensive to retake the last major part of the country still under the control of the armed opposition.

Earlier this week the White House issued a statement warning that if Syria uses chemical weapons in Idlib, the United States "will respond swiftly and appropriately."

Syrians, still remembering President Barack Obama's famous "red line" speech in 2013, are skeptical.

"Assad did hit with chemical weapons," Aziz says. If the Americans "wanted to remove him or finish him, they would have done it long ago."

Video and interviews obtained by CNN from Idlib show people bracing for the long-expected government offensive, yet well aware that in this, what could be the final battle, they will probably be on their own.

Where would they flee?

Sawsan Al-Saed says she will flee Idlib only if diplomacy fails.

Sawsan Al-Saed runs a pharmacy in the provincial capital, also called Idlib.

"I am convinced that there will not be any military operation," she says.

Sawsan expects that Russia, Syria's main backer, will cut some sort of diplomatic deal with Turkey, which has been the most consistent supporter of the rebel factions in the north.

If, however, diplomacy fails, she says she will leave.

"Once we lose hope that we can't stay here, then we will have to escape, to Turkey or to Europe," she says. "Most people will take to the sea to reach Europe."

Almost 5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the uprising in March 2011. Nearly half Idlib province's population of over 3 million fled or was bussed by the Syrian government under safe-passage agreements to other parts of the country restored to Damascus' control.

Among them are tens of thousands of jihadist fighters, including many members of what is known as Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham, which in an effort to gain international backing has renounced its former affiliation with al Qaeda.

For now, even if Sawsan or others wanted to leave Idlib, they can't.

Turkey, which already hosts around 3 million Syrian refugees, has sealed the border. Refugees could flee to government-controlled areas, but there they face the possibility of fatal retribution.

All seems calm on the streets of Idlib, though Syrian troops are preparing an attack on the city.

'I'm not going anywhere'

The people of Idlib are stuck between a rock and a hard place. So, many, like Yousif Al-Ahmad, who runs a well-stocked grocery store, plan on staying put.

"Some people are worried and afraid," he says. "Some are thinking of fleeing. As for me, I'm not going anywhere."

As for Trump's warning to Damascus, Yusif shrugs.

"Now he's talking and talking and talking, but I don't think he can stop it," he says, referring to the pending government offensive.

Ghaith Al-Sayid, a 21-year old greengrocer, is quick to admit he is worried. He's worried about Russian airstrikes and worried that civilians will, as they usually do, pay the highest price.

"If they're going to strike us," he says, "we should get our women and children out."

The problem is, where?

Calm in the city, for now

Boys play foosball on the sidewalk of Idlib.

The atmosphere in Idlib city appears calm. Men sit in cafes, chatting, smoking and drinking tea and coffee. Boys play foosball on the sidewalk, laughing and joking without, it seems, a care in the world.

Perhaps this façade of calm exists because there's hope the leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran — all key players in Syria — will come to a compromise and avert one last round of bloodshed when they meet this Friday in Tabriz, Iran.

That may be wishful thinking.

Damascus is eager to crush the last pocket of armed resistance, and Russia, in a statement issued by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, says it "will continue the fight against terrorists until their ultimate and total elimination."

A diplomatic breakthrough might postpone Idlib's day of reckoning. A reckoning, however, is inevitable.

French Agriculture Minister Stéphane Travert warned that forces could be sent out to police the waters if there is a repeat of last week's conflict over the molluscs.

"We can't go on this way. We can't have clashes like this," Travert told French news channel CNEWS.

"I don't know if the Royal Navy are in the area but I know that the French navy is ready to intervene if there are clashes. They are there to police the waters."

British and French fishing vessels were involved in clashes in the English Channel last week.

__label__politics TEMPE, Arizona (CNN) Republican Senate candidate Kelli Ward apologized Monday for suggesting an announcement by Sen. John McCain's family that he would end his cancer treatment was designed to hurt her campaign, saying her comment had been misinterpreted.

"I do understand how many could have misconstrued my comments as insensitive, and for this I apologize," Ward told reporters at her campaign headquarters. "The intention of my comments were in no way directed at Sen. McCain or his family."

In a Facebook post over the weekend -- following the McCain family's announcement, but before his death -- one of Ward's campaign staffers speculated that the timing might have been designed "to take media attention off her campaign." Ward seemed to agree, writing in response, "I think they wanted to have a particular narrative that they hope is negative to me."

Reading from a written statement Monday, Ward said she hoped to "set the record straight" regarding her comment, which has sparked backlash in the final stretch of her primary campaign. On Tuesday, she will face off against Rep. Martha McSally, the front-runner, and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio for the Republican nomination in the race to succeed Sen. Jeff Flake.

"To be clear, my comments were in no way directed at Sen. McCain or at his family or his team," she said, adding that they were "in reference to the media" and its "hope for a narrative that would hinder the momentum of our campaign."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Ohio special election for a House seat that's been in Republican hands for three decades was too close to call Tuesday night.

But that it was close at all shows just how daunting the political landscape facing Republicans is headed into November's midterm elections.

Republicans spent millions of dollars to avoid an embarrassing loss, and President Donald Trump visited the district just days before the election. With early and election day votes counted, Republican Troy Balderson has a 0.9-percentage-point edge over Democrat Danny O'Connor, with absentee and provisional ballots remaining.

The other closely watched race where Trump was involved, the Kansas GOP gubernatorial primary, continued into the early Wednesday morning hours. The result there will be a test of Trump's endorsement and should Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach prevail, Democrats believe they could win in the deep-red state (Note: We'll update this piece as results are finalized).

Here are four early takeaways from Tuesday's Ohio special election and primaries in Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington.

1. It's time for Republicans to panic about the House

The neck-and-neck race in a ruby red Ohio district was the latest evidence that the Republican majority in the House is in peril.

Why? Look at the makeup of the district. Trump in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012 each won there by 11 percentage points. There are 68 Republican-held House districts that are more favorable for Democrats, per the Cook Political Report's "Partisan Voter Index," which factors in recent election results -- and Democrats only need a net gain of 23 seats to take control.

Then, consider the turnout. Voters in urban and suburban portions of the district voted at much higher rates than those in its rural, largely pro-Republican areas.

The bottom line: Democratic voters are energized, the suburbs are swinging in their favor and Republicans are sitting elections out. If the GOP can't undo that massive enthusiasm gap by November, its House majority is in serious jeopardy.

Signs of panic were evident Tuesday night. Corry Bliss, the executive director of the GOP-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund, issued a statement warning Republicans that his super PAC can't swamp Democrats in spending in every district, as it did in Ohio.

"While we won tonight, this remains a very tough political environment and moving forward, we cannot expect to win tough races when our candidate is being outraised. Any Republican running for Congress getting vastly outraised by an opponent needs to start raising more money," he said.

What Bliss is warning about is a big problem. Per a CNN analysis, an eye-popping 55 Democratic challengers outraised the Republican incumbents they are facing.

Late into the night, Republicans were watching as yet another reason to worry emerged: In Washington state, the leading Republicans in three GOP-held districts were all being held under 50% of the vote in the state's jungle primary, where Democrats and Republicans compete in the same contest and the top two finishers advance. It could foreshadow trouble for those candidates in the fall.

2. Still waiting in Kansas

Jeff Colyer, left, and Kris Kobach

Kobach was in a dead heat with incumbent Gov. Jeff Colyer in the Republican gubernatorial primary there.

Johnson County, the heavily populated suburbs of Kansas City, had yet to fully report early into Wednesday morning. There's still enough outstanding vote left to count there that could determine the outcome of the contest.

Its results were likely to swing the race.

A loss by Kobach -- who is controversial because he advocates restrictive voting laws and has backed Trump's false claims of widespread voter fraud -- would be an embarrassment for Trump, who has success at picking winners in GOP primaries this year. But it would be a relief for Republicans who see him as a weaker general election candidate.

A Kobach win would underscore Trump's influence among Republican primary voters.

If Colyer wins, he told CNN in an interview Tuesday that some of the credit would belong to former Sen. Bob Dole, who endorsed him.

3. Missouri GOP maneuver backfires

When Missourians gathered more than 300,000 petition signatures to force a referendum on the state's right-to-work law, Republicans who control the state legislature tried to protect the union-busting law with a maneuver they thought would tip the outcome in their favor.

Their move: Put the referendum on the ballot in the August primary, when they expected strong Republican turnout, rather than in the November general election, when they expected pro-union Democrats would show up in full force.

It backfired spectacularly.

Missouri voters rejected the right-to-work law by a 2-to-1 margin -- a remarkable defeat for a Republican priority in a state Trump won by 19 percentage points in 2016.

The result was a major victory for labor unions, which invested $16 million in the campaign. It could also mark a turning point in the Midwest, years after Republicans won battles against unions in states like Wisconsin and Indiana.

"The defeat of this poisonous anti-worker legislation is a victory for all workers across the country," AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a celebratory statement Tuesday night. "The message sent by every single person who worked to defeat Prop. A is clear: When we see an opportunity to use our political voice to give workers a more level playing field, we will seize it with overwhelming passion and determination."

4. Progressive push hits a snag in the Midwest

For progressives hoping for another victory in the mold of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's stunning June ouster of Rep. Joe Crowley, Tuesday was a major letdown.

In the night's marquee contest, progressive outsider Abdul El-Sayed fell well short in his bid to upset former state Senate Minority leader Gretchen Whitmer, who won the nomination at a canter and is now poised for a November showdown with Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette.

Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, who defeated Hillary Clinton in the state two years ago and predicted El-Sayed would follow in his path, campaigned for El-Sayed, who ran on an innovative "Medicare for all" plan and the promise of public broadband and tuition-free college.

Whitmer painted the 33-year-old doctor's platform as mostly unrealistic in a state won by Trump in 2016. She also had the backing of New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and most of the state party establishment. The result means the top of Michigan Democrats' ticket will feature two women: Whitmer and incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow -- another landmark in what's been a bumper year for female candidates.

Keeping with the mixed-bag theme of the night, former state Rep. Rashida Tlaib is projected to win the general election primary to replace former Rep. John Conyers Jr., while Fayrouz Saad lagged far behind in her contest. Both were endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez. Tlaib is on track to become the first Muslim woman in Congress.

But there was more progressive heartbreak in Missouri, where activist Cori Bush lost in her bid to unseat Democratic Rep. William Lacy Clay despite a visit and the vocal support of Ocasio-Cortez.

It was a split decision in Kansas: labor lawyer Brent Welder failed to beat Sharice Davids in the state's 3rd District, CNN projects, despite Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's support. However, they rallied in July for James Thompson, who won the 4th District primary Tuesday and secured a rematch of his 2017 special election against GOP Rep. Ron Estes.

Thompson lost that race by less than 7 points a few months after Republican Mike Pompeo won re-election there by more than 30.
__label__politics (CNN) Democratic primary challenger Cynthia Nixon finally came eye to eye with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday after months of lobbying for the chance, in an animated debate colored by tense exchanges that seemed to get under the incumbent's skin and mirror the often-tempestuous tenor of the campaign.

Cuomo and Nixon sparred over their visions for the state, from health care to how to fix New York City's failing subways, while Cuomo pitched himself -- and his experience -- as a vital tool in beating back President Donald Trump's agenda.

Trying from the outset to brush past Nixon and establish Trump as his true political enemy, Cuomo criticized the White House and highlighted his recent Twitter spats with the President.

"Know me by my enemies," Cuomo said of Trump. "Somebody has to stand up to him."

Nixon fired back, reminding viewers of Cuomo's recent gaffe -- when he said America "was never that great" -- and accusing him of folding when Trump turned the screws.

"You backed down pretty quickly and stood up to him about as well as he stands up to Putin," Nixon said, before pivoting to an outright attack on Cuomo's record, saying that "we already have a corrupt, corporate Republican in the White House. We don't need a corrupt, corporate Democrat in Albany as his main opposition."

The actress and activist turned progressive gubernatorial challenger has consistently run a distant second to Cuomo in the polls, which have put his lead in the 30-point range. Wednesday's debate presented a unique opportunity -- perhaps her last -- to change the trajectory of the race and put Cuomo on edge ahead of the Sept. 13 vote.

When a moderator hinted at his rumored presidential ambitions, asking if Cuomo would pledge to serve a third full four-year term if he was re-elected, the governor was unequivocal: "Yes, yes. Yes and yes. Double yes."

"The only caveat," Cuomo said, "is if God strikes me dead. Otherwise, I will serve four years as governor of New York."

When attention returned to the task at hand, Nixon, as she has throughout the campaign, slammed Cuomo over his handling of the subways and, amid a rapid-fire exchange over how the city and state should divide the burden, Cuomo's guard dropped.

"Excuse me, can you stop interrupting?" he asked.

"Can you stop lying?" Nixon shot back.

"As soon as you do," Cuomo said.

They reprised that back-and-forth after Nixon took a shot at Cuomo over corruption in Albany, the state capital, telling him: "If you stop lying, I'll stop interrupting."

The interjections and asides persisted through the first half of the debate, as Nixon downplayed the two-term governor's experience, saying it "doesn't mean that much if you're not good at governing."

The debate, which lasted an hour, and was hosted by WCBS at Hofstra University on Long Island, was Cuomo's first one-on-one face-off since 2006, when he met Republican Jeanine Pirro ahead of a state attorney general election. The biggest question heading in, given his considerable apparent lead, was whether he could sit tight -- the two candidates were seated for the duration -- and steer clear of any confrontation that might throw him off course.

Before the debate, Joe Dinkin, campaigns director for the Working Families Party, which endorsed Nixon and will have her on its ballot line in November, guessed that "Cuomo's team is prepping him not to lash out and create a moment. His goal will be to make no news."

On that front, Cuomo likely succeeded. Apart from a few flashes of frustration and feisty, made-for-TV exchanges, neither candidate managed a knockout blow.

Cuomo tried to pick off Nixon with repeated attacks on what he described as the slow and circumscribed rollout of her tax returns. When Nixon tried to hit him over "transparency," he returned to the tax question.

"I think my opponent should be careful with that word," Cuomo said of Nixon. "She released five years of corporate taxes -- dumped them in three hours on a Friday with no notice. Only Donald Trump has done less transparency on his taxes than my opponent."

The debaters did manage at least one memorable note of agreement: They both turned down an opportunity to say they wanted the endorsement of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a longtime public foe of Cuomo but friend and ally of Nixon.

"I love Mayor de Blasio; I'm sure he loves me," Cuomo said to laughter -- at least in the press filing center -- when asked. "In a strange sort of way. After 30 years we have a dysfunctional relationship. He makes his own political decisions, not me."

For every jab he landed during the debate, Cuomo might have done more damage in the days before it. On Tuesday, the campaign rolled out a new ad featuring former Vice President Joe Biden, who says, "I've known Andrew for over 20 years. I know he's got skills, guts and experience."

Then, in a bit of pre-debate gamesmanship on Wednesday afternoon, Cuomo's campaign unveiled another ad -- which aired right before the debate -- featuring old clips of Nixon praising the governor before she decided to run against him. The move also underlined the fundraising disparity between the two. Nixon has not run a single television ad, instead spending primarily on digital outreach and voter turnout efforts.

Nixon has criticized Cuomo in the past few months over the dire state of the New York City subway system, a pair of corruption convictions that got close to -- but never implicated -- him and, most recently, his refusal to return campaign donations Trump made before he became President.

Cuomo has argued that the $64,000 in question is better off being used to aid other Democrats running to oppose the Trump agenda. He has responded to broader accusations that his record over nearly eight years in office is insufficiently liberal -- or, as Nixon spokeswoman Lauren Hitt described it, "Republican-lite" -- with a list of achievements, from raising the minimum wage and tightening gun laws to the legalization of same-sex marriage in the state four years before the Supreme Court made it a nationwide right.

Discussion over the heat, or potential lack thereof, in the hall briefly lit up media coverage ahead of the debate after The New York Times first reported on an email from a top Nixon aide to WCBS asking that the room be set to a snug 76 degrees. That number, the Nixon team explained, was as much a starting bid -- Cuomo is known to prefer much cooler climates -- as a note of protest against the process that led up to the debate being, as they said in a statement earlier this month, negotiated without their input and "presented to our campaign on a take-it-or-leave-it basis."

Cuomo spokeswoman Lis Smith hit back at those complaints, saying in a statement Wednesday morning, "The Nixon campaign thrives on paranoia and melodrama." She dismissed the accusations as "silly" and said the governor was focused solely on the meat and potatoes of the debate.

Despite the Nixon campaign's protests over the process that led them there, the debate might have come at a fortuitous time, following the attention-grabbing victory of progressive Democrat Andrew Gillum in Florida's gubernatorial primary on Tuesday. Gillum edged out the front-runner, moderate former Rep. Gwen Graham, the daughter of a former governor and senator, by running a grass-roots campaign to the left of the primary field.

In a tweet late Tuesday, Nixon cast Gillum's come-from-behind win as a sign of things to come.

"Andrew Gillum just won his primary for governor of Florida! Experts said it was impossible. The polls had him at just 16%. We're proving, that if progressives come together, we can win. Now, it is New York's turn," she wrote, including a link asking supporters to "donate to keep our momentum going."

Nixon, though, has a more significant hill to climb, at least according to those polls.
__label__world Tokyo (CNN) The US State Department's top diplomat in charge of North Korea policy is retiring at the end of the week.

Joseph Yun, who is in his early 60s, told CNN Tuesday: "It was completely my decision to retire at this time." He said US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson accepted his resignation "with regret."

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement Yun, who joined the Foreign Service in 1985, decided to leave for personal reasons.

"We are sorry to see him retire, but our diplomatic efforts regarding North Korea will continue based on our maximum pressure campaign to isolate the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) until it agrees to begin credible talks toward a denuclearized Korean peninsula," Nauert said.

Yun's abrupt departure raises questions and adds to uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's North Korea policy as ally South Korea engages in talks with the North for the first time in years. The veteran diplomat had a reputation as a proponent of dialogue when it comes to dealing with North Korea.

It had been Yun's job to help spearhead diplomatic efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions during a year of heightened tensions which appeared to ease with North Korea's participation in the Winter Games.

South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was inappropriate to offer comment on Yun's retirement, though it said it appreciated Yun's efforts in dealing with North Korea.

"I think this is a huge loss for the US government at a critical moment," Abraham Denmark, the director of the Asia Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Denmark worked closely with Yun while the former served as the US deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia during the Obama administration.

"He was a great advocate for dialogue and for diplomacy, and I think it's unfortunate that his voice will no longer be in the conversation inside the US government," Denmark said.

Yun's retirement came as a surprise to many. He was in South Korea and Japan earlier this month to speak with senior government officials from both countries about North Korea issues.

While in Tokyo, Yun said during a rare press conference that he did not believe the US was close to using a military option, though it remained on the table.

"Our policy is based on putting pressure as well as leaving the door open for a dialogue," he said. "I think everyone wants to give diplomacy a good run."

Since his appointment as the US special representative for North Korea policy by the Obama administration in October 2016, Yun has been a key player in implementing US strategy and dealing with the limited bilateral relations maintained by the two countries.

US-North Korea relations became increasingly fraught in 2017 when Pyongyang tested long-range missiles it said could reach the US mainland and Washington spearheaded punitive sanctions against the Kim Jong Un regime.

Yun was also instrumental in securing the release of Otto Warmbier , an American college student detained in North Korea for more than a year. Yun and a medical team went to North Korea to pick him up last June

Warmbier returned to the United States with significant brain damage and died just days later.

Questions

Yun's retirement raises further doubts over the Trump administration's North Korea policy and will likely fuel concerns that the State Department lacks the manpower and expertise to handle the complex negotiations regarding Pyongyang's nuclear program.

Not only is the State Department dealing with an exodus of career diplomats , top posts that deal with North Korea affairs also remain unfilled.

The Senate has yet to confirm Susan Thornton as the chief diplomat for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, though she has been serving in the role in an acting capacity since March 2017. She was officially nominated in January.

And the White House hasn't yet appointed an ambassador to South Korea. In January sources told CNN the long-rumored candidate, Victor Cha , would no longer be nominated. In an opinion piece for the Washington Post, Cha expressed opposition to the White House's consideration of limited military action in North Korea.

"This is the time where we need diplomats and Victor Cha is not there, Joseph Yun after Friday is not there," said Denmark. "There are still several terrific diplomats in place, but we need their voices to be prominent."

It's not clear to what extent Trump is committed to diplomatic efforts to peacefully solve the North Korea nuclear crisis.

At a news conference Friday, Trump said "if we can make a deal, it would be a great thing and if we can't, something will have to happen."

However, in October, the President appeared to dismiss the State Department's diplomatic efforts when he tweeted that Tillerson was "wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man," referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

"Regardless of what (Yun's) reasons are, it is very clear that this administration and in particular the White House does not prioritize diplomacy in foreign policy in writ large and on North Korea in particular," said Michael Fuchs, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs at the State Department who worked directly with Yun.

"What really is concerning is the language that we've been hearing out of National Security Adviser (H.R.) McMaster and President Trump and others at the White House about the possibility of military action."

Yun has traveled the globe tackling North Korean issues, traveling everywhere from Southeast Asia to Russia. His former colleagues describe him as thoughtful, knowledgeable, prepared and funny -- the consummate diplomat.

"Without a doubt, this is a huge loss for the State Department and our policy on North Korea," said Fuchs.
__label__politics (CNN) Because Donald Trump is, well, Donald Trump, a lot of attention has been paid to his hostile takeover of the Republican Party -- and how he continues to consolidate that power.

What that focus on how Trump killed the old -- and by that we mean the 2012 -- version of the Republican Party misses is how much the Democratic Party has evolved -- and is evolving -- in its own way.

Like Republicans, that change sped up -- rapidly -- in 2016. It was led by an unlikely figure -- Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. To say Sanders was lightly regarded when he started running against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is to do a disservice to the term "lightly regarded."

But what Sanders understood was that the Democratic Party of 2016 wasn't the "Third Way," centrism-over-all Democratic Party of Bill Clinton and the mid-1990s. The Democratic base had moved to the left on virtually every issue -- pushed that way by the financial collapse of the late 2000s and ready to be mobilized on behalf of a candidate who embraced things like radical campaign finance reform, single-payer health care insurance and unapologetic tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans.

Sanders didn't win. But he awoke something in Democrats. And, when Hillary Clinton lost the general election to Donald Trump, Sanders' message and stock gained further prominence. Voters wanted someone who said what they meant and meant what they said.

In the wake of that 2016 loss, candidates inspired by his unapologetic liberalism -- if not his weak affiliation with the Democratic Party -- began recruiting themselves into races. While the upset primary victory of fellow Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York drew the most attention, other progressives such as Ilhan Omar and Jahana Hayes have won primaries too. (One notable exception: The Midwest, where establishment Democrats in a number of high-profile primaries beat back Sanders-inspired -- and endorsed -- candidates.)

The last two years have proven -- beyond any reasonable debate -- that the progressive end of the party is growing. Whether that growth is enough to produce a nominee from that end of the party remains a question.

What's interesting to contemplate is that while Sanders may be the founder of the (r)evolution within the Democratic Party, he may well watch politicians who are later-arrivers to his brand of liberalism pass him by in the fight for the party nod come 2020. Sanders, who will be 79 on Election Day 2020, may struggle to argue that he is the "new" face that many Democrats want.

The point: Even if Sanders doesn't improve on his 2016 showing (assuming he runs in 2020), he will have had a profound impact on the future course of the Democratic Party. Without further ado, here are our new rankings of the 10 Democrats most likely to wind up as the nominee against Trump. (For last month's ratings, click here .)

ADDED from last month: Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar

DROPPED from last month: Eric Holder, Sherrod Brown, Mitch Landrieu

10. Steve Bullock: The Montana governor is, without question, the least well-known candidate on our list -- for the second straight month. And his profile -- a moderate, pragmatic problem-solver -- might not play well in a Democratic Party that seems to want politicians willing to throw a punch or 10.

But Bullock is the most aggressive candidate this side of Garcetti (and, of course, longshot Rep. John Delaney , who has already announced his bid) in terms of positioning himself for a run. And even we were somewhat taken aback by what a positive response our inclusion of Bullock last month got from smart Democratic insiders. (Previous ranking: 7)

9. Amy Klobuchar: There's a lot to like about Klobuchar, who debuts on the list at number nine. You want someone who is a proven winner in the Upper Midwest? She's well on her way to winning a third term in the Senate from Minnesota. (Note: Minnesota's proximity to Iowa could also help launch her in the first-in-the-nation contest.) You want someone from a law-and-order background to beat back Trump's rhetoric on crime? Klobuchar's a former prosecutor. She's also a she, which can only help given the primary electorate's voting patterns in 2018. Klobuchar has two obvious flaws. One, she may be too moderate for the base. Two, she hails from a There's a lot to like about Klobuchar, who debuts on the list at number nine. You want someone who is a proven winner in the Upper Midwest?

Two, she hails from a very white state and lacks the long-term connection with black voters. (Previous ranking: Unranked)

8. Eric Garcetti: We're convinced that in a field as large as 2020 is likely to be that a mayor -- particularly of a major metropolis -- has a chance to be a bit of a dark horse. Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles takes New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu's place in this month's rankings because he is, at the moment, generating far more buzz for his potential candidacy than Landrieu. That's the result of Garcetti's aggressiveness when it comes to the possibility of running; he's made no secret he's interested and We're convinced that in a field as large as 2020 is likely to be that a mayor -- particularly of a major metropolis -- has a chance to be a bit of a dark horse. Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles takes New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu's place in this month's rankings because he is, at the moment, generating far more buzz for his potential candidacy than Landrieu. That's the result of Garcetti's aggressiveness when it comes to the possibility of running; he's made no secret he's interested and has already raised $100,000 for the South Carolina Democratic Party with plans to do the same for the state parties in New Hampshire and Iowa. Although Garcetti is far from a household name nationally just yet, his profile -- he's young (47), of both Jewish and Mexican heritage and a West Coaster -- could be appealing to a Democratic electorate looking for something different.

7. Cory Booker: It's difficult to run for president and not have your heart in it. That would never be a question with Booker. He clearly : It's difficult to run for president and not have your heart in it. That would never be a question with Booker. He clearly loves the limelight . Booker also recognizes that the Democratic Party has moved to the left, which would at least partially explain why he has such a liberal voting record. And if you're looking for a politician who is liberal and black (and could appeal to both those groups) like a certain first-term senator named Obama, then Booker (who is serving his first full term) is better positioned than most. Booker has a few issues. His oratory can strike some as inauthentic . And while Obama was able to placate the progressive base, Booker's ties to Wall Street may prevent that. (Previous ranking: 8)

6. Deval Patrick: We left the former Massachusetts governor off : We left the former Massachusetts governor off our last list because, well, we weren't sure he was serious about actually running. We've been convinced otherwise since. For example: A former Massachusetts governor doesn't go to Texas in the sweltering heat of late July to campaign for Democratic candidates if he is perfectly content in the private sector. While it's unlikely that there will be any single "Obama" candidate -- given that the former President has ties to so many people in the potential field -- there's little question that Patrick is closely aligned with many Obama insiders and some of the major donors that helped finance the former President's bids . Plus, being an African-American two-term governor of one of the most liberal states in the country isn't a bad place to start from in the modern Democratic presidential primary electorate. (Previous ranking: Unranked)

5. Bernie Sanders: Perhaps no pick generated as much controversy last month as placing Vermont's junior senator at number five. Some wanted him higher because he retains high favorable ratings nationally and came in second to Hillary Clinton in 2016. Both are fair points, and why he's so high up on the list. Sanders' problem is he's trailing Biden, has many of Biden's flaws (old, white and male) and carries a huge additional one: Sanders is not a Democrat. Even after winning the Democratic nomination for Senate in 2018, he : Perhaps no pick generated as much controversy last month as placing Vermont's junior senator at number five.

Sanders' problem is he's trailing Biden, has many of Biden's flaws (old, white and male) and carries a huge additional one: Sanders is not a Democrat. Even after winning the Democratic nomination for Senate in 2018, he declined the nomination and forged ahead with his independent bid. Most of the people who vote in Democratic primaries are Democrats. (Previous ranking: 5)

4. Kirsten Gillibrand: No one's ranking this side of Bernie Sanders got a bigger reaction from people last month than the New York senator's. Lots and lots of people think we have her ranked too high for, among other reasons, the fact that her conservative record as a House member suggests her liberal turn is easily caricatured as entirely political. Maybe! But the 2018 primary season so far has taught us that the Democratic Party wants to elect liberal women. And Gillibrand will have the record (in the Senate) and the money to make that case. (Previous ranking: 4)

3. Kamala Harris: Harris carries obvious advantages that few other Democrats can claim. We saw how Trump leveraged the media to his advantage in 2016, and Harris hails from the state with the second-largest media market in the country (Los Angeles). Being an Indian-American and African-American woman will help her draw a sharp contrast with a white male Republican who made his bones in reactionary politics. Harris is also very liberal in a party that is becoming more liberal, but has ties to the establishment. The latter may hurt her, though so far the : Harris carries obvious advantages that few other Democrats can claim.

Harris is also very liberal in a party that is becoming more liberal, but has ties to the establishment. The latter may hurt her, though so far the establishment is doing about as well in 2018 primaries as it did in 2016. (Previous ranking: 3)

2. Elizabeth Warren: "We believe that in America every family deserves a fighting chance, and we're ready to fight as hard as it takes, as long as it takes, to deliver on that promise," : "We believe that in America every family deserves a fighting chance, and we're ready to fight as hard as it takes, as long as it takes, to deliver on that promise," the Massachusetts senator said earlier this month . "I get it. It won't be easy. We're going to have to fight uphill. But me? I'm going up that hill. And I hope you are, too." That speech was to the liberal Netroots Nation annual convention, but it could easily double as a piece of Warren's 2020 announcement/stump speech. That sort of leaning-in rhetoric coupled with the fact that two of Warren's aides have recently signed on to senior positions in the New Hampshire Democratic Party make it pretty easy to connect the dots: She's running. (Previous ranking: 2)

1. Joe Biden: The former vice president retains the top ranking on our list. Yes, his age (75) and the fact that he's a white man have their disadvantages in a Democratic Party that is getting younger, more diverse and is nominating more women every cycle. Biden, though, continues to have clear advantages: he was the vice president to President Barack Obama, who remains the closest thing the party has to a leader. And Biden himself is very popular. He also currently ahead of his nearest competitor by about 10 points in primary polls. Even at this point, polls have forecasted the nominee since 1972 about half the time when no incumbent was running for a major party nomination. (Previous ranking: 1)
__label__world Rome (CNN) Several dozen conservative Catholic scholars and clergy have charged Pope Francis with spreading heresy, a bold but perhaps futile salvo against Francis and his reform-minded papacy.

The widely publicized, theologically dense letter was delivered to the Pope with 40 signatures on August 11, according to its organizers. It has since gained 22 more signatures and was released to the public on Saturday. In a press release, the organizers say they speak for "a large number" of clergy and lay Catholics who "lack freedom of speech."

The letter does not accuse the Pope himself of being a heretic, but of supporting "heretical positions" on "marriage, the moral life and the Eucharist."

Francis has not responded to the letter publicly and the Vatican declined to comment.

The letter's organizers call their challenge a "filial correction" of the Pope by his "spiritual sons and daughters."

"Church law itself requires that competent persons not remain silent when the pastors of the Church are misleading the flock," the conservative Catholic clergy and scholars said.

Specifically, the letter charges Francis with promoting seven "heresies," most notably through his openness to allowing some divorced and remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion.

"Scandal concerning faith and morals has been given to the Church and to the world," the letter states. It accuses the Pope of imposing "strange doctrines on the faithful," and asks him to publicly correct his teachings.

The lightning rod for complaints is the Pope's 2016 document, Amoris Laetitia -- which has opened the possibility for some divorced and remarried Catholics to receive communion -- and the differing interpretations of the document, which conservatives say have sown confusion among Catholics.

press release accompanying the letter calls it an "epoch-making act," with no precedent since 1333. That may be true, Catholic historians say, but likely overstates the letter's actual significance. A number of the signees are members of a traditionalist group that has already broken away from the Catholic Church.

Still, the heresy charge crystallizes some conservatives' deep anxieties about Pope Francis, especially his teachings and impromptu statements about how to apply centuries-old Catholic doctrine to the complexities of modern life.

Last year, four cardinals, in a letter known as a Dubia , asked the Pope to clarify some of the same points raised by the Catholic scholars and priests.

Pope Francis has not responded to that letter, either.

Who's behind the heresy charge?

None of the heresy letter's signees are cardinals or bishops in good standing within the Catholic church. The most prominent is Bishop Bernard Fellay, the head of the Society of St. Pius X, a traditionalist group which broke away from the Vatican under Pope John Paul II over doctrinal issues.

In some ways, Fellay's participation is curious. As the letter's organizers note, Francis has sought to welcome the conservative Society of St. Pius X, provided they agree to certain church teachings.

Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, former president of the Vatican bank, is also a signee.

Joseph Shaw, one of the organizers of the letter and a professor of philosophy at Oxford University, said that he hopes the Pope will answer the letter, but that it wasn't written for his eyes only.

"Pope Francis may be determined not to answer this, but it's not to say that bishops and cardinals aren't able to absorb it," he said. "We have to press this problem on to people who can ultimately address them."

"If people become convinced that what he is doing is a grave mistake, the machine will seize up," he continued. "There will be a reluctance to implement what he is doing."

Public spats and division followed the 2016 publication of the Amoris Laetitia, which resulted in different bishops around the world offering different interpretations of the teaching.

For example, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, an American newly appointed to a top Vatican office by Francis last year, has publicly disagreed with Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput, about whether divorced and remarried Catholics can receive Communion.

Bishops conferences from Malta, Argentina, Poland, Germany and elsewhere have also weighed in with different interpretations of the Pope's ruling.

Conservatives contest that the Pope is tinkering with what is written in the Bible and has been affirmed throughout centuries in the Catholic Church on marriage: that a divorced person who is remarried without an annulment may not receive communion, because the second marriage is considered adulterous.

"You can have a diversion of pastoral practice on some things," says Shaw. "But you can't have variation on whether marriage is indissoluble; you can't have variation on whether you can receive communion."

Francis' supporters say the Pope is not changing doctrine, but updating the practice of how the Catholic Church can meet the realities of today's families.

"We need to not just criticize, we need to say what our teaching is -- and that's not just a yes and no answer," Farrell told Catholic News Agency.

What's next?

It is no surprise that there is resistance to change within the Catholic Church, which claims a tradition of uninterrupted teachings since the time of Christ. The question is whether Francis can hold together the church's left and right flanks while implementing reforms in how the church applies those teachings.

Monsignor Robert Wister, a professor of church history at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, said he can't recall anything similar to the heresy letter in recent times. Pope John XXII was rebuked in the 1330s for teaching that the souls of the dead do not see the face of God until the Last Judgment.

"But it's really hard to make a comparison," he said. "Nine hundred years ago, most Catholics were illiterate. Now everybody is on Twitter."

So what effect will the heresy letter have on Francis' papacy?

"In the grand scheme of things, it will fuel some of the more extreme anti-Francis websites," Wister said. "And I think it will encourage various priests and bishops who do not like his pastoral direction."

"But, if you look in the pews or even at polls, most people like Francis," he said. "They see in him a compassion they have not seen in the church, an understanding of the very difficult reality of living in this very complicated world."
__label__politics (CNN) On Monday, President Donald Trump sent seven -- yes, seven! -- tweets attacking his former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman over claims she made in her tell-all memoir that was formally released today.

He followed that tweet-rant with this shot at Omarosa on Tuesday morning : "When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn't work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!"

Eight tweets in 24 hours -- all about Omarosa. Eight tweets in which Trump refers to Omarosa, an African-American woman and former White House employee, as, among other things, a "dog," "wacky," "deranged," a "crazed, crying lowlife," "vicious" and "not smart."

Now ask yourself this: Would you ever be as focused -- bordering on obsessed -- with someone who you didn't care about and who you genuinely believed was just saying all sorts of false things? Would you call that person all sorts of names -- including a number with quite clear racial under- (and over-) tones, if that person didn't matter?

The answer of course is "no." The fact that Trump appears to be absolutely fixated on Omarosa -- and the book she wrote about her time in the White House -- speaks to the fact that Trump is concerned about what impact the allegations she makes about him might have.

(His Omarosa tweets came among a particularly active morning on Twitter for the President, during which he also attacked Bruce Ohr of the "Justice" Department -- the quotes around "Justice" are Trump's -- "disgraced" Christopher Steele, Ohr's wife Nelly, recently fired FBI agent Peter Strzok, plus his old standby, Hillary Clinton).

Trump, displaying a rare bit of self-awareness, tried to justify why he was spending so much time tweeting about Omarosa in a Monday tweet. "While I know it's 'not presidential' to take on a lowlife like Omarosa, and while I would rather not be doing so, this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible," he tweeted . "Sorry!" (Narrator voice: He's not sorry.)

The problem for Trump is that he always reveals his true colors if you wait long enough. And by "long enough," I mean a few hours. Since that "not presidential" tweet, Trump has tweeted (or retweeted) six more times about Omarosa. And in that flurry of tweets he has revealed that Omarosa signed a non-disclosure agreement, further stoked the idea that he is willing to play with racial language for his personal political benefit and even retweeted Michael Cohen -- his former lawyer/fixer who the President has spent the last few weeks running down as Cohen appears to be willing to turn on his former boss.

None of those tweets are remotely good for Trump's political and legal standing. So why did Trump do it? Because he can't help himself.

Think about this: What does it say about Trump that he hired and fired Omarosa -- by his own count -- four times, in both reality TV life and, um, real life? To get fired four times by the same person means that you have been hired four times by that person. And in normal life, that would never happen. Maybe you would get hired and fired by the same person (or company) twice in your life. Maybe. But four times? That speaks to something totally outside the ordinary, a compulsion of sorts.

And it's not hard to see what draws Trump to Omarosa: She is, in many ways, just like him. She gets that drama works, that being the center of attention is all that matters, that death isn't bad press but no press. She's willing to do whatever it takes to win -- and remember that winning is understood by the likes of Trump and Omarosa by simply being essential or relevant.

Again, Trump's Twitter feed is revealing when it comes to Omarosa.

Trump has kicked his character assassination effort into high gear on Omarosa over the last 24 hours because he knows what she's capable of -- and how dangerous she can be. He knows this because he knows what he is capable of and how dangerous he can be. Omarosa -- and her allegations -- pose a threat to Trump even while a decent chunk of them have already been rebutted. And he knows it.

Omarosa is, in some ways, the greatest creation of the Trump reality TV era. She is just like him, which is why he understands her and knows the damage she is capable of inflicting. It's an absolutely fascinating bit of psychodrama that would make for a terrific twist in a reality TV series.

Unfortunately for all of us, this isn't "The Apprentice." It's real life.
__label__politics (CNN) Whenever America was in a fight during his long lifetime, John McCain was in the thick of it.

McCain, who has died at the age of 81, was a naval bomber pilot, prisoner of war, conservative maverick, giant of the Senate, twice-defeated presidential candidate and an abrasive American hero with a twinkle in his eye.

The Arizonan warrior politician, who survived plane crashes, several bouts of skin cancer and brushes with political oblivion, often seemed to be perpetually waging a race against time and his own mortality while striving to ensure that his five-and-a-half years as a Vietnam prisoner of war did not stand as the defining experience of his life.

He spent his last few months out of the public eye in his adopted home state of Arizona, reflecting on the meaning of his life and accepting visits from a stream of friends and old political combatants.

In a memoir published in May, McCain wrote that he hated to leave the world, but had no complaints.

JUST WATCHED John McCain's hearse leaves his home Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH John McCain's hearse leaves his home 01:26

"It's been quite a ride. I've known great passions, seen amazing wonders, fought in a war, and helped make peace," McCain wrote. "I've lived very well and I've been deprived of all comforts. I've been as lonely as a person can be and I've enjoyed the company of heroes. I've suffered the deepest despair and experienced the highest exultation.

"I made a small place for myself in the story of America and the history of my times."

McCain had not been in Washington since December, leaving a vacuum in the corridors of the Senate and the television news studios he roamed for decades.

In recent months, he was not completely quiet, however, blasting President Donald Trump in a series of tweets and statements that showed that while he was ailing he had lost none of his appetite for the political fight.

The Arizona Senator repeatedly made clear that he saw Trump and his America First ideology as a departure from the values and traditions of global leadership that he saw epitomized in the United States.

McCain had been planning his funeral services over the last year and his family made clear that Trump is not invited, a position that has not changed, two family friends said Saturday. Former rivals and Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush were asked to give eulogies, people close to both former presidents and a source close to the senator told CNN earlier this year.

McCain's two losing presidential campaigns meant he fell short of the ultimate political prize, one his story once seemed to promise after he came home from Vietnam and caught the political bug. In the end, he became a scourge of presidents rather than President himself.

At the time of his death, he was largely an anomaly in his own party -- as one of the few Republicans willing to criticize Trump and a believer in the idealized "shining city on a hill" brand of conservatism exemplified by his hero Ronald Reagan that has been dislodged by the nativist and polarizing instincts of the current President. He was also a throwback to an earlier era when political leaders, without betraying their own ideology, were willing on occasion to cross partisan lines.

In a Washington career that spanned 40 years, first as a Navy Senate liaison, then as a member of the House and finally as the occupant of the Senate seat he took over from Barry Goldwater, McCain was a conservative and a foreign policy hawk. But he was not always a reliable Republican vote, and sometimes in a career that stretched into a sixth Senate term, he confounded party leaders with his maverick stands. He defied party orthodoxy to embrace campaign finance reform, and excoriated President George W. Bush's defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, for not taking enough troops to Iraq.

After Obama ended McCain's second White House race in 2008, the senator blasted the new President's troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, causing critics to carp that he had not yet reconciled the bitterness he felt in defeat. McCain had supported the invasion of Iraq carried out by the Bush administration in 2003, but admitted in his memoir "The Restless Wave" that the rationale, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction was wrong.

"The war, with its cost in lives and treasure and security, can't be judged as anything other than a mistake, a very serious one, and I have to accept my share of the blame for it," he wrote.

More recently, as death approached, he became a strident critic of Trump, who had once said he didn't consider the Arizona senator a war hero because he had been captured.

McCain questioned why Trump was solicitous of Vladimir Putin, whom he regarded as an unreformed KGB apparatchik.

In one of his final public acts, he blasted Trump's cozy summit with the Russian President in July, blasting it as "one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory."

"The damage inflicted by President Trump's naiveté, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate. But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake," he said in a statement.

In July 2017, McCain returned from brain surgery to the Senate floor to lambaste "bombastic loudmouths" on the television, radio and internet and plead for a return to a more civilized political age, when compromise and regular order forged bipartisan solutions.

Then, in September, in a poignant speech that seemed designed to echo down the ages after he was gone, McCain reminded his colleagues they were a check on executive power: "We are not the President's subordinates," he said. "We are his equals."

In a final act of defiant independence, McCain, with a dramatic thumbs-down gesture on the Senate floor in September, cast the vote that scuttled the GOP's effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, causing fury within his party -- a move that prompted Trump, to the fury of McCain's family to repeatedly single him out in campaign rallies.

When the President signed McCain's last legislative triumph in August, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act, he did not even mention the Arizona senator.

'I wasn't my own man anymore; I was my country's'

John Sidney McCain III, the son and grandson of Navy admirals, entered the world on August 29, 1936, in the Panama Canal Zone, a birthplace that years later would cause a brief campaign kerfuffle over whether he was a natural born citizen and thus eligible to be elected president.

His habit of insubordination despite his military pedigree emerged at the Naval Academy, where he graduated fifth from the bottom of his class.

"My superiors didn't hold me in very high esteem in those days. Their disapproval was measured in the hundreds of miles of extra duty I marched in my time here," McCain told graduates at Annapolis in October of last year.

By 1967, McCain was in the Pacific and escaped death in a massive fire aboard the USS Forrestal aircraft carrier. Months later, he was shot down in his Skyhawk jet over North Vietnam and parachuted into a lake near Hanoi, breaking both arms and a leg, and was captured by communist soldiers. In captivity, McCain was tortured and beaten, an experience that left him with lifelong injuries, including severely restricted movement of his arms. He kept himself sane by tapping on a wall to communicate with a fellow prisoner in a neighboring cell. Later, he refused the offer of a preferential release, made because his father was an admiral, until his comrades could also come home, eventually returning in 1973 to a nation politically torn by the war.

His period in captivity set the course of his life.

"I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's," McCain said in his 2008 Republican National Convention speech.

"I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again; I wasn't my own man anymore; I was my country's."

After turning to politics, McCain served in the House from 1983, won an Arizona US Senate seat in 1986 and established himself as a down-the-line conservative in the age of Ronald Reagan. But his political career almost fizzled before it began when he was among the Keating Five group of senators accused of interfering with regulators in a campaign finance case. He was cleared of wrongdoing, but the Senate Ethics Committee reprimanded him for poor judgment, an experience that led to him becoming a pioneer of campaign finance reform.

He didn't forget his time in Vietnam.

In an act of reconciliation, McCain joined Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, a fellow decorated Vietnam War veteran, to help end the US trade embargo on its former southeast Asian enemy in a process that led to the eventual reopening of diplomatic relations.

By 2000, McCain set his sights on the White House and ran as a maverick Republican, holding court for hours in candid back-and-forth sessions with reporters on his campaign bus, dubbed the "Straight Talk Express." In years to come, he would joke that his adoring press pack was his "base."

After skipping Iowa over his long opposition to ethanol subsidies, McCain forged a victory over establishment favorite and then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire after a string of town hall meetings with voters.

But his effort hit a brick wall in South Carolina, where the campaign turned negative and McCain's independent streak hurt him in a state with more core conservatives and fewer independents. Bush got back on track with a primary win that set him on the road to the nomination.

The maverick of the Senate

Back in the Senate, McCain heard the call of war again, as American foreign policy was transformed after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, and he became a forceful proponent of the US use of force overseas. He backed US interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. When Americans tired of war, McCain warned that more troops were needed, demanding a surge in forces that Bush later adopted.

When it appeared that his hawkish views were at odds with the electorate and could damage his nascent 2008 presidential bid, McCain answered: "I would rather lose a campaign than a war."

But, influenced by his experience of torture in Vietnam, McCain was a forceful critic of the enhanced interrogation techniques used by the CIA on terror suspects, believing they were contrary to American values and damaged the US image abroad.

It was a typical example of the Arizona senator adopting a position that appeared antithetical to his political interests or ran counter to the perceived wisdom of his party.

After the Keating Five scandal, he joined a crusade with Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin to introduce new restrictions on "soft" and corporate money in political campaigns.

Later, McCain teamed up with his great friend, late Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy on a bill that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The measure failed, however, over building grassroots antipathy to such a move in the GOP, which would later play a major role in the Trump campaign in the 2016 election.

McCain set his sights on the White House again during Bush's second term. By 2007, his campaign was all but broke. But he fired up the Straight Talk Express again and pulled off another famous comeback, barnstorming to victory once more in the New Hampshire primary.

This time, he also won South Carolina, and beat a fading Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani in Florida before effectively clinching the nomination with a clutch of wins on Super Tuesday.

That November, McCain came up against the historic appeal of a much younger and more eloquent rival, Obama. Mocking the Illinois senator in ads as "the biggest celebrity in the world," McCain questioned whether his popular foe was ready to lead.

Seeking to rebrand himself in a change election, McCain stunned the political world by picking little-known Sarah Palin as his running mate. The Alaska governor delivered a spellbinding convention speech, and for several weeks it seemed as if McCain's gamble worked.

But a series of gaffes turned Palin into a figure of ridicule and undercut McCain's contention that his ticket, and not Obama's, was best qualified to lead in a dangerous world. McCain, however, would not say that he regretted picking Palin.

But in his new memoir, "The Restless Wave," and in a separate documentary, McCain said he wished he had ignored the advice of his advisers and listened to his gut and chosen Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat-turned-independent, calling it "another mistake that I made."

But McCain also rose above the ugliness of the campaign. On one occasion, he cut off a supporter at a town hall event who said she could not trust Obama because she thought he was an Arab, amid conspiracy theories suggesting that the Democrat had not been not born in America.

"No ma'am, he's a decent family man, citizen, who I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about," McCain said.

He dealt with his defeat by throwing himself back into life in the Senate. In later years he described how it felt to lose, telling anyone who asked, "After I lost ... I slept like a baby — sleep two hours, wake up and cry."

But his relationship with Obama was tense, with the President snubbing his former foe in a health care summit in 2010 by telling him "the election's over."

The Arizona senator emerged as a fierce critic of Obama's worldview, prompting Democrats to complain that McCain was the embodiment of a Republican reflex to respond to every global problem with military force, which had led America into misadventures like the war in Iraq.

McCain's robust foreign policy views were reflected on the walls of his Senate conference room, which featured letters and photos from the likes of Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, leaders who didn't suffer critics gladly.

Still, McCain was also a throwback, enjoying friendships with rivals across the political aisle, and indulging in the back-slapping bonhomie of the Senate, where he invariably held court to a crowd between votes.

Sometimes things got testy with his Democratic pals, including when he confronted Hillary Clinton and fellow Vietnam War veteran Kerry during hearings of the Senate Armed Services Committee while they served as secretaries of state under Obama.

'He served his country ... and, I hope we could add, honorably'

The Republicans' recapture of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections gave McCain a chance to rewrite the final chapter of his career.

He at last took the gavel of the Armed Services Committee, an assignment he had long coveted. His prominent position was seen as one reason he ran for re-election in 2016.

But he knew his time was limited.

"Every single day," McCain told The New York Times in 2015, "is a day less that I am going to be able to serve in the Senate."

Still, despite saying he was "older than dirt," McCain made few concessions to his age. Even after turning 80, he maintained a punishing schedule of world travel, conferring with top leaders and heading to war zones in trips that left his younger congressional colleagues exhausted.

He would blitz Sunday talk shows, direct from Arizona in the dawn hours. When Trump was elected, McCain took it upon himself to reassure world leaders, visiting multiple countries in the first six months of 2017 before his diagnosis.

His sidekick, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, told CNN the hectic pace had taken a toll.

"You know he just wore himself out traveling all around the world," Graham said.

McCain, who was divorced from his first wife, Carol, in 1980, is survived by his wife, Cindy, and seven children, including three sons who continued the family tradition of serving in the armed forces and a daughter, Meghan, who is a presenter on ABC's "The View." His mother, Roberta, aged 106, is also still living.

For his military service, he was awarded the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit, a Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross.

He faced his final diagnosis with characteristic courage, telling CNN's Jake Tapper that "every life has to end one way or another."

Asked how he wanted to be remembered, McCain said: "He served his country, and not always right -- made a lot of mistakes, made a lot of errors -- but served his country, and, I hope we could add, honorably."

McCain, who will be remembered as much for his combative nature as his political achievements, summed up the meaning of a life forged in the example of his political hero Theodore Roosevelt when McCain stood before the flag-draped coffin of his friend and foe, Sen. Kennedy, in 2009.

His late colleague from Massachusetts died from the same form of brain cancer that eventually killed McCain. Both men died on August 25.

"Ted and I shared the sentiment that a fight not joined was a fight not enjoyed."
__label__politics (CNN) First lady Melania Trump took a trip to the US-Mexico border on Thursday to tour an immigrant children's shelter, but her trip is getting attention not only for her action, but also for her wardrobe choice before and after the journey.

As the first lady boarded her plane from Andrews Air Force Base, she wore an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read: "I really don't care. Do u?" in white graffiti-style lettering. Trump was not wearing the jacket when she landed in McAllen, Texas. She re-donned the jacket and wore it when she deplaned back at Andrews Air Force Base despite the media storm that had erupted over her initial wearing.

The $39 jacket is last season Zara.

The Daily Mail first reported the jacket , which was spotted by the press traveling with the first lady but impossible to read without a long-range camera lens.

The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice.

__label__politics (CNN) The United States and Mexico have reached an agreement to change parts of NAFTA, the trade deal that President Donald Trump has derided for years as unfair.

Trump announced the agreement from the Oval Office Monday, with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto dialed in on a conference call.

But the deal left open the question of whether Canada, the third country in NAFTA, would agree to the changes -- and Trump himself said he wanted to throw out the name NAFTA altogether.

"They used to call it NAFTA," Trump said. "We're going to call it the United States-Mexico trade agreement. We're going to get rid of NAFTA because it has a bad connotation."

US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the agreement was "absolutely terrific" and would modernize a trade deal that had "gotten seriously out of whack." He said he hoped Congress would approve it with broad bipartisan support.

__label__politics (CNN) Presidential candidate Donald Trump is heard on tape discussing with his attorney Michael Cohen how they would buy the rights to a Playboy model's story about an alleged affair Trump had with her years earlier, according to the audio recording of the conversation aired exclusively on CNN's "Cuomo Prime Time."

The recording offers the public a glimpse at the confidential discussions between Trump and Cohen, and it confirms the man who now occupies the Oval Office had contemporaneous knowledge of a proposal to buy the rights to the story of Karen McDougal, a woman who has alleged she had an extramarital affair with Trump about a decade ago.

Cohen told Trump about his plans to set up a company and finance the purchase of the rights from American Media, which publishes the National Enquirer. The recording captures what appears to be a routine business conversation of several matters on their agenda. The audio is muddled and the meaning of Trump's use of the word "cash" is disputed by the two sides.

"I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David," Cohen said in the recording, likely a reference to American Media head David Pecker.

When financing comes up again later in the conversation, Trump interrupts Cohen asking, "What financing?" according to the recording. When Cohen tells Trump, "We'll have to pay," Trump is heard saying "pay with cash" but the audio is muddled and it's unclear whether he suggests paying with cash or not paying. Cohen says, "no, no" but it is not clear what is said next.

No payment was ever made from Trump, Rudy Giuliani, the President's attorney, has said. Giuliani has previously acknowledged that the recorded discussion related to the buying the story rights.

JUST WATCHED Cohen lawyer: Only mobsters use cash Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cohen lawyer: Only mobsters use cash 02:15

"There's no indication of any crime being committed on this tape," Giuliani said on Fox News Channel Tuesday night.

Trump blasted Cohen over the disclosure Wednesday morning.

"What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad!" Trump tweeted.

The recording, which was provided to CNN by Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis, was made in September 2016. It's the latest breakdown in the decade-long relationship between Trump and Cohen, who once said he would take a bullet for the President. Cohen in recent weeks has made clear he is open to cooperating with US prosecutors.

"What is this about? This is about honesty versus false disparagement of Michael Cohen. Why is Giuliani out falsely disparaging Michael Cohen -- because they fear him," Davis said on "Cuomo Prime Time."

"What do they fear, Chris? Why am I representing him? They fear that he has the truth about Donald Trump. He will someday speak the truth about Donald Trump. The truth is that when Donald Trump said 'cash,' which Rudy Giuliani knows that only drug dealers and mobsters talk about cash, it was, you heard Michael Cohen ... say what? 'No, no, no, no.'"

Davis later added: "Ladies and gentlemen, if you voted for Donald Trump, listen to the tape and ask yourself: Is Donald Trump lying when he said he didn't use the word 'cash' and accuses Michael Cohen of using the word 'cash'? Cohen has been disparaged. Cohen has been insulted and called all sorts of things by people around Donald Trump."

Giuliani and Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, refuted that the tape shows Trump was offering a cash payment.

"There's no way the President is going to be setting up a corporation and then using cash, unless you're a complete idiot," Giuliani said on Fox News Tuesday night.

"This was leaked on us with a very, very scurrilous description of what was on the tape," he added.

Cash, in the conversation, was in reference to how a deal would be financed, Futerfas said.

"Whoever is telling Davis that cash in that conversation refers to green currency is lying to him," Futerfas told CNN. "There's no transaction done in green currency. It doesn't happen. The whole deal never happened. If it was going to happen, it would be a payment to a large company that would obviously be accompanied by an agreement of sale. Those documents would be prepared by lawyers on both sides."

"The word cash came up in the context of the distinction between financing, which is referenced, and no financing, which means a full payment, a total one-time payment. That's the context in which the word cash is used," he said. "Anyone who knows anything about the company or how the President does business knows there is no green cash. Everything is documented. Every penny is documented."

On the tape Cohen also says, "I've spoken with (Trump Organization chief financial officer) Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up with funding."

Futerfas declined to answer whether the payment would have been from the company or from Trump's personal finances. He said Weisselberg wore two hats working for Trump and his company. "I don't even know what Michael Cohen would have said to Allen Weisselberg because all Allen does is bookkeeping and process requests for transactions that are given to him," Futerfas said.

Court filings said federal prosecutors have obtained 12 audio recordings from the FBI raids on Cohen earlier this year CNN previously reported that Trump's lawyers waived attorney-client privilege on the President's behalf regarding the recording involving him personally.

The audio recording of Trump and Cohen relates to whether Trump should buy the rights of the story from American Media, which paid McDougal $150,000 in August 2016 for her story about an alleged 10 month affair with Trump. The story was never published by AMI.

An attorney for AMI declined to comment Tuesday night.

A spokesman for the US attorney's office in Manhattan, which is investigating Cohen, declined to comment.

In addition to discussing the McDougal payment, Trump and Cohen are overheard running through a list of potential legal issues, including contesting a New York Times request to unseal divorce records from Trump's first wife Ivana as well as more mundane matters such as polling numbers and Trump surrogate Pastor Mark Burns.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is not invited to any of the memorial services for her former running mate, Arizona Sen. John McCain, a source tells CNN.

Palin was rocketed onto the national stage in the summer of 2008 after McCain picked her to be his running mate in the presidential race he would eventually lose to Barack Obama.

Palin mourned McCain in a tweet Saturday night after his death, calling him her "friend."

"Today we lost an American original," Palin tweeted Saturday following McCain's death. "Sen. John McCain was a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs. John never took the easy path in life -- and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self. John McCain was my friend. I will remember the good times. My family and I send prayers for Cindy and the McCain family."

A source close to the Palin family tells CNN: "Out of respect for Sen. McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point. The Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) A majority of Republicans said they believed the news media is "the enemy of the people" rather than "an important part of democracy" in a poll released Tuesday.

The poll from Quinnipiac University showed 51% of GOP respondents identified with President Donald Trump's "enemy of the people" line -- a result that reflected an ongoing partisan breakdown on the validity of the press.

Tuesday's poll showed 36% of GOP respondents called the news media "an important part of democracy," a much smaller share than any other group listed out by Quinnipiac. Only 5% of Democrats and 24% of independents called the news media "the enemy of the people" compared to 91% of Democrats and 65% of independents who said it was "an important part of democracy."

Overall, Tuesday's poll showed 26% of respondents said the news media is "the enemy of the people" and 65% said it is "an important part of democracy," with the remaining 10% saying neither or "don't know."

Quinnipiac took its poll of 1,175 voters from August 9-13 and said the results have a margin of error plus/minus 3.4 percentage points.

__label__world (CNN) Parties fighting a brutal civil war in Yemen have conducted attacks that were "disproportionate" and could be considered war crimes, a United Nations panel of experts announced Tuesday.

Their report, which comes after multiple recent civilian deaths, points to thousands of civilian casualties caused by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes, widespread arbitrary detention, torture, sexual violence and the conscription of children as young as 8 into Yemen's armed forces, all of which are crimes under international law.

All sides are "responsible for a violation of human rights" and crimes "continue to be perpetrated," the report says.

"The violations we have documented were horrendous," said Kamel Jendoubi, chairperson of the Group of International and Regional Eminent Experts on Yemen, the report's authors, at a press conference Tuesday morning.

The Yemen war began in early 2015 when Houthi rebels -- a minority Shia group from the north of the country -- drove out the US-backed government and took over the capital, Sanaa.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Trump administration on Tuesday unveiled a list of roughly $16 billion worth of imports from China that will be hit with 25% tariffs.

will take effect August 23. The move marks the latest escalation of a trade war between the world's two largest economies. The tariffs on 279 product s, including motorcycles, speedometers and antennas,will take effect August 23.

It is the second time the US has slapped tariffs on Chinese goods, despite persistent warnings by American businesses it will raise the price of goods for consumers.

The Trump administration has accused China of unfair trade practices and President Donald Trump has long vowed to bring down the United States' trade deficit in goods with Beijing.

In July, the administration imposed 25% tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports. Beijing, accusing the United States of trade bullying, has retaliated by imposing tariffs on an equal measure of American goods.

__label__politics Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been found guilty on eight counts of financial crimes, a major victory for special counsel Robert Mueller.

But jurors were unable to reach a verdict on 10 charges, and Judge T.S. Ellis declared a mistrial on those counts.

Manafort was found guilty of five tax fraud charges, one charge of hiding foreign bank accounts and two counts of bank fraud. He faces a maximum of 80 years in prison.

The news came at the same time Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen was in a New York federal court to plead guilty to multiple counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud and bank fraud.

Landing in Charleston, West Virginia, Trump said that the charges Manafort was convicted of on Tuesday have "nothing to do with Russian collusion" and criticized Mueller's investigation for arriving at this point.

__label__politics (CNN) Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, claims that then-candidate Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer his campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton, sources with knowledge tell CNN. Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller, the sources said.

Cohen's claim would contradict repeated denials by Trump, Donald Trump Jr., their lawyers and other administration officials who have said that the President knew nothing about the Trump Tower meeting until he was approached about it by The New York Times in July 2017.

Cohen alleges that he was present, along with several others, when Trump was informed of the Russians' offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen's account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources.

To be clear, these sources said Cohen does not have evidence, such as audio recordings, to corroborate his claim, but he is willing to attest to his account.

Cohen privately testified last year to two Congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. A source familiar with Cohen's House testimony said he did not testify that Trump had advance knowledge. Cohen's claims weren't mentioned in separate reports issued by Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.

Contacted by CNN, one of Cohen's attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment.

Trump denied knowledge of the meeting in a tweet Friday morning.

"I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary's lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!" Trump tweeted.

An FBI raid on Cohen's office in April sought information about taxi owners who had financial dealings with Cohen, CNN has reported

Rudy Giuliani, the President's attorney, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on "Cuomo Prime Time" Thursday night that Cohen has "been lying all week, he's been lying for years."

"I don't see how he's got any credibility," Giuliani added.

Giuliani also said Cohen is "the kind of witness that can really destroy your whole case" and called Cohen, who was a top Trump Organization attorney for a decade, a "pathological liar."

"Donald Trump Jr. has been professional and responsible throughout the Mueller and Congressional investigations," said Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Donald Trump Jr. "We are very confident of the accuracy and reliability of the information that has been provided by Mr. Trump, Jr., and on his behalf."

According to people who have discussed the matter with Cohen, he has expressed hope that this claim about the Trump Tower meeting will help him reach out to Mueller and possibly lessen his legal troubles. He's under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in Manhattan after Mueller referred Cohen's case to them.

The June 2016 meeting was arranged after a publicist who knew Trump Jr. told him in emails -- in no uncertain terms -- that a senior Russian official "offered to provide the Trump campaign" with damaging information about Clinton, and that the outreach was "part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump." At the time, the Russian operation to covertly boost Trump's candidacy wasn't publicly known. Trump. Jr. responded, "if it's what you say, I love it," and started to arrange the meeting.

At the meeting, Trump Jr. was joined by his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was Trump's campaign chairman at the time. There were four Russians in the room, including a lawyer with Kremlin ties, a businessman who worked for an oligarch and a lobbyist with old KGB connections.

After news of the meeting broke in July 2017, the Trump team offered misleading explanations and changed their story several times. But one claim stayed consistent: that Trump had no knowledge of the meeting beforehand, wasn't told about it afterward and first learned about it one year later.

Those denials were repeatedly issued by Trump, his attorney Jay Sekulow, Trump Jr., Futerfas and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. Those people denied that Trump had contemporaneous knowledge of the meeting on more than 15 occasions, according to CNN's analysis.

Trump said on July 12, 2017, that he "only heard about it two or three days ago." One week later, Trump repeated that he "didn't know anything about the meeting" because "nobody told me" about it.

Around that same time, CNN's Jake Tapper asked Sekulow to confirm Trump's claims that he only recently learned about the controversial meeting. Sekulow's response: "Yes, I swear."

But perhaps the highest-stakes denial was given by Trump Jr. in his testimony last year to the Senate Judiciary Committee.

"He wasn't aware of it," Trump Jr. told lawmakers, referring to his father's knowledge of the meeting. "And, frankly, by the time anyone was aware of it, which was summer of this year, as I stated earlier, I wouldn't have wanted to get him involved in it because it had nothing to do with him."

Trump's critics have long doubted these denials. They point to a series of phone calls Trump Jr. made to a blocked phone number before and after the meeting. They also note that two days before the meeting, Trump mysteriously announced plans to give a "major speech" about Clinton's scandals. Trump Jr. says he didn't get any dirt at the meeting -- and the speech never happened.

Even Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and top Trump campaign official, said the meeting was "treasonous" and speculated that "the chance that Don Jr. did not walk these (Russians) up to his father's office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero." Trump Jr. has denied Bannon's allegation. Bannon's comments, to author Michael Wolff for his book "Fire and Fury," triggered the bitter public divorce between Bannon and Trump in early 2018.

Axios reported that Bannon does not have first-hand knowledge about whether Trump Jr. told his father, and Bannon later said his "treasonous" remark was directed at Manafort and not Trump Jr.

UPDATE: This story has been updated with more comments from President Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani.
__label__world Story highlights This blood moon was the longest total lunar eclipse of the century

Mars was its brightest Friday and will be closest to Earth on Monday and Tuesday

(CNN) The longest total lunar eclipse of the century concluded Friday night, showcasing a blood moon for most of the Eastern Hemisphere. Coincidentally, Mars was also at its brightest, putting two bright red objects in the sky.

It began in Australia and Indonesia, and it moved across the globe. The lunar eclipse ended around 7:30 p.m. ET. The totality of the lunar eclipse lasted about an hour and 43 minutes, but the partial eclipse before and after the total phase meant the moon spent nearly four hours crossing the Earth's shadow.

The lunar eclipse happened during daylight hours for those in the Western Hemisphere, so people in North America missed it.

Lunar eclipses can occur only during a full moon, and this one was extra special because it was also the blood moon. The moon was in perfect alignment with the sun and Earth on Friday, with the moon on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun.

As the full moon moved into Earth's shadow, it darkened, but it didn't disappear. Sunlight passing through Earth's atmosphere lit the moon in a dramatic fashion, turning it red.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) White House adviser Stephen Miller is pushing to expedite a policy that could penalize legal immigrants whose families receive public benefits and make it more difficult to get citizenship, three sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.

The White House has been reviewing the proposal since March at the Office of Management and Budget, which is the last stop for regulations before they are final. But concerns over potential lawsuits have delayed the final rule, and the draft has undergone numerous revisions, multiple sources say.

The crux of the proposal would penalize legal immigrants if they or their family members have used government benefits -- defined widely in previous drafts of the policy.

The law has long allowed authorities to reject immigrants if they are likely to become a "public charge" -- or dependent on government. But the draft rule in its recent forms would include programs as expansive as health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, as well as some forms of Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit.

The rule would not explicitly prohibit immigrants or their families from accepting benefits. Rather, it authorizes the officers who evaluate their applications for things like green cards and residency visas to count the use of these programs against applicants and gives them authority to deny visas on these grounds -- even if the program was used by a family member.

__label__politics "I made a mistake," Gates testified in his second day on the stand in Manafort's trial. "I regret it, clearly, and I'm taking responsibility for it."

But dubbing it the "secret life of Rick Gates," Manafort's attorney Kevin Downing grilled Gates about the lies he had told and the money he had stolen as part of a strategy to undermine his credibility with the jury and suggest Gates was responsible for the crimes Manafort is accused of.

"This jury is supposed to believe you? After all the lies you've told?" Downing said.

Gates replied that yes, he should be believed over Manafort, the former chairman of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

"I'm here to tell the truth. ... Mr. Manafort had the same path. I'm here," Gates said, looking directly at the jury as he made his appeal. "I have taken responsibility. ... I am trying to change."

The cross-examination came after Gates testified that Manafort sought to move money through offshore accounts and that Manafort had recommended a banker who had loaned him money for a position in the Trump administration.

Manafort is charged with 18 counts of tax and banking crimes, and has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Gates, Manafort's former business partner, pleaded guilty in February and agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's team.

The trial itself is not about the work Manafort did on the Trump campaign. But Gates' testimony pits two former senior Trump campaign aides against each other. After Manafort left the campaign in August 2016 amid swirling questions about his Ukraine work, Gates stayed on the campaign and later helped found a pro-Trump advocacy group, before he was ultimately forced out, too, as questions mounted about Manafort.

'It was an embezzlement from Mr. Manafort'

Manafort's defense attorney dug into Gates about how he had embezzled from Manafort, accusing him of using an offshore bank account that's part of Manafort's alleged crime.

Downing peppered Gates with questions: Was Gates' wife aware of the account he used to siphon money from Manafort? Yes, Gates said. Was she aware of his "secret life"?

"She was," Gates said.

Downing continued to highlight to the jury, and to Gates, how Gates had embezzled from Manafort, though he initially resisted the term.

"Why won't you say embezzlement?" Downing asked.

"What difference does it make?" Gates said, repeated his phrasing that he had submitted "unauthorized" expense reports to Manafort's company.

"Why won't you say embezzlement?" Downing asked a second time.

"It was an embezzlement from Mr. Manafort," Gates finally said.

The intense exchange, where Gates still refrained from showing much emotion, came after the defense lawyer reviewed almost $200,000 Gates had transferred to his own bank account, listed under the holding company Bade LLC, from one of Manafort's shell companies, Global Endeavor.

Gates admitted at this point during the testimony that "it was Mr. Manafort's money."

"Were these payments for your secret life?" Downing asked.

"The answer is no, they're not," Gates said.

'WTF' emails

Earlier Tuesday, prosecutors walked jurors through an email Manafort had sent Gates two weeks after Trump was elected, in which Trump recommended Stephen Calk as Army secretary. Calk is a banker whose bank allegedly loaned Manafort money on false pretenses, prosecutors say.

"We need to discuss Steve Calk for Sec of Army," Manafort wrote to Gates on Nov. 24, 2016. He signed the email as "P."

In his second day of testimony, Gates detailed their use of foreign accounts as well as Manafort's financial troubles.

Prosecutors showed jurors an April 2015 email exchange between Manafort and Gates discussing higher-than-anticipated taxes, which Gates said succinctly summarized the frustration felt by Manafort.

"WTF," Manafort wrote. "How could I be blindsided like this. You told me you were on top of this. We need to discuss options. This is a disaster."

Moving the accounts

Gates told jurors Tuesday that the "typical practice was Mr. Manafort would send me a list of wire requests." Manafort would also send the wire transfer requests to their Cyprus-based law firm, Gates said.

Prosecutors showed emails between Manafort and Gates that appear to confirm Gates' story that Manafort sought to move money that his consulting company had earned from Ukraine through Cypriot accounts.

"There were hundreds of these," Gates testified.

Gates had written to Manafort about transferring money from one of Manafort's shell companies, Leviathan Advisors Limited, to their aboveboard consulting group, DMP International. "Unless you approve otherwise," Gates ended his note proposing the transfer.

"This works. Proceed as you lay it out below," Manafort wrote back, signing his email with the letter "P."

The subject line of the email was "Payments."

At some point during the European banking crisis, Manafort's law firm in Cyprus that oversaw the legal process of setting up the accounts moved them to the country St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean. Around that time, Manafort asked for his name to be removed from the bank account registrations, Gates said. Gates said his name was taken off some but not all legal documents in the foreign country.

Gates said Manafort especially wanted to avoid having his name listed in any documents linked to the accounts because he was embroiled in a lawsuit with someone in Ukraine.

Gates testifies on Manafort's money troubles

Gates described the financial issues that Manafort and his various entities began to experience in 2015 and 2016, describing how vendors would reach out to him and Manafort because "loans had not been paid."

By late 2015, Manafort's consulting group DMP had no clients, according to Gates. He said they were attempting to secure another political consulting contract in Ukraine but had not been able to.

Gates said that during this time he also supplied false information to banks in order to help Manafort secure bank loans. He admitted to altering the profit and loss documents, which he said was per Manafort's direction.

Gates explained how he was hired to work on the Trump campaign, although he did not name Trump. Gates said he was paid for the campaign work through savings and investments from Manafort, though he had additional outside income.

In January 2016 Manafort asked Gates to refinance a property in New York on Howard Street -- a property that Manafort never lived in because he stayed at his Fifth Avenue apartment when he was in the city, but still claimed to use as a second home in order to secure maximum benefits for the mortgage refinance loan, Gates said.

A second email

Another email prosecutors showed and Gates confirmed came in 2015, from the Russian Konstantin Kilimnik to Gates discussing money a Ukrainian client had not yet paid Manafort's firm through the accounts.

At the time, Manafort was dry on cash and beginning to panic, prosecutors say. They have alleged that around this time he was using the hollow foreign accounts to help him reduce the taxes he paid to the US government and defraud at least one bank into giving him a loan.

"This is to calm Paul down," Kilimnik wrote to Gates. "I think the wire will go next week realistically." Gates told the court that "Mr. Manafort was quite upset money had not been sent," and Kilimnik wanted to show the boss they were making the effort.

That contract for 1 million euros, with Ukrainian Sergei Lyovochkin and executed between shell companies both sides used, was never paid in full.

Gates started his testimony Tuesday by getting into the gritty details of how much money each Ukrainian billionaire contracted Manafort for, showcasing exactly how much money was flowing into the hidden Cypriot accounts in 2011 and 2012. It amounted to at least 5 million euros, Gates said.

Working for Manafort, Kilimnik would collect the agreements and execute them, Gates said.

Manafort reported some of the payments to tax authorities in the US as loans -- though they were income, Gates said. He was "trying to decrease his taxable income," Gates said.
__label__politics Michael Cohen was part of President Trump's inner circle for more than a decade, working as his personal attorney at the Trump Organization and continuing to advise the President after the election.

Cohen once said he would take a bullet for Trump, but the relationship between the two men has frayed since an FBI raid in April of Cohen's office, hotel room and home.

Trump has distanced himself from Cohen, who has told friends he has felt isolated, according to the friends. Last month, Cohen told ABC News his loyalty is to his family and country first, not the President.

Why it matters: As part of a plea deal under discussion earlier Tuesday, Cohen was not expected to cooperate with the government, one source told CNN. However, by pleading guilty both Cohen and prosecutors would avoid the spectacle and uncertainty of a trial.

The Cohen investigation was referred to the Southern District of New York by special counsel Robert Mueller. If the plea deal does not include cooperation by Cohen, then it is unclear if he would follow through on his previous assertion to friends, according to sources, that he is willing to talk to Mueller.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) As far as spy craft goes, Maria Butina's skills didn't seem particularly impressive.

The alleged covert Russian agent liked to communicate via Twitter messages and WhatsApp. Her overly flirtatious approach left men wondering what she was truly after. She tended to brag about her ties to Russian intelligence when she was intoxicated, according to people familiar with the situation.

"She's like a Scud missile. There's no precision," said CIA veteran Robert Baer, a CNN intelligence and security analyst.

Butina has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent in the US. Her lawyer, Robert Driscoll, told CNN Wednesday that she wouldn't take a deal from prosecutors if it meant admitting she was a spy.

"If you're not an agent for a foreign government, you can't lie and say you are in order to get rid of this," Driscoll said.

But intelligence experts say Butina's far-from-subtle approach to infiltrating Republican political circles in the US appears to be just one tactic in Moscow's arsenal as Russian President Vladimir Putin aimed to influence American politics and disrupt democracy ahead of the 2016 election. Those efforts are continuing, Trump administration officials say, in the run-up to the midterm elections.

Putin has numerous intelligence services at his disposal. Some excel in hacking. Others churn out seasoned operatives to gather intelligence and quietly recruit Americans. But there are also more informal missions, ones that are often directed by Putin himself with the help of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the KGB's successor.

"It's much less structured," Alina Polyakova, a Russia expert and foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, said of Russia's influence operations. "There often is kind of a proxy lead actor, who is usually an oligarch close to the regime, that is given a project and he outsources portions of that project."

"I almost think of it as project management," Polyakova added.

It also helps shed light on why run-ins between a ragtag assortment of Russians and members of Donald Trump's orbit appeared so random.

In April 2016, a Maltese professor with Kremlin ties informed Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos that the Russians had thousands of damaging emails about Hillary Clinton, according to court records.

A month later, a Russian man who went by Henry Greenberg made a more overt offer to longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone: damaging information on Clinton in exchange for $2 million. Stone has said he believes the offer was part of a law enforcement setup directed at the Trump campaign.

That same month, May of 2016, Butina and her alleged handler, Kremlin-linked banker Alexander Torshin, snagged a brief meet-and-greet with Donald Trump Jr. on the sidelines of the National Rifle Association's annual meeting in Louisville, Kentucky. That was only after her efforts with Torshin to establish back channel communications between candidate Trump and Putin fell short.

By June of 2016, a Russian lawyer met with Trump Jr. and other top Trump campaign officials for the now infamous Trump Tower meeting. The Trump officials believed the lawyer was there to offer dirt on Clinton. The offer was pushed by a Russian billionaire with ties to Putin.

"Everything is not necessarily a planned and highly disciplined intelligence operation," said Steven Hall, a retired CIA chief of Russia operations and a CNN national security analyst. "Sometimes there's these more freelance types of things that also go on."

Efforts to make inroads with the Trump campaign or other right-wing political groups go hand-in-hand with Moscow's more coordinated efforts to hack the Democrats, spread disinformation on social media, sow division and try to sway voters in favor of Trump, according to intelligence experts.

"It's still part of a large tapestry that Vladimir Putin is weaving," Hall said.

A not-so-secret agent?

With distinctive red hair, a fiery personality and an affinity for social media, Butina operated at a higher decibel than one might expect from an alleged covert agent.

In her graduate-level classes at American University -- a cover for work on behalf of the Russian government, according to prosecutors -- Butina vociferously defended Putin. She also claimed, in class, to be a liaison between the Trump campaign and the Russians, according to a person familiar with the situation.

People who met her through school and through political events described her as a little too friendly. She was quick to start playing footsy under the table or sidle up to an older man at a political event and suddenly request that they become friends on Facebook, according to people who knew her.

On at least two separate occasions she got drunk and spoke openly about her contacts within the Russian government, even acknowledging that Russian intelligence services were involved with the gun rights group she ran in Moscow. Twice, classmates reported her actions to law enforcement because they found her comments so alarming, sources said.

In her final months at American University, the FBI raided her apartment. They arrested her in July.

By the time of her arrest, Butina had become the subject of a torrent of news coverage.

"You have upstaged Anna Chapman," Torshin wrote to Butina in March 2017, offering compliments for some of the initial media coverage she received and comparing her to a Russian intelligence official who was arrested in 2010 as part of a spy ring operating in the US. "She poses with toy pistols, while you are being published with real ones," the Russian official wrote, according to court documents.

"It's better to keep a low profile now," Butina wrote later in the conversation, according to court documents.

But the under-the-radar approach never seemed to suit Butina.

Before moving to the US for school, she was featured in a 2014 Russian GQ spread, wielding two handguns and sporting Dolce & Gabbana briefs, a leather trench and stilettos.

On a visit to the US in July 2015, she attended a political event in Las Vegas, identified herself as a visitor from Russia and asked then-candidate Trump whether he would pursue sanctions against her homeland.

Then, she documented the encounter on social media, a pattern she followed when she attended NRA events and met politicians including former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who all ran for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Santorum is now a CNN contributor.

There's little hint Butina had the same type of formal training as Chapman.

Chapman's colleagues used fake names and had carefully crafted fake identities. They used invisible ink, hid data in images that were posted on public websites and sent Morse-code style messages using radio transmitters to communicate, according to court documents.

Butina, meanwhile, ran a years-long influence operation that involved communicating regularly via email and Twitter messages, according to prosecutors.

"Most Russian spies don't communicate by Twitter direct messages which are unencrypted," Driscoll has said, while arguing his client's innocence.

But as Torshin's round of plaudits suggests, Butina's noisy way of doing business probably didn't make her any less valuable to the Russian government, intelligence experts said. In fact, her high-profile contacts probably caught the attention of the FSB and led them to believe her mission was more successful than they had initially hoped, experts said.

"I think that anyone who is Russian has to meet with the FSB when they go back and forth and frequently," Butina's lawyer said in a previous CNN interview. Russians are often asked "what they're doing in America, if they had any information for the FSB," Driscoll said. "I think those kind of things were discussed by her."

Traditional tradecraft focuses on stealing defense secrets. But understanding American culture and how to undermine it is increasingly valuable to countries like Russia and their efforts to disrupt US democracy.

"Access to human beings is hard to replicate," said Philip Mudd, a veteran of the CIA and the FBI and a CNN counterterrorism analyst. "Human beings can shortcut, 'What's their plan going into the next election. What do they talk about?'"

By the time she was arrested, Butina had leveraged her romantic relationship with a Republican operative from South Dakota, Paul Erickson, to build connections in GOP circles, according to prosecutors. Erickson hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing.

"Eventually Russians are going to need people on the ground here -- whether they're witting or unwitting Americans -- to help them with their propaganda operations," said Hall, the retired CIA chief of Russia. "There's probably a lot now and there's probably going to be a lot more."

When investigators executed searches on Butina and Erickson's homes, court documents reveal a note that investigators found in Erickson's handwriting: "how to respond to FSB offer of employment?"

It's unclear which of them it was for.

__label__world (CNN) The sea ice off the coast of northern Greenland is normally some of the thickest in the entire Arctic, with ridges of ice piled as high as 70 feet in some places.

And despite the rapid retreat of sea ice across the region due to climate change, this harsh corner of the globe was expected to be the last to retain year-round sea ice cover.

But recent satellite imagery shows that some of the Arctic's oldest ice has been replaced by miles of open water for the first time on record, surprising scientists and ice monitors.

"This was the area that was seen as the last bastion, where we'd see these changes come last, but they've arrived," said Walt Meier, a senior research scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

How the breakup happened

Sea ice off of northern Greenland is much thicker than elsewhere in the Arctic because, according to Meier, as ice drifts across the Arctic from Siberia, it is compacted against Greenland's rugged coast.

But this year has shown that even the densest sea ice is not impervious to high temperatures.

In late February and early March, summerlike heat and winds out of the south resulted in a similar ice breakup in the region.

"We saw this occur first earlier this year ... which is really particularly unusual in the sense that it was still winter there, so it's generally very cold."

Keld Qvistgaard, a senior ice adviser with the Greenland Ice Service, says it's possible that the current breakup is connected to the one that appeared in February. But the current melt is far more extensive than what was spotted in late winter, and much larger than he's ever seen before.

Satellite imagery captured on August 21, 2018, shows the unprecedented retreat of sea ice off the northern coast of Greenland.

"In this case, [the open water is] 20-30 miles wide and goes all the way from the northeast off Greenland to the northern tip, and even further west," Qvistgaard said. "I've been in this business for 26 years and I don't recall that I've seen a breakup this big."

What this means for the future of the Arctic

Though the current sea ice breakup is unprecedented, Meier and Qvistgaard stressed that this is only a single event in a relatively small geographic area.

But it is in line with other changes to ice cover that scientists have observed in the region.

"It really is another indication of the changed Arctic, an Arctic that is covered by more seasonal ice -- ice that melts away every summer, thinner ice cover and a more mobile ice cover," Meier said.

In general, the loss of sea ice does have implications for the global climate.

As sea ice melts, sunlight entering the atmosphere that would normally be reflected back into space is instead absorbed by the dark blue of the open ocean , further heating the water and the surrounding air. This kick-starts a vicious cycle, resulting in even more melting of sea ice and ocean heat absorption.

"Long-term, it's clear that the ice is more broken up and thinner and weaker, so this is probably going to happen again at least from time to time. How often? It's hard to say," Meier said. "This will still probably be the last area to lose ice completely during the summer, but it's more vulnerable than we had previously thought."

Paul Begala says McCain's VP choice, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, is completely unqualified to be president.

(CNN) -- John McCain needs what Kinky Friedman calls "a checkup from the neck up."

In choosing Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate, he is not thinking "outside the box," as some have said. More like out of his mind.

Palin a first-term governor of a state with more reindeer than people, will have to put on a few pounds just to be a lightweight. Her personal story is impressive: former fisherman, mother of five. But that hardly qualifies her to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.

For a man who is 72 years old and has had four bouts with cancer to have chosen someone so completely unqualified to become president is shockingly irresponsible. Suddenly, McCain's age and health become central issues in the campaign, as does his judgment.

In choosing this featherweight, McCain passed over Tom Ridge, a decorated combat hero, a Cabinet secretary and the former two-term governor of the large, complex state of Pennsylvania. iReport.com: 'McCain pick might be a gimmick'

He passed over Mitt Romney, who ran a big state, Massachusetts; a big company, Bain Capital; and a big event, the Olympics.

He passed over Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Texas senator who is knowledgeable about the military, good on television and -- obviously -- a woman.

He passed over Joe Lieberman, his best friend in the Senate and fellow Iraq Kool-Aid drinker.

He passed over former congressman, trade negotiator and budget director Rob Portman.

And he also passed over Mike Huckabee, the governor of Arkansas.

For months, the McCainiacs have said they will run on his judgment and experience. In his first presidential decision, John McCain has shown that he is willing to endanger his country, potentially leaving it in the hands of someone who simply has no business being a heartbeat away from the most powerful, complicated, difficult job in human history.

__label__world (CNN) Australian police are seeking around a dozen suspected asylum seekers believed to be hiding in a crocodile-infested rainforest after their boat ran aground near Port Douglas in Queensland.

Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton confirmed Monday that "Australia has received the first vessel, the first people smuggling venture in over 1,400 days," adding there was an "operation underway" to locate the migrants, believed to be from Vietnam.

Around 15 of those who were on board the boat have been detained by border force officers, Queensland Police Minister Mark Ryan told reporters , but a similar number are believed to be seeking refuge in the Daintree rainforest, an area of dense mangroves known to be infested with salt-water crocodiles.

The arrival of a migrant vessel on the Australian mainland is a dramatic failure of the country's expensive and highly criticized zero-tolerance "stop the boats" immigration policy.

It also comes just days after the man responsible for that policy -- Scott Morrison -- became Australian Prime Minister , after turfing out his predecessor Malcolm Turnbull in an inter-party battle.

'Open air prisons'

Australia has long been an attractive destination for those in Asia and beyond seeking refuge from conflict, poverty and political repression.

Under successive conservative governments, the country has passed hardline policies designed to dissuade asylum seekers from making the often dangerous water crossing from Southeast Asia to northern Australia.

Following the 2013 election, the ruling Liberal-National Coalition -- with Morrison as Minister for Immigration and Border Protection -- launched Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB), vowing to "stop the boats."

Since then, the number of asylum seekers arriving in the Australian mainland by boat has fallen from a peak in 2013 of 20,587 to zero, according to a parliamentary research paper released last year

A group of Chinese nationals landed on Sabai Island , about 150 kilometers (93 miles) north of the Australian mainland close to Papua New Guinea, in August 2017.

The suspected asylum seekers are believed to have come ashore in heavily wooded north Queensland.

While no asylum seekers have made it to mainland since OSB launched, they have not gone away. Since 2012, the Australian government has intercepted boats headed to Australia and moved migrants to offshore detention camps on the Pacific nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea.

Under international law , people seeking asylum are guaranteed certain rights and protections, but in most cases may only make a claim on landing in the country they are attempting to gain refugee status in. By preventing asylum seekers from reaching Australia, Canberra effectively dodges these obligations.

Detainees within offshore the camps are banned from being settled on the Australian mainland, leaving many without any alternative but remaining in what have been described as " open air prisons ."

Last week, a 12-year-old boy was airlifted to Australia for medical attention after refusing food and water for weeks. A 2016 United Nations report found many cases of "attempted suicide, self-immolation, acts of self-harm and depression" among children detained on Nauru.

According to UNICEF , the operation has also been hugely costly to the Australian taxpayer, running up a bill of at least $7 billion (9.6 billion AUD) "between 2013 and 2016 in maintaining offshore processing, onshore mandatory detention and boat turn-backs."

'Should be sent to Nauru'

Steve Ciobo, the recently named Defense Industry Minister, told CNN affiliate Sky News Australia Monday the suspected asylum seekers "should be taken into custody ... and they should be sent to Nauru."

"They should be sent somewhere offshore if we're able to do it under our international obligations," he added. "They should not be allowed to stay in Australia. We may not be able to do that under conventions, we'll have to have a look at it."

David Manne, executive director of the Refugee Legal, said that "at the very time that Australia should be trying to resolve the plight of so many people who have been marooned in Nauru and (Papua New Guinea) ... we should not be compounding this humanitarian crisis by exiling more people there."

Under international law, Australia is obligated to process asylum seekers without exposing them to additional harm, which Manne said would inevitably occur if they were sent to offshore camps.

"If these people are seeking asylum Australia should honor its obligations under the Refugee Convention by processing and providing protection to them in Australia instead of sending them into indefinite exile and inevitable anguish," he said.

Key Liberal policy

While Australia's hardline migrant policies have been roundly criticized by rights groups and international bodies, they remain a point of pride for the ruling Liberal Party.

On the Liberal Party's website, recently revamped under new leader Morrison, " securing Australia's borders " is listed as an achievement of the Coalition government.

"It has been over three years without a boat arrival," the website still said Monday. "We have turned around Labor's failure and taken back control of our borders from the people smugglers."

Both Morrison and his challenger in last weeks Liberal party leadership battle, Peter Dutton, built their reputations on anti-migrant policies.

Dutton was returned to Morrison's cabinet Monday as Home Affairs Minister, however, a separate Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs was also named, shifting certain powers from a ministry under Turnbull that was seen as growing too powerful.

Manne said, due to the uncertain political situation, it was unclear what effect the changed would have on migration policy, but that "successive governments have locked themselves into a deterrence policy where protection of borders has been prioritized over the protection of people."

"In the last five years, Australia has spent billions of dollars to exile and indefinitely incarcerate and ultimately destroy thousands of people that it is morally and legally duty bound to protect," he said.
__label__world Rome (CNN) Mourners remembered 18 of the victims of the deadly bridge collapse in the northern Italian city of Genoa at a joint state funeral service on Saturday that was reportedly boycotted by some families amid anger against the government.

At least 43 people died when a section of the Morandi Bridge -- a vital link of the A10 highway that connects northwest Italy to France and one of the busiest bridges in Italy -- suddenly plummeted to the ground on Tuesday.

President Sergio Materella, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, and Vice Prime ministers Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio were among the politicians to attend the funeral service at a convention center in the city, led by the city's archbishop, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco.

Each of the 18 coffins -- including one small, white one for a child -- was decorated with mounds of flowers. Families and survivors sat by the caskets, many of which also had a photo of the victim.

Mourners gave a standing ovation as a number of first responders, in uniform, arrived for the service. Many of them stopped to kiss the coffins as they passed by. Those gathered also applauded when the names of the dead were read out.

(CNN) There was a jarring sense of déjà vu last week in Canada as images of yet another attack on innocent civilians in Toronto played out on newscasts. A reportedly mentally ill man went on a gun rampage on Sunday evening in Toronto's popular Danforth neighborhood, killing two people and injuring 13 others. The attack occurred less than three months after a man drove a van into pedestrians in another busy part of Toronto, killing 10 people.

And those were just in 2018. In January 2017, in Quebec City, a man using a restricted firearm killed six people and injured others. And in September of that year, in Edmonton, a man carried out a stabbing and van attack, injuring five.

According to Toronto police , up to half of the guns on the streets of Toronto are smuggled in from the US, and the Canada Border Services Agency is routinely seizing illegal firearms at the Canada-US border. ( Media reports say the semi-automatic handgun used in last week's Sunday shooting originated in the US, although Canadian-sourced illegal firearms arms are a big part of police seizures as well).

And these stories are not just anecdotal. According to the Canadian government, the number of homicide victims killed by firearms has been steadily increasing over the last three years. With gun violence on the rise in North America's fourth-largest city, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau must now contend with growing calls for a crackdown on guns in Canada where, unlike in the US, people do not have a constitutional right to bear arms.

The surge in violence on Canadian streets adds to the list of issues Trudeau is going to have to deal with as he prepares for a federal election next year. Just three years into his mandate, the photogenic Trudeau must juggle a host of controversies that have hurt his popularity. Introducing a possible handgun ban in response to the violence and adding a new post for "border security and organized crime reduction" in a cabinet shuffle on July 18 are some of the ways Trudeau is getting battle ready.

But it will take more than that. With his protracted honeymoon over, Trudeau must project himself less as a Prime Minister known for viral selfies and more as a decisive leader willing to stand up to external threats. That may require a shakeup of his own team to prioritize issues management and damage control.

His focus should be on what he can control, starting with curbing the flow of migrants crossing into Canada. Ottawa is also under growing pressure from provincial premiers and big city mayors who say they are overwhelmed with the burden of caring for new migrants who can languish for years as they grind their way through Canada's notoriously clogged immigration processing system. Last year alone, more than 20,000 "irregular" asylum seekers were intercepted by police along the US-Canada border. These are individuals who have either transited through the US or have already claimed asylum in the US and use a loophole to cross into Canada where the chances of staying are much higher (all the while receiving such benefits as free health care, shelter and work permits).

Little of what the government has done so far has plugged the loophole, and if the northward flow continues, the Trudeau government could be forced to make the entire border off limits to those who don't use official crossings. Although images of distressed asylum seekers from Nigeria and Haiti may not play well on TV in an election season, cracking down on what some Canadians regard as queue jumpers would have little political downside.

Tough language, a cabinet shuffle and making Canadians feel safer. But with just a little over a year to go before voters head to the polls, is this too little, too late?

Recent public opinion polls seem to indicate a bumpy road ahead for Trudeau, who came into office at 43 with little political experience but good looks, charm and a weighty legacy as the son of Pierre Trudeau, Canada's third-longest serving prime minister.

According to CBC's poll tracker , which incorporates several public opinion surveys, with a spread of less than 1%, if an election were held today, the Liberals would either be defeated or end up with a minority government.

Considering that in 2015 the Liberals achieved the largest-ever seat gain in a Canadian election, the plunge in popularity is nothing short of stunning.

Many trace the pivot point back to the Prime Minister's disastrous week-long, state visit to India last February, when he was widely ridiculed for dressing his entire family in traditional Indian attire. (As Sun Media's Adrienne Batra put it , the India visit featured more wardrobe changes than a Cher concert). Further damage came first from revelations that a convicted terrorist, Jaspal Atwal, had been invited to two events with the Prime Minister, and then from suggestions from an official in Ottawa that factions in the Indian government had sabotaged Trudeau's visit.

With an election on the horizon, the disastrous India visit is expected to make for explosive campaign ammunition. "The Tories will play and re-play the India trip dress-up that went down very badly. The lesson being, don't combine family trips with state visits," said Colin Robertson, a former diplomat and vice president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute

But also looming in the background, and considered by pundits as legitimate election fodder, are groping allegations against Trudeau from 18 years ago that have just become public and which many feel have been insufficiently addressed by the Liberal leader, who's branded himself as a fierce defender of women, even booting a Liberal MP from the cabinet for allegedly calling a woman "yummy" almost a decade ago. Having raised the ethical bar so high, and yet possibly unable to live up to his own standards, the gap will almost certainly be played by political opponents as evidence of hypocrisy. As for Trudeau, he has gone on the record saying he has no recollections of the incident but added, "I respect the fact that someone else might have experienced that differently."

Then there is a questionable environmental record, damaged by the government's billion dollar bailout of a controversial pipeline that would bring oil from Alberta, via British Columbia, to Pacific Ocean ports. The nationalization of the US energy firm Kinder Morgan's pipeline has already generated heated protests in BC and has called into question Trudeau's green credentials. And it could get worse -- a lot worse -- should environmental activists and aboriginal groups block construction bulldozers. Ottawa political analyst Yaroslav Baran told me "At the end of the day, if there are First Nations protesters chained to the pipeline right of way, Mr. Trudeau won't have the guts to send in the army to remove them."

But, as Canadians prepare for the next election, Trudeau may benefit from an unlikely source: President Donald Trump. In the past weeks, the Trump team has mercilessly taunted Trudeau and rallied against Canada for everything from unfair trade practices to disagreements at the G7 summit in Quebec. Trudeau has been fiercely standing up for Canada -- or donning the "Captain Canada hat" as Baran puts it -- which in turn has been giving him a slight boost in the polls.

And with every anti-Canada or anti-Trudeau tweet, it's the gift that could keep on giving for the Trudeau camp. "The federal government's firm but polite pushback against an increasingly combative Donald Trump on the international stage is playing well politically for the Trudeau government," said Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute of Vancouver.

But, as she and others pointed out, if job layoffs, especially in the auto sector, start to occur as a result of the trade disputes, the going could get really tough for the Trudeau government. He may need to get relief from punitive tariffs from Trump -- similar to what the EU achieved last week -- all the while shoring up the Canadian economy against growing competition from a super-charged US economy.
__label__world (CNN) A series of explosions was reported late Saturday in al-Mazzeh, the location of a large military airport near Damascus.

The private, pro-regime news outlet al-Mayadeen originally reported that Israeli airstrikes hit the airbase near Damascus with multiple missiles. However, Syrian state media later cited an unnamed military source denying the base was hit by Israel.

The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) and Syria state television reported a "military source denies the exposure of the Mazzeh Airport to any Israeli aggression and the sounds of explosions that were heard resulted from explosion of an ammunition depot near the airport because of electrical failure."

About four explosions were heard coming from the direction of the military airport Saturday, a Damascus resident told CNN.

"I assume it was from an airstrike because of the explosions afterwards and ambulances with firefighters that went to the scene," the resident said.

__label__world Beijing (CNN) China's top drug control body has hit back at recent claims by US President Donald Trump that Chinese suppliers are fueling America's opioid crisis.

Yu Haibin, a senior official with China's National Narcotics Control Commission, said in a press briefing Wednesday that Trump's comments were "unacceptable" and "irresponsible."

Trump tweeted last week that it was "outrageous" that China-produced fentanyl, a cheap and deadly synthetic opioid at least 50 times stronger than heroin, continued to "pour into the US" through international mail.

Yu said the Chinese government found Trump's tweet "completely unacceptable."

"The United States has no proof that most fentanyl in the country comes from China," he said. "It's highly irresponsible to draw such a conclusion based on some individual cases."

__label__politics (CNN) The driver killed in a head-on collision involving South Carolina congressional candidate Katie Arrington had a blood alcohol level nearly twice the legal limit.

The updated traffic collision report released Wednesday by the Charleston County Sheriff's Office showed that the driver, Helen White, 69, had a blood alcohol level of .153%. The legal limit for blood alcohol concentration in all states is .08%.

White was killed on impact after her car hit the vehicle carrying Arrington, 47, in the passenger seat and her friend Jacqueline Goff, 59, who was driving, on the night of June 22. Both parties were traveling down Highway 17 near the community of Adams Run, though White was traveling in the wrong direction on the highway.

In an interview on Fox News' "Fox and Friends" Friday morning, Arrington asked for thoughts and prayers for White's family.

"They're dealing with a tremendous loss as well," she said. "But I think this is something we need to be cognizant and aware of, drunk driving kills one in three in traffic accidents in South Carolina.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Multiple members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus say they are "uncomfortable" with the scrutiny growing around whether Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio turned a blind eye to alleged abuse, but those conservatives are taking a "wait and see" approach for the time being, according to one source Monday who is familiar with their thinking.

"The members are taking a wait and see approach," the Republican source told CNN. "They aren't making any judgments on him yet."

The source said Jordan's relationships within the House Freedom Caucus are strong, with his colleagues seeing him as a "good man who was probably just in a bad situation." Jordan, a co-founder of the conservative group, is among the high-profile House Republicans considering a run to replace Speaker Paul Ryan when he retires at the end of his term.

However, there is an acknowledgment that some caucus members are skittish about putting their necks on the line without yet knowing the full story of what happened at Ohio State University.

"It was expressed to me by one member that after Joe Paterno, you never want to go too deep in defending somebody, because you can have somebody who was just almost seen as an otherworldly figure of integrity and then you find out that 'Wow, he really did know more than we thought he did. He really didn't do what he should have done,'" the source told CNN. "And I think that is always going to taint these kind of situations."

__label__world (CNN) The International Space Station's cabin pressure is holding steady after crews repaired a leak on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft attached to the orbital complex, Russia's space agency said Friday.

Roscosmos' executive director of manned programs, Sergei Krikalyov, said that the seal was "proving to be completely airtight," after teams isolated and plugged a hole of about two millimeters in diameter. The crew was never in danger, according to NASA.

"At night, tests were held and the pressure was monitored for a lengthy period of time. Right now, the pressure is stable and no further leaks have been detected," Krikalyov told state-run news agency TASS.

The Soyuz spacecraft is one of three spaceships currently docked at the space station.

__label__politics (CNN) A federal judge called the Trump administration's slowness to track down migrant parents it had separated from their children and then deported "unacceptable," saying the responsibility is "100%" on the government.

The stern admonishment from District Judge Dana Sabraw came a day after the administration argued that immigrant advocacy groups -- not the government -- should be responsible for tracking down the more than 500 parents it had separated from their children at the border and deported without them.

Sabraw said during a Friday phone hearing that if the government doesn't track down the parents, it will have "permanently orphaned" their children.

"The reality is there are still close to 500 parents that have not been located, many of these parents were removed from the country without their child, all of this is the result of the government's separation and then inability and failure to track and reunite," Sabraw said.

"And the reality is that for every parent who is not located, there will be a permanent orphaned child, and that is 100% the responsibility of the administration," he added.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) An FBI official said Wednesday the bureau has not found any evidence to back up a claim made by a conservative news organization and spread by President Donald Trump that Hillary Clinton's private email server was hacked by a Chinese-owned company.

"The FBI has not found any evidence the servers were compromised," the official told CNN and other media outlets Wednesday.

The Daily Caller reported late Tuesday that an unnamed Chinese firm operating in the Washington, DC, area hacked Clinton's private server and obtained "nearly all her emails." Trump quickly seized on the report to call on federal law enforcement to investigate the matter. The report that Trump was using cited two anonymous sources briefed on the matter, though Trump himself said hours later on Twitter that stories based on anonymous sources are "fiction."

In one tweet, the President also made light of Russia's attacks on the 2016 US election.

"Report just out: 'China hacked Hillary Clinton's private Email Server.' Are they sure it wasn't Russia (just kidding!)? What are the odds that the FBI and DOJ are right on top of this? Actually, a very big story. Much classified information!" Trump wrote Tuesday night.

(CNN) Earlier this month, I attended the Unite the Right 2 rally in Washington, DC -- a gathering of white nationalists to mark the anniversary of last year's horrific violence in Charlottesville. Afterward, as a dense blue string of thunderstorms rolled in from the south, drenching everything, I found myself thinking about a quote by the late David Foster Wallace: "How do you promote democracy when you know that a majority of people will, if given the chance, vote for an end to democratic voting?"

It was from Wallace's " Borges on the Couch ," an essay about, among other things, Argentinian politics under Juan Perón, 20th-century populism, and the beguiling fragility of open societies.

This is America in 2018. The United States is being led by someone who openly defends white supremacists. Who calls the free press " the enemy of the people ." Who abuses the power of his office to attack and silence his critics. Already, his campaign machinery for the next presidential election is kicking into gear. We're about to come face-to-face with Wallace's complication: To support Trump and similar politicians could very well amount to casting a ballot in favor of dismantling the core electoral safeguards that allow such votes to be cast in the first place.

The rally itself turned out to be a flop. In retrospect, the biggest controversy to emerge from the weekend of protests and counterprotests had to do with an event that took place two days before the rally was scheduled to begin.

For nearly seven minutes, Kessler answered questions in a halting tone. "I'm trying to explain it to you and you're not listening," he replied when King called him out for claiming that his First Amendment rights had been suppressed ( not a new tactic ).

From there he grew less coherent. "You don't even know anything about my rally," he said. "You're going based on left-wing rumor mills."

To which King responded: "I'm citing the National Park Service, sir."

Eventually, Kessler fell into a rant on the biologic superiority of white men and women, arguing that it was "just a matter of science" that "Hispanic people and black people" ranked lower in intelligence. In conclusion, he lamented, "There's really no place where it's OK for me to speak."

Almost immediately, across social media and in traditional venues , both NPR and King came under heavy criticism and sharp questioning for conducting and airing the interview in the first place. What might they have done to provide more context? How should the independent press responsibly report on individuals like Kessler without supplying equal weight to their racist, hate-filled perspectives?

NPR said in a statement that interviewing people "does not mean NPR is endorsing one view over another." On Twitter, King explained , "I'm a biracial woman... Morning Edition is a notably diverse team who thought long and hard before airing this."

To be sure, these accusations and responses deserve attention. But considering our current political climate, in which outrage occludes so much else, it's also important to refocus the discussion back on Kessler for an entirely different reason: what his fascism portends for the rest of us.

JUST WATCHED Aide with white nationalist ties has left WH Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Aide with white nationalist ties has left WH 02:10

Jason Kessler is not a victim. Instead, in his convoluted play for legitimacy, he openly threatens the rights of American citizens he believes inferior. To put it bluntly: Any individuals who advocate for white supremacy in the mainstream media -- seeking, in the process, to pervert our longstanding, if flawed, presumption of a shared objective reality into a blatantly false equivalency -- are openly and knowingly participating in the destruction of democracy itself.

I know that sounds extreme, and fair enough. But let's not split hairs . The overthrow of participatory democracy has been the overt goal of white supremacy from the very start. As such, for anyone advocating that ideology, racism is as much a means as an end, since it's only when the inherent rights of minority citizens are completely revoked -- to a degree more extreme than Jim Crow or even slavery -- that America will finally become an autocratic government powerful enough to enforce the uncompromising purity these supremacists so desperately seek.

Which brings us back to the controversy over the rally and the NPR interview. How should the rest of the Republic (the majority of American citizens... hopefully ), interpret and respond to far-right movements that, from the start, make no apologies about their intent to hijack the "the American idea," as David Foster Wallace described it

What we're talking about now is really just another version of the quote from Wallace's essay on Borges: that deep-seated contradiction that our slavery-condoning participatory democracy was intentionally founded upon, a gap between reality and idealism in which the necessary rationales for the Republic's beginning and end—for its existence and destruction—have, over the last two centuries, managed to simultaneously reside.

It's something that Charles P. Pierce, reflecting on the anniversary of Charlottesville, summed up perfectly : "I am so free that I insist that my freedom includes the freedom to deny you yours."

In other words, we've been living from the very start with the dread that a rally like Kessler's inherently evokes: a self-destruct button built into the dead center of the American steering wheel -- at the exact spot we'd all expected the horn to be -- and with each passing moment the likelihood of us pressing it, whether intentionally or not, increases. The flaw, after all, is right there in the design.

In the face of such odds, there are no easy answers, or even—and this is a distinct possibility—correct ones. Instead we're left with a delimiting set of choices, the revolutionary paradox that, as Adam Gopnik writes, "you have to restrain your own freedom of self-expression in order to recognize the liberty of someone else."

In one of his last published essays -- from 2007, just ten months before his death -- Wallace would go on to write: "Are some things still worth dying for? Is the American idea one such thing?...Have we actually become so selfish and scared that we don't even want to consider whether some things trump safety? What kind of future does that augur?"

Last year, in response to the violence in Charlottesville, our 45th president used the tactic of false equivalency to compare Heather Heyer , the young woman murdered that weekend, to the sort of man who'd killed her. "Some good people on both sides," he famously asserted to reporters in Manhattan. "I think there's blame on both sides."

He was, as is his style , being racist. But like Kessler, he was also articulating a means to an end.

And now, as his standing worsens and the multiple investigations into his possible crimes accelerate, Donald Trump is running out of options. Can the American Idea survive the onslaught of racial demagoguery he's likely to unleash, in the coming weeks and months, as a last-ditch effort to rally together the worst among us and save himself?

Whether we like it or not, Donald Trump is steering the country into the future. And as the rest of us watch on in disbelief, the odds that he'll somehow avert disaster and keep his wandering hands to himself grow slimmer and slimmer with each passing day.

(CNN) There's a great tradition of farewell addresses in American life, usually written by departing presidents saying goodbye to our nation after their terms in office.

But Sen. John McCain, a man whose patriotic stature rivals and even exceeds many presidents, issued his farewell address in a letter read two days after his death by his long-time aide Rick Davis. As emotional as it was for Davis to read, it was equally poignant for those of us who admired McCain to listen to.

As with all farewell addresses, it offered a distillation of hard-won wisdom from his life in war and peace.

George Washington's Farewell Address is the first and perhaps still most iconic leave-taking in American history and established a tradition that McCain followed by instinct.

Washington's Farewell begins with an expression of gratitude to his "friends and fellow citizens" for a lifetime of service, an admission of having made mistakes and an expression of hope that those mistakes are outweighed by his attempt to serve our nation with honor.

__label__politics The eye-popping figures summed up a key portion of the prosecution's case following the conclusion of Manafort deputy Rick Gates' dramatic three-day testimony, during which he detailed how he and Manafort had 15 undisclosed foreign bank accounts and had falsified financial documents. He also admitted to stealing money from Manafort and having one extramarital affair.

Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, is charged with 18 counts of tax and banking crimes and has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Gates' testimony is among the most important of the trial -- pitting the longtime right-hand man against his boss face-to-face for the first time publicly since Gates flipped in February and pleaded guilty to conspiracy and lying to investigators. Since then, Gates has assisted special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

FBI forensic accountant Morgan Magionos brought Manafort's fashion tastes back to the spotlight.

He showed jurors how the FBI had painstakingly traced wire transfers from foreign bank accounts to retailers in the US who sold Manafort expensive goods -- including the custom men's clothier Alan Couture, where Manafort bought jackets made of ostrich and python skin that each cost five figures.

And IRS agent Michael Welch said Manafort used his foreign income for purchases that included a yacht, horseback riding, Italian villa rental and cosmetic dentistry.

The additional purchases cited during Welch's testimony included $132,000 for the business International Yacht Collection, $45,000 for a cosmetic dentist north of Palm Beach. He made other payments to an Italian villa vacation home rental agency and a horseback riding academy in New Jersey.

Gates' credibility on trial

The heart of Manafort's defense is to undermine Gates' credibility with the jury and pin the blame on him for Manafort's alleged crimes, and his attorney implied Wednesday morning that Gates has more to hide.

Manafort's attorney Kevin Downing asked whether Gates had four extramarital affairs -- and not just one abroad 10 years ago -- implying that Gates might have lied to special counsel Robert Mueller's team and could put his plea deal in jeopardy.

The question was cut off and Judge T.S. Ellis had a private conversation with the attorneys, out of earshot of the jury. Downing had said he wanted to ask the question because it spoke to whether Gates had lied to Mueller's office, and whether Gates' plea agreement would still be valid.

But Downing wasn't able to re-ask Gates about four extramarital affairs. Instead, he asked Gates more broadly: "Does your secret life span over many years?"

Gates responded yes. "I made many mistakes over many years," he said.

Gates' previous testimony underscored how much Gates knew about Manafort's wire transfers and the lies other witnesses have said Manafort told the IRS, tax preparers and his bookkeeper. But Gates' testimony also revealed he was a deeply disreputable co-conspirator as Manafort's underling.

Gates served as a deputy for Manafort's political consulting business, and then as his deputy on the Trump campaign in 2016. While Trump has not played a significant role in the trial, Gates testified on Tuesday that after the election, Manafort recommended a banker who had loaned him money to be Trump's Army secretary.

Prosecutor Greg Andres asked Gates on Wednesday whether Mueller's team had told him how to answer questions.

"The only answer I was told was to tell the truth," Gates replied.

Andres also revisited the embezzlement Gates committed against Manafort. Previously, Gates revealed to the court and to the Special Counsel's Office that he had stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from Manafort out of the foreign accounts when he faked expense reports. Andres prompted Gates to point out where the money came from that he had stolen.

"The Ukrainians," Gates said, adding a layer to his statement Tuesday that he had stolen "Mr. Manafort's money."

Signing foreign documents

Manafort attorney Richard Westling also attempted to sow doubt in Magionos's testimony regarding the authenticity of the Manafort signature on various documents that were presented.

"We can't say sitting here today who signed Mr. Manafort's name to the Cyprus bank accounts," Westling said to Magionos.

She confirmed that she did not know who signed his name, only that she has to rely on documents provided by the financial institutions. At one point during this signature comparing exercise, Magionos observed, "It looks a bit different, but I'm also not a hand-writing expert."

While some of the documents shown in court Wednesday listed Manafort's and Gates' names, others showed how a Cypriot law firm run by "Dr. K," Kypros Chrysostomides, oversaw Manafort's foreign accounts.

Prosecutors revealed in court two emails Manafort had sent telling others they would receive payments from the foreign accounts.

Funds "should be in your account today. Coming from Global Endeavor LTD," Manafort wrote to one person, citing one of the foreign accounts that his defense has tried to distance him from in the trial.

In another email, Manafort told Dr. K's law firm to make five wire transfers to pay for thousands of dollars worth of clothing from Alan Couture. "Pls (sic) make the five transfers listed below from the Leviathan account and confirm to me when completed," Manafort wrote.

Prosecution, judge clash again

Ellis and Andres continued to butt heads Wednesday, after Ellis once again reminded the prosecutors they should wrap their case quickly.

"As a concession to the shortness of life, we need to get it done," Ellis said, after Andres implored him to allow the prosecutors to show the jury documents an FBI agent reviewed. "Now we need to bring it to a close, and it's lunchtime."

Andres said his side has focused sharply on the accusations they need to prove. The jury had not yet returned to the courtroom.

__label__politics (CNN) A federal court's rejection of North Carolina's GOP-rigged congressional district map has thrown in doubt 13 voting districts just months before the November midterm elections, along with prospects for the Republican and Democratic parties in the state and perhaps even the full US House of Representatives.

But one thing was clear: The judges who declared the state's partisan gerrymander unconstitutional on Monday adopted the roadmap of liberal Supreme Court justices over the sentiment of conservatives in the high court's recent political redistricting battle.

The three-judge panel's reliance on an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan -- which Chief Justice John Roberts had tried to undercut in the case last June -- represents a victory for challengers to partisan gerrymanders.

It could embolden other judges who increasingly confront maps that were produced by sophisticated software and voter patterns to ensure that a single party prevails and election outcomes are essentially a foregone conclusion.

For now, however, Monday's ruling adds a new level of chaos to a state already embroiled in ballot and election litigation. The fate of the North Carolina's map and timing of its midterms is still to be determined by continuing litigation in upcoming weeks. The case could scramble the House battleground map, in which Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to take control.

Such a late shake-up would lead to a new round of recruiting efforts, potential retirements and expensive races, just as this year's primaries conclude and both parties believed they were finally getting a full picture of the playing field.

Republican and Democratic campaign officials said their lawyers are still analyzing the ruling and considering their next steps.

"I'm shocked by the timing, given that it's less than three months until the election and given this is an unsettled area of the law," said Art Pope, a major North Carolina GOP donor and powerbroker.

If the court eventually orders new districts drawn before the November election, Pope would "imagine there would be massive lawsuits throughout the country ... you would end up having federal courts draw the districts for 2020. That's why I don't think SCOTUS will uphold" the opinion.

Asked about the possibility raised in the decision of a November primary with the new map, followed by a January special, Pope speculated the level of interest and spending could be historic.

"The amount of money if you have a special election in an entire state? It'd probably be the most expensive 13 congressional district elections in the history of the country," Pope said.

Because of ongoing litigation in an unrelated election case, the state had been holding off finalizing ballots for the November 6 midterms. Now the chance exists that the state might have to hasten to produce a new district map. In the Monday ruling, US Appeals Court Judge James Wynn raised several possibilities, including a new redistricting plan and delay in a general election date. He asked the parties to file briefs related to options by 5 p.m. Friday.

In the meantime, North Carolina state officials could ask the US Supreme Court to block the effect of Monday's decision so that the current redistricting plan can be validly used through 2018. With last month's retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, the high court currently has only eight members, ideologically divided with four conservative justices and four liberals. Five votes are needed to block a lower court ruling.

Senate hearings for President Donald Trump's nominee to succeed Kennedy, US Appeals Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, are scheduled to begin on September 4. If he wins Senate confirmation, he is likely to be sworn in as the ninth justice in late September or early October.

Legal controversy over gerrymandering

The lower court panel that ruled Monday had previously declared the map an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. (An earlier iteration of the congressional districts had been struck down as a racial gerrymander.) In June, the Supreme Court ordered the three-judge panel to reconsider its partisan gerrymander decision based on its ruling in a Wisconsin case that the challengers had lacked legal "standing" to sue because they had not demonstrated sufficient harm.

That ruling was unanimous, but four justices, led by Kagan, split off to offer a blueprint for challengers to show that voting power was diluted in individual districts or mount a statewide claim based on a First Amendment right of free association. In an unusual move, Chief Justice Roberts suggested her concurring opinion should be disregarded. He said the court's ruling was set forth in his opinion "and none other."

Roberts has made clear that he believes that judges should not take up such cases. He has said that if judges intervened to find that partisan gerrymander had gone too far to infringe on constitutional rights, siding with either Democrats or Republicans, people would view courts as simply favoring one party over another.

But Kagan stressed the "evils of gerrymandering," as did Monday's court, which it found violations based on the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and rights of free speech and association. The appeals court said that the Republican-controlled North Carolina assembly relied on data from past elections showing how particular precincts had voted to "to draw a districting plan that would ensure Republican candidates would prevail in the vast majority of the State's congressional districts and would do so in future elections."

"Put differently," Wynn wrote, invoking Kagan phrasing, "the General Assembly's Republican majority decided which ideas would prevail in the state's congressional elections. In doing so, they deprived Democratic voters of their natural political strength by making it difficult for such voters to raise money, attract strong candidates, and motivate fellow party members and independent voters to campaign and vote."

Rather than stay out of such cases, the lower court declared, judges might offer the only place to safeguard constitutional rights. "Indeed, the need for judicial review is at its most urgent in such cases," Wynn wrote, "for here, politicians' incentives conflict with voters' interests, leaving citizens without any political remedy for their constitutional harms."

Correction: This story has been updated to remove a quote that referred to an incorrect court. The ruling was made by a panel of three federal judges.
__label__politics (CNN) When Alabama voters go to the polls Tuesday to choose between Roy Moore and Doug Jones, they are, ostensibly, picking one out of 100 senators -- not to mention someone who will only serve until 2020 before having to run again.

But this Alabama special election matters a whole heck of a lot more than that. There are widespread implications that go well beyond the borders of Alabama and could influence not just the 2018 election but the broader images of the two political parties heading into 2020 and beyond.

The massively high stakes are why you see both President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama -- as well as a number of Democrats who would like to take on Trump in 2020 -- getting involved in the race as it reaches its conclusion. Anyone who is anyone -- or wants to be anyone -- is making sure their voice is heard in Alabama right about now.

Below, a list of the very real stakes in tomorrow's special election.

1. Trump's policy agenda

Republicans have a narrow two-seat Senate majority. Given the vocal anti-Trump wing (John McCain, Jeff Flake, Bob Corker) and the number of moderate skeptics (Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins) within the Republican Senate conference, it's already very, very difficult to get legislation passed. (See: Obamacare, repeal of.) If Jones managed to win -- and polling is all over the map on the race -- then Republicans would be down to a single-seat edge until next November.

For Trump priorities like building a wall along the Mexico border or entitlement reform, a one-seat advantage for Senate Republicans isn't enough. And if past is prologue, Democrats feel absolutely no pressure -- politically or otherwise -- to sign onto any Trump agenda item. Which means that even a single Republican opposing Trump forces Vice President Mike Pence to break a Senate tie. Two Republicans opposing a Trump priority and that priority is doomed.

2. The 2018 election

Every politician in Washington is watching to see what happens in Alabama. Every. Single. One. By any traditional political calculus, Moore should lose given the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct with teenagers while in his 30s leveled against him. (Moore denies all the charges.) But we are in extraordinary political times. Trump, after all, won while dismissing accusations of sexual misconduct from multiple women during the 2016 campaign.

At issue for Republicans is whether the Trump base -- which views what the President says as gospel truth and believes the media is lying, at all times, for partisan purposes -- turns out to vote for Moore and whether that turnout is enough to put him over the top. Democrats, by contrast, are trying to figure out whether they can come close to approximating the African-American turnout during the two presidential races of Obama.

If Moore manages to win, expect the rising voices of criticism within the GOP to grow quieter -- for fear of Trump. If Moore loses, the opposite will be true: The floodgates of Trump criticism from within his own party are likely to break open.

3.The GOP brand

The idea of Sen. Roy Moore terrifies most Republicans who have to be on the ballot next year. That sentiment was summed up nicely by the ever-quotable Sen. Lindsey Graham on CNN on Monday:

"Roy Moore will be the gift that keeps on giving for Democrats and define the 2018 election, at least 2018, and to think you can elect Roy Moore without getting the baggage of Roy Moore is pretty naive."

While the immediate concern -- as Graham rightly notes -- is the 2018 election, the prospect of Moore in the Senate potentially has much longer tentacles. Democrats can -- and will -- portray Republicans as the party of Trump (more than a dozen women accusing him of sexual misconduct) and Moore (a series of allegations about inappropriate behavior toward teenage girls) at every chance they get.

Yes, both men have denied the allegations -- fully. But those denials -- particularly given the number and credibility of the accusers -- won't satisfy lots and lots of voters.

Democrats, sensing opportunity, have worked to purge alleged sexual harassers from their ranks with the resignations of Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan in recent days. Such moves are clearly designed to regain the moral high ground when it comes to men behaving badly with women.

4. The #metoo movement

In the last week, the #metoo movement has come to Capitol Hill -- after becoming a driving cultural force in entertainment and media in the months since allegations about Harvey Weinstein's behavior went public.

Rumors are swirling -- in the wake of the planned resignations of Franken, Conyers and former Arizona Republican Rep. Trent Franks -- that more members of Congress may be swept up in all of this soon.

A Moore loss would suggest that the shift in the culture has come to politics -- even in a state as traditionally red as Alabama. A Moore win, on the other hand, might well serve as a sort of silencing mechanism for women in politics who are weighing whether or not to come forward with their own allegations of sexual misconduct. If Moore succeeds in spite of all of the women who have come forward, all telling very similar stories about how he approached them and what he wanted, there could well be a sense among women weighing whether to go public that it's simply not worth it given the potential fallout.

5. Donald John Trump

The President spent a few weeks playing coy about his support for Moore -- citing the fact that he was in Asia when all of this news broke. He is playing coy no longer. Not only has Trump endorsed the controversial former judge, but he held a de facto get out the vote rally for Moore on Friday night in Pensacola, Florida and has recorded robo-calls in the state for the Republican nominee.

For all of the White House's talk that they want to let Alabama voters decide on their senator, Trump has put a major thumb on the scale for Moore in the last 10 days. Which means Trump has skin in the game. Which means he has to own a loss by Moore -- if that happens. (You can be sure Trump will claim credit for pulling Moore over the line if the GOP nominee wins.)
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Administration officials within the Environmental Protection Agency are blocking a report from the public on the dangers of inhaling formaldehyde vapor, according to Politico.

The draft assessment, completed by EPA scientists shortly before the inauguration in 2017, shows that the inhalation of formaldehyde vapor puts people at risk of developing leukemia and other ailments, both a current and former agency official told Politico

The current and former agency officials told Politico the move is part of a campaign to undermine the EPA's independent research into the risks associated with toxic chemicals.

Though formaldehyde is found in everyday materials like wood and household products, it has been found to be highly toxic and may cause adverse health effects. The EPA considers formaldehyde a probable human carcinogen. However, this new draft assessment provides evidence of ties to nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia.

This report comes as EPA administrator Scott Pruitt resigned on Thursday amid months of ethics controversies. Andrew Wheeler , the EPA's deputy administrator and former coal lobbyist, will assume the position upon Pruitt's departure.

The EPA officials told Politico that Trump appointees have canceled key briefings that would have advanced the study and placed undue requirements on officials who would begin the required internal review of the formaldehyde study.

"They're stonewalling every step of the way," the current official said.

According to the Politico report, EPA staffers claimed that Trump administration officials including EPA chief of staff Ryan Jackson and Richard Yamada, an official in the EPA's Office of Research and Development, purposely worked to delay the process and revelations contained in the assessment.

But in a statement to CNN, an EPA spokesperson denied that the delays were intentional, and said they were instead caused by "needs for particular rulemakings" and "an extensive intra-agency and interagency process."

"Mr. Yamada and Mr. Jackson have not cancelled briefings on assessments or during the IRIS process, and in fact have requested briefings," said the spokesperson, before pointing out that there are groups skeptical of the EPA's previous work on the subject.

"The National Academy of Science and Congress in legislative reports have for years been highly critical of EPA's previous assessments involving formaldehyde."

Assessments from the Integrated Risk Information System, an independent science division of the EPA that produced the report, often form the basis for federal and state regulations. In 2016, the Toxic Substances Control Act created a " mandatory requirement for EPA to evaluate existing chemicals with clear and enforceable deadlines " and mandated "risk-based chemical assessment."

An EPA official who spoke to CNN describes the formaldehyde study as being at "stage 1 of a 7 stage process," and said the report is simply not ready for public consumption. According to the official, analysts are going over thousands of pages of documents in an effort to "get the science right."

The administration's handling of the formaldehyde study has come under scrutiny in the past, prompting an inquiry by Democratic senators in to its whereabouts. In January, Pruitt testified before a Senate panel that the study was nearly complete. In May, Sens. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse and Delaware's Tom Carper penned a letter to Pruitt asking about the delay, expressing concern that they had received no response from the administration in months. Markey claims in the letter than his office contacts the EPA every two-three weeks about the release of the study.

The EPA official could not explain to CNN why Pruitt told senators in January the report was "near completion" if it is still only in its first stage.

"Because formaldehyde can be found in such everyday items as furniture and personal care products, health risks are substantial." Markey said in a statement to CNN regarding the new revelations of the delay.

"Delaying the EPA's latest assessment of the health risks of formaldehyde only further endangers the public's health. The EPA should move past politics and focus on its job of protecting Americans' health."
__label__world (CNN) A rocket launcher and automatic rifles were among the 57,000 firearms handed in during a three-month gun amnesty in Australia, the country's first since tough gun laws were introduced in 1996.

Australia's Department of Home Affairs said Thursday 57,324 firearms and 2,432 parts and accessories were surrendered between July and September 2017.

The national amnesty was announced last year after police said illegal firearms had been used in several attempted terrorist attacks.

Surrendered items included this homemade machine gun in a suitcase.

Despite having some of the world's toughest gun laws, around 250,000 unlicensed guns are estimated to be in circulation in Australia.

Australia's gun legislation is often held up as an example for the US to potentially follow after a spate of shootings, most recently in Florida where a lone gunman killed 17 people at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school.
__label__politics (CNN) Faced with a 47-page indictment that details -- in excruciating specificity -- allegations that he and his wife repeatedly misused campaign funds for personal use, Republican California Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr. offered up this response: This is all just one big Democratic conspiracy.

OK, I'm over-simplifying but not by much.

"This is the Democrats' arm of law enforcement, that's what happening right now," Hunter said in an interview with a San Diego TV station . "It's happening with [President] Trump, it's happening with me. We're going to fight through it and win and the people get to vote in November ... I think they've used every dirty trick in the book, so it'll go to court when they want it to."

(Did I mention that Hunter gave this interview on his way to a fishing trip in advance of his court appearance on Thursday?)

Hunter sounded a very similar note in a formal statement in response to the indictment. "The fact is that there is a culture operating within our Justice Department that is politically motivated," he said. "We are seeing this with President Trump; we are seeing this with my case. This is evidenced by the fact that after two years of investigating, the Department of Justice decided to take this action right before my election."

Before we go any further, let's go over a few facts, shall we?

Fact #1: The Justice Department is run by Jeff Sessions, a former Alabama Republican senator. He was nominated to that job by President Donald Trump, a Republican. His nomination as attorney general was approved by the Senate, which is controlled by, wait for it ... Republicans.

Fact #2: The 200 examples of the Hunters allegedly dipping into funds for personal use. : The charging document in Hunter's case alleges that he and his wife overdrew their personal checking account more than 1,100 times in a seven-year period as they spent lavishly and well beyond their means. It listsexamples of the Hunters allegedly dipping into funds for personal use. 200

Those facts -- just the two! -- fundamentally undermine Hunter's pushback on the charges. And yet, there will be a bloc of people (and Hunter undoubtedly knows this) who will believe his denial solely because it is premised on the idea of a so-called "deep state" conspiracy against prominent conservatives. This may well be what legal (and political) fights look like in the age of Trump -- one side armed with facts, the other armed with conspiracy theories.

In lieu of a factual pushback against the charges against him, Hunter is simply throwing his arms around Trump and telling conservatives "See, I'm just like him! We're both victims of the deep state!" Aside from making the direct comparison between himself and Trump, Hunter's official statement makes several other clear attempts at mimicking Trump:

Hunter describes the investigation as a "witch hunt."

He makes mention of the fact that Hillary Clinton was never indicted for her role in establishing a private email server when she served as secretary of state

He throws out some red meat for conspiracy theorists -- noting that two prosecutors involved in his case went to a fundraiser at a private home during office hours.

In short; Hunter is laying the image of himself as a Junior Trump -- a victim of a corrupt Justice system -- on very, very thick. If Hunter were a comedian, he would not only tell the joke, but then come into the audience and explain it to you, and then borrow a cocktail napkin and diagram exactly why the joke works. Like, dude, enough already! We get it!

There's one big difference between Trump and Hunter, of course. Hunter has been indicted and faces a legal proceeding in which a jury and a judge will decide whether prosecutors are running some "deep state"-sting operation, or whether Hunter and his wife drastically abused the powers of his office. Trump has not -- and, according to Justice Department protocols, can't be. ( A sitting president can't be indicted according to the Justice Department; special counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly told Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani that he abides by that view.)

Trump, because of that status, is free to say what he likes about his own Justice Department and the alleged "deep state" conspiracy embedded within it who is out to ruin his presidency. Those claims can be made without a shred of proof. Hunter will face a much higher bar. It remains to be seen if he can come close to meeting it.

Regardless of how Hunter's case ends up, however, you can bet that he won't be the last Republican politician who, when backed into a corner, leans on the conspiracy theories that Trump has helped to build and fortify during his life in politics. The idea of a being a victim of an unforeseen -- but hugely complex and nefarious -- state apparatus is a powerful one. Like all good conspiracy theories, it can't be disproven. Any fact that runs counter to it is yet more evidence of how dug-in the "deep state" perpetrators actually are.

These are the lesser-known effects of Trumpism on the country. And now that the genie is out of the bottle, it won't easily go back in.

Of course, this ludicrous comparison leaves out that no one in modern US political history recalls Sen. McCarthy more than President Trump. But beyond that, it's not Trump or Mueller whose situation evokes a McCarthy comparison at the moment -- it's House Speaker Paul Ryan.

Why? Recall that in 1954, Sen. McCarthy faced and failed a famous " sense of decency " moment. In a nationally televised Senate hearing, McCarthy attacked Fred Fisher, a young lawyer in the law firm representing the US Army, McCarthy's latest target in his years-long demagogic and unsuccessful hunt for communists in the government. Fisher had been briefly associated in law school with the National Lawyers Guild, an organization thought to be associated with the Communist party.

Joseph Welch, the law firm's counsel attacked McCarthy's cruelty and recklessness. He then delivered the coup de grace, saying "Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?" Fisher went on to become the president of the Massachusetts Bar Association and McCarthy's reputation was destroyed and his career ultimately ended.

Which brings us to House Speaker Ryan.

In January, Speaker Ryan's 20-year career in Congress will come to an end.

Next month, Republican Representatives Mark Meadows from North Carolina and Jim Jordan from Ohio -- both leaders of the Freedom Caucus -- are expected to press Speaker Ryan to bring to the House floor their resolution to hold Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in contempt of Congress for his failure to turn over documents tied to the Russia investigation. Back in May, despite threats of impeachment, Rosenstein was adamant that the Justice Department was "not going to be extorted."

And here is where Speaker Ryan will get his "decency" test:

Does he stand up for Rosenstein, a highly regarded public official with a long, successful and respected career in law enforcement? Or does Ryan schedule a House floor vote on a meritless and politically motivated resolution to hold Rosenstein in contempt of Congress?

Rosenstein, who oversees the Russia investigation, has been under relentless attack for months by President Trump and his House loyalists . The goal of these attacks is clear -- to discredit, cripple and, if possible, kill the Russia investigation.

As part of this effort, Meadows and Jordan were among GOP leaders that recklessly filed articles of impeachment against Rosenstein just before the House left for its August recess. The alleged "grounds" for impeachment were Rosenstein's failure to comply with a Republican House Committee subpoena requesting the Russia probe documents.

The Justice Department has a longstanding policy of not releasing these kinds of investigative documents in the middle of a criminal investigation. Doing so could compromise the investigation if the information reaches the individuals under investigation -- a particular danger here, as President Trump and Rep. Meadows reportedly are key allies.

Nevertheless, in an effort to be as accommodating as possible, Rosenstein and the Justice Department have been providing the House with numerous documents from the Russia investigation.

To his credit, Speaker Ryan opposed the impeachment effort and noted that the House had made "tremendous progress" in getting the Justice Department to provide the documents it wanted. So far, so good.

Meadows and Jordan ultimately dropped their impeachment gambit and instead asserted that they would pursue a contempt of Congress resolution against Rosenstein in early September if all of the documents Republicans have subpoenaed are not received by the start of the month. According to a published report , Meadows claimed Ryan had agreed to this approach: "The speaker is willing to support [Judiciary] Chairman [Bob] Goodlatte in a contempt process if the agreed upon documents are not delivered."

The impeachment resolution was nothing more than an empty threat. In the 229-year history of the Constitution, Congress has never impeached a subcabinet official, such as a deputy attorney general. When Meadows and Jordan tried this reckless act in 2016 against IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, their baseless impeachment resolution offered was overwhelmingly defeated by a bipartisan vote of 342 to 72

However, if a contempt of Congress resolution against Rosenstein for failing to comply with Republicans' subpoena is brought to the floor, it might just pass on a party-line vote.

If that were to happen, the contempt resolution would serve the same purpose as articles of impeachment. It would give President Trump "cover" to remove Rosenstein from his job and to replace him with a Trump loyalist and take control of (and kill) the Russia investigation. This is what the Meadows and Jordan effort against Rosenstein is really about.

Ryan will face his "sense of decency" moment in September.

He can end his career in Congress on a high note, preserve his integrity and show his "sense of decency" by blocking the effort by Meadows and Jordan to slander and stain Rosenstein's reputation and record of public service.

Or, he can leave an indelible black mark on his reputation by enabling a contempt of Congress resolution against Rosenstein to be voted on and passed -- and demonstrate that, like Senator McCarthy, Ryan has "no sense of decency."

(CNN) In every generation we depend on a few people of supreme decency and intelligence to hold the world together. In Jewish tradition, there are at all times 36 tzadikim, righteous people, without whom the world would perish. Kofi Annan was one of the righteous people, a man of extraordinary intelligence, decency, warmth and joy of life. He helped to keep our world from blowing itself apart, or dividing mercilessly between the rich and the poor.

Kofi Annan brought the UN into the 21st century with a momentous two terms of office between 1997 and 2007. I was profoundly privileged to work for Kofi during that period, first as an adviser on an economic report, then as director of a commission at the World Health Organization, and then as his special adviser on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for six years, 2001-2007. It is perhaps superfluous to say that watching and learning from Kofi greatly enriched my life; he did that for all of us.

Kofi's core idea was that our crowded, interconnected world requires economic justice, peace and human rights. He would often say that there could be no development without security, no security without development, and neither security nor development without human rights.

He saw the need for the world to join together to deliver the end of poverty, the cessation of war and the protection of human dignity. He believed that the United Nations was the unique global institution that could support these immense ambitions, and he made it his life's work to fashion a UN for our times. He inspired countless others, myself included, to devote ourselves to the work of the United Nations.

Kofi opened up the doors of the UN to the people of the world. While the UN Charter appropriately begins with the words "We the Peoples," the members of the UN are in fact the world's governments. Kofi made sure that people all over the world would regard the UN as theirs, not merely their governments'.
__label__politics But how, exactly? And where the heck does all this go from here?

The truth is that between one-time Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's conviction on eight charges of financial crimes, former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen's plea deal, President Donald Trump's tweets and the ongoing probe into Russian interference being run by Robert Mueller, there are a ton of complex moving parts here.

Below I've attempted to unpack and answer some of the most pressing questions.

1. Which one is a bigger deal -- Manafort or Cohen?

They're both big deals, but the Cohen plea deal -- especially his testimony that he negotiated payments to women alleging affairs with Trump at the candidate's direction -- is the bigger deal . Of the eight charges Cohen plead guilty to as part of the plea deal, two of them were about breaking campaign finance laws. He testified that "in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office" he made payments to hush former porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged affair with Trump through a shell company named Essential Consultants LLC that he set up to disguise the transactions.

Those transactions are a violation of campaign finance law, which limits contributions to a candidate from any single person to $2,700 per campaign. Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 and urged the National Enquirer to make a similar payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for $150,000 in exchange for their silence. That Cohen was willing to testify that he did so at the direction of Trump suggests that the President of the United States in an unindicted co-conspirator in a felony. Which is a very big deal.

2. Why was Donald Trump's name not mentioned in the Cohen plea deal?

The plea documents don't mention Trump by name, they only refer to an Individual-1 who by January 2017 "had become the President of the United States." CNN's Kara Scannell notes that it's Southern District of New York practice (as well as the practice of the rest of the Justice Department) not to identify individuals or entities that they don't charge with crimes.

3. Will Trump be indicted?

Almost certainly not.

That's not necessarily because he hasn't done anything wrong but rather because of long-standing Justice Department protocols -- established during Watergate and affirmed during Bill Clinton's impeachment -- that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani cited this practice in an interview with CNN in May:

"The Justice Department memos going back to before Nixon say that you cannot indict a sitting president, you have to impeach him. Now there was a little time in which there was some dispute about that, but they acknowledged to us orally that they understand that they can't violate the Justice Department rules."

The Justice Department's stance on indicting a sitting president has never been challenged in court -- and there are some who believe that, if it was, there's a reasonable chance such a challenge could succeed. But Mueller, at least according to Giuliani, isn't likely to go down that legally perilous road. (For much more on the legal debate about indicting a sitting president, read this .)

4. Will Trump be impeached?

That is a much more interesting -- and relevant -- question. Impeachment is a political process whereas indictment is a legal one. Even before what happened on Tuesday, impeachment was always more likely than indictment for Trump.

The chances of Democrats pursuing articles of impeachment against Trump if they win back control of the House this November definitely increased on Tuesday but it's very hard to say how much. It's definitely below 50-50 at this point as even unapologetic Trump critics like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D) were unwilling to use the "i word" following the Cohen and Manafort news. "What Congress needs to do right now is we need to make sure that special (counsel) Mueller is fully protected from being fired by Donald Trump," Warren told CNN's John Berman on Tuesday morning when asked whether impeachment should now be on the table.

5. Is it smart politics for Democrats to run on impeachment this fall? Are party leaders and base activists in the same place on this?

The second question is a lot easier to answer than the first. And the answer is "no."

The base badly wants Trump impeached. They believe he has already committed high crimes and misdemeanors related to Russia's role in the 2016 election. Late last year 58 Democratic members of Congress supported an effort by Texas Rep. Al Green to bring articles of impeachment against Trump . But people like Warren and House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi of California have continued to stay away from making the 2018 election about impeaching the President. On Wednesday, Pelosi said that impeachment was "not a priority" for Democrats.

Should it be? That's the tougher question. Here's a window into Pelosi's thinking: Impeachment makes the Democratic base super passionate. That's good. But they are already beyond passionate about turning out to vote this fall to send Trump a message. So the only possible outcome of pushing impeachment is to potentially alienate voters in the middle who could be the difference between winning and losing the House. (David Axelrod, a CNN contributor and Barack Obama's longtime chief strategist, laid out the case against impeachment talk in a conversation I had with him earlier this year .)

6. What does any of this have to do with the Russia investigation?

On Tuesday afternoon, Matt Schlapp, the head of the American Conservative Union and a prominent Trump supporter, tweeted this : "So all this legal activity strange I see no 'Russian collusion' in any breaking news. Odd."

Which, on one level, is sort of accurate. The Manafort conviction deals with crimes committed well before he came into Trump's orbit in April 2016. It deals with financial malfeasance in Ukraine. And of the eight counts that Cohen pleaded guilty to on Tuesday, only two have any tie at all to the Trump campaign.

Here's where Schlapp's point breaks down: Both the Cohen and Manafort convictions come directly as a result of the Mueller investigation. And, in the document establishing the Mueller special counsel probe , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein makes crystal clear that Mueller is "authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters."

The other thing to keep in mind is that we simply don't know what Mueller knows -- and how Manafort and Cohen tie into what he knows. Both men were in Trump's inner circle for critical moments during the campaign. It may turn out that neither one had anything to do with Russia or the broader Russia probe. But to conclude they didn't when we still haven't seen a single word of Mueller's report is like leaving a basketball game in the second quarter and declaring that the team that was ahead when you departed "won."

7. Where is Michael Cohen right now?

Probably at home in New York. But definitely not in jail. CNN's Kara Scannell pointed me toward this note entered in court on Tuesday regarding Cohen's bond and whereabouts:

"Entered as to Michael Cohen: $500,000 Personal Recognizance Bond; Co-signed by wife and 1 additional financially responsible person; Travel restricted to Southern District of New York, Eastern District of New York. Southern District of Florida, Northern District of Illinois, and Washington D.C.; Passport to be surrendered to counsel - (No new applications); Surrender to law enforcement within 24 hours all firearms and ammunition."

Cohen is set to be sentenced in December and could face as much as 65 years in prison.

8. Where is Paul Manafort right now?

He's in an Alexandria, Virginia, jail awaiting sentencing, according to CNN's Evan Perez Manafort has been incarcerated since June when a judge revoked his bail and demanded that he spend his days in jail prior to his trial. (Manafort had been accused of repeatedly attempting to speak to witnesses in the case). No sentencing date has been set but Manafort faces up to 80 years in prison for the eight charges on which he was convicted.

9. Why didn't prosecutors make Michael Cohen agree to be a cooperating witness in the Mueller probe?

A good question, with no obvious right answer.

But here are a few things to consider:

The Cohen case is being prosecuted not by the special counsel but by the Southern District of New York. While it seems unlikely that if Mueller really wanted a cooperation deal he wouldn't make that clear to SDNY, it's worth noting they are separate entities.

Mueller already has any and all documents considered relevant to his investigation that were seized in the FBI's raid of Cohen's home, office and hotel back in April. Given that, all he would need Cohen for is to confirm that "yes, that is my email address" or "yes that is my handwriting" as opposed to deliver a bunch of secrets on Trump or the Trump inner circle. In short: Mueller might not need Cohen's cooperation.

Just because there is no stated cooperation deal in the plea agreement Cohen signed doesn't mean that he can't or won't cooperate with Mueller. Cohen lawyer Lanny Davis told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Tuesday night that "Michael Cohen is committed to telling the truth. ... If asked by any authority ... he will tell the truth."

10. Will Trump pardon Cohen or Manafort?

I can answer that question in two tweets from Trump on Wednesday morning.

On Cohen : "If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen!"

On Manafort : "I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. 'Justice' took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to 'break' - make up stories in order to get a 'deal.' Such respect for a brave man!"

Trump does have broad and unchecked pardoning power. And he's already shown he's willing to wade into controversial situations and use it -- as he did earlier this year when he pardoned ex-Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio . Lanny Davis said Wednesday morning that Cohen wasn't looking for a presidential pardon and wouldn't accept one if offered. (Narrator voice: Suuuuuuure.)

11. What does Mueller do next?

Keeps on keeping on. Mueller has revealed nothing about the progress of his investigation or any timeline by which he expects to wrap it up. There's no question that Manafort's conviction, which the special counsel's office prosecuted, and the Cohen plea deal, which they did not, provide momentum for Mueller.

But all that will matter in the end is what is in the Mueller report -- and what the two parties choose to do with it. Again, it's impossible to overstate how little insight we have into what Mueller knows, what he thinks he can find out and what he's given up on. The only big domino to keep an eye on that we will know when it falls is the long-debated sitdown between Trump and the special counsel's office. Giuliani has repeatedly indicated of late that negotiations are in the final stages and that a decision will come soon.

12. Does any of this matter?

In the most existential sense, no. In the long run, after all, we're all dead.

But on the less existential level, yes, it matters. What we are talking about here is a foreign government actively interfering in a presidential election for the purposes of helping one candidate and hurting another. What we are talking about is the former national security adviser admitting that he lied to the FBI and now cooperating as a witness. What we are talking about is the former campaign chairman for the President of the United States being found guilty on eight felony counts. What we are talking about here is the former fixer for the President of the United States pleading guilty to eight counts including two that directly implicate Trump in an attempted campaign finance coverup.

Now. Asserting that yes of course, this all matters, is different than saying it will change peoples' minds or votes. It might not! Minds have been made up about Trump for a very long time. For his supporters, they will find ways to dismiss all of this -- likely blaming the "deep state" they believe is dead set on keeping Trump from "winning." For Trump opponents, the events of Tuesday will simply confirm what they already believe: That Donald Trump is not fit to be president.

In the end, the Mueller report is still the one major piece of the puzzle that hasn't fallen into place.

(CNN) Major negotiations were set to take place on Wednesday in Washington on President Donald Trump's efforts to jawbone China and Mexico into trade pacts substantially more favorable to the United States.

But suddenly, a deeply wounded president may be ill-equipped to hold any feet to the fire in critical crises of his own making on three continents.

Initial media reaction across Europe and Asia overnight suggest a world somewhat stunned by the legal dramas Tuesday involving Trump's former lawyer and campaign chief. Stunned, and clearly aware of how problematic his presidency has suddenly become.

Then comes Wolffe's description of Trump that seems to resonate across Europe: a leader with "a delusional sense of power."

France's leading daily, Le Monde, carries a banner headline across its front page that proclaims "Donald Trump shaken by the judicial setbacks" of Manafort and Cohen.

In Germany, where there has been no love lost between Trump and Chancellor Angela Merkel, the leading daily Süddeutsche Zeitung headlined : "Ticking time bombs for Trump."

In Asia, the official Chinese news agency, Xinhua played the story very straight, quoting CNN as reporting "Cohen was not expected to cooperate with the government...saying that by pleading guilty both Cohen and prosecutors would avoid the spectacle and uncertainty of a trial."

Of course, the effects of this confluence of events should not be minimized. In Washington, American and Chinese officials were set to begin their first trade negotiations since June when talks between Wilbur Ross and China's lead economic adviser Liu He broke off in Beijing.

This time, there's a hard deadline, with new 25% tariffs set to kick in on $16 billion worth of goods on Thursday and Trump himself predicting there'd be no real progress in the latest round of negotiations. After all, why should there be?

Clearly the Chinese, deeply sensitive to political meteorology, can see which direction these winds are blowing. Already, markets across Asia and Europe have been shaken by Tuesday's judicial actions.

Moreover, a series of hearings before the US Trade Representative had to be extended from three to six days as 400 American companies and industry groups on Monday began parading their grievances and warnings of profound impact on their companies and the broader economy.

At the same time, Mexican and US officials were due to resume their trade talks in Washington on Wednesday after a day's postponement. The key outstanding issue? Automotive manufacturing, the quantity of locally made components needed to avoid tariffs.

And that's just the first step toward a renegotiation of the entire North American Free Trade Agreement -- a top priority for Trump, at least before the double blows that fell on Tuesday.

And Canada, quite prudently, is waiting on the sidelines to resume its talks with Washington to examine the outline of any Mexican-US agreement.

But trade is not the only issue that requires an American president in full command of the levers of power available to him. Also at stake are any number of pending or potential international crises, many provoked single-handedly by Trump before the apparently deep wounds inflicted in the last 24 hours.

A top Iranian cleric, Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, warned Wednesday that his country would target Israel if the US attacks Iran.

And there seems to be no doubt that Trump is hoping that his latest round of sanctions will have a significant impact, even without the now increasingly unlikely concurrence of his European allies.

Indeed, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will be meeting in Washington on Wednesday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as Trump's chief of staff John Kelly and son-in-law Jared Kushner -- a meeting the Independent of London points out comes "just as the president struggles to contain the fallout from a major fraud scandal." The newspaper adds that Hunt was visiting in an effort "to shore up creaking relations with the US."

Sadly, though, Trump doesn't seem to be slowing the speed of his ship of state that gives every evidence of careening ever more wildly out of control. It will be interesting to see if established world leaders -- those with whom Trump is in ever-deepening conflict -- step back and wait to see just how the President weathers the next several months.

Hopefully he will not seek to strike out blindly if he sees himself ever more deeply cornered or his survival in jeopardy.

The bottle-nosed dolphin, known as Honey, is being kept on her own in a small pool and is showing signs of mental stress, activists say.

The Inubosaki Marine Park, in the city of Choshi, just east of Tokyo, shut down in January because of a lack of visitors.

Park staff continue to feed the marine life at the aquarium.

But with no companions, Honey -- who was captured from the wild in 2005 -- is condemned to a lonely existence.

__label__world (CNN) The Chinese government could be moving to end birth restrictions, amid growing concerns over an aging population and a dropping birth rate.

Under current family planning rules, the majority of Chinese couples are limited to two children, following an easing of the country's notorious "one-child policy" in 2016. These restrictions now look set to be further relaxed under a new draft reform to the country's Civil Code, potentially allowing families to have multiple children for the first time in decades.

According to a brief statement released Tuesday by the National People's Congress, the new revised code "will no longer retain the relevant content of family planning."

The revised code won't be completed until March 2020 and there is no indication yet how exactly the change would be made, or whether any other restrictions or conditions might remain on Chinese families.

But a change to the country's strict family planning laws had been considered likely by experts for some time.

"The government will lift the policy, to what degree they then go further with pre-natal policy is another issue, but I think they'll lift the policy in the foreseeable future," Therese Hesketh, professor at the University College London's Institute for Global Health, told CNN.

JUST WATCHED The toils of China's one-child policy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The toils of China's one-child policy 00:56

Giving birth 'a national issue'

Worries over a falling birth rate had led Beijing to announce in October 2015 it would no longer mandate Chinese couples only had one child, ending policy that for decades has been blamed for infanticide and forced sterilizations.

Instead, parents were allowed and even encouraged to have up to two children. An opinion piece titled "Giving birth is a family matter and a national issue" was published on August 6 in the overseas edition of People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.

But the changes failed to produce a spike in the birth rate. In 2017, the country's total fertility rate was 1.6 children per woman, well below the 2.1 rate estimated to be necessary to keep the population steady.

"Relaxing the One Child policy actually didn't lead to an immediate jump in births, which the government was kind of predicting and counting on," Human Rights Watch senior researcher Maya Wang told CNN.

"So now the Chinese government has come around to the opinion as well they need to further relax their control and abolish the birth controls altogether."

CNN contacted China's National Health Commission, which oversees the country's family planning, for comment on the story.

Aging population

The Chinese government is concerned it could soon be running out of workers as the effects of the country's long-standing One Child policy begin to hit home.

The infamous policy was originally introduced in 1979 over concerns by the Communist Party leadership that the population would soon spiral out of control.

However several decades on, the family planning policy has left a shrinking pool of young people left to support their aging parents and grandparents.

"Especially in cities, the cost of having children is getting higher and higher. From birth to school, economic costs and time costs are rising," said the People's Daily opinion piece in August. "Many young people living in cities are not willing to have children."

Since the policy was implemented, the proportion of the population aged over 65 has risen from about 4% to almost 10%.

Given the worrying factors, experts had long considered a push to remove the limits on child births likely. Some even saw the issuing of a Year of the Pig stamp for 2019, featuring two adult pigs with three happy piglets, as a sign the Communist Party was preparing to move.

A similar stamp issued in 2016 for the Year of the Monkey featured two baby monkeys kissing their parent and was seen as a tribute to the dropping of the One Child policy.

"It is possible they may (introduce) gentle, pro-natal policies like we have in most countries around the world ... like proper paid maternity leave for longer and cheap or free kindergartens," Hesketh, the UK health professor, told CNN.

The One Child policy

If the change of policy is confirmed, it will mark the end of one of China's most controversial policies in its modern history.

Following its introduction the policy was an unqualified success, dropping the total fertility rate in China from about six births per female in the 1960s to less than two by the 2000s.

But critics say the methods by which it was accomplished were often brutal. Women living under the policy described forced abortions, heavy fines, and eviction from homes if they attempted to have a second baby.

The policy had worrying consequences for the gender balance as a desire for male children led to reported abortions and infanticide to ensure a couple's only child was a boy.

As a result, in 2016, there were 1.15 males for every female in China, one of the most skewed gender ratios in the world.

Wang of Human Rights Watch said while the Chinese government and its supporters viewed the policy as "painful but necessary," it had been an "affront to basic Chinese culture."

"I think every family in China has been touched by the family planning policy, every Chinese family can tell you about the mother, or aunt, or uncle, who had been forcibly aborted or given away," she said.

Wang said although the policy might have ended, there has been no accountability for the "abuses" that occurred during its implementation.

__label__world Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) A Myanmar court has sentenced two Reuters journalists to seven years in prison for breaking the Official Secrets Act while investigating a massacre of Rohingya Muslims.

Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were originally detained in December 2017 after working on an investigation into the mass killing of a number of Rohingya villagers in Myanmar's Rakhine state.

The violence was part of a conflict which the UN has described as a form of "ethnic cleansing," with military operations forcing more than 700,000 Rohingya, a minority Muslim group, to flee Myanmar to Bangladesh.

The two journalists were charged with breaching the colonial-era act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison, in July. The two men, both Myanmar nationals, pleaded not guilty.

The verdict was due last Monday, but the judge delayed it saying he was too ill to attend court that day.

Following the guilty verdict at the Yangon court Kyaw maintained the pair's innocence, but added that they were unsurprised by the verdict. "We didn't do anything wrong," he said. "We're not exactly shocked by the verdict."

The reporters were bustled from the court where a small crowd of supporters momentarily blocked policemen from pushing them into a vehicle to take them back to jail.

Than Zaw Maung, a lawyer for the reporters, said: "This is disappointing (and a blow) to democracy, rule of law and press freedom."

Both journalists testified in court that two police officers, who they had not previously met, had given them papers relating to their investigation during a meeting in a Yangon restaurant. Shortly after, they were arrested by plainclothes officers.

In April, a Myanmar police officer, Moe Yan Naing, testified that he had witnessed a plot by senior police to frame the two journalists by planting secret documents on them.

The case has been viewed as a litmus test of press freedom and democratic rights in the Southeast Asian country. Monday's verdict prompted immediate international censure and increased criticism of Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi , who has also faced a loss in support for her handling of the Rohingya issue.

A senior United Nations official condemned the ruling. "The United Nations has consistently called for the release of the Reuters journalists and urged the authorities to respect their right to pursue freedom of expression and information," said Knut Ostby, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Myanmar.

"Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo should be allowed to return to their families and continue their work as journalists," Ostby added.

Both men have been in custody for almost nine months. Kyaw Soe Oo has a three-year-old daughter, while Wa Lone has yet to see his newborn daughter who was born just three weeks ago.

Following the announcement of the verdict Kyaw Soe Oo's wife, Chit Su Win, burst into tears, according to a Reuters report.

Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen Adler said the conviction was "a sad day" for the organization, the two men and "the press everywhere," adding that the verdict "must be corrected by the Myanmar government as a matter of urgency."

Human Rights Watch Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson also condemned the decision.

"This conviction of the 2 Reuters reporters is a hammer blow against media freedom in #Myanmar, showing just how afraid the #Tatmadaw & #Myanmar government are of investigative journalism and critical commentary customarily found in a real democracy," he tweeted, referring to the country's military and civilian authorities.

The Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not responded to CNN's request for comment about the verdict.

Mass exodus

Last August, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims started fleeing across the Myanmar border into Bangladesh into what has since become the world's biggest refugee camp. Many of those who crossed the border have recounted horrific stories of being driven from their homes under threat of death.

Last month, an independent United Nations investigation into alleged human rights abuses carried out against the Rohingya called for the country's military leaders to be investigated and prosecuted for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

The damning report contains allegations of murder, imprisonment and sexual violence against the Rohingyas, carried out by the Myanmar military. The report alleges the military attacks were carried out under the guise of a crackdown on terrorists, and against a backdrop of impunity that effectively placed military leaders above the law.

Myanmar's military has repeatedly denied that it has deliberately attacked unarmed Rohingya. Instead, the authorities insist that it only targets Rohingya militants, mostly from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgent group that are alleged to have launched deadly attacks on police posts.

In the past, the United Nations has called the alleged campaign of violence, including mass killings, rape and the burning of Rohingya villages by Myanmar government forces a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing," while UN Special Rapporteur Yanghee Lee has said that the attacks bear the "hallmarks of genocide."

Fearless journalism

Reuters published a special investigation earlier this year that featured Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo's bylines.

It documented the killing of 10 Rohingya men reportedly carried out by Buddhist villagers and Myanmar troops. Reuters described the groundbreaking report as the first time that soldiers and paramilitary police had been implicated in testimony from security personnel.

The report used photographs, reporting and interviews conducted in Myanmar and Bangladesh to reconstruct the final moments of the dead men, who were fishermen, shopkeepers, teenage students and a religious teacher.

Following last month's UN report Facebook banned 20 organizations and individuals in Myanmar, including a senior military commander, from using its service and acknowledged that it was "too slow" to prevent the spread of "hate and misinformation" in the country.

Detained Myanmar journalist Kyaw Soe Oo carries his daughter as he is escorted by police to a courtroom for his trial in Yangon last month.

Wa and Kyaw's imprisonment has also led to increased pressure on Aung San Suu Kyi, with activists and commentators calling on her government to issue a pardon.

Suu Kyi was feted around the world for helping transition the country from military junta to semi-democracy, but now the legacy of the Nobel laureate is in doubt.

"I hope for the sake of these two reporters and their families that ASSK... issues the amnesty," tweeted Sean Connelly, director at the Southeast Asia at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank, referring to Suu Kyi by her initials.

"Her government has already done extraordinary damage to press freedom in Myanmar, in service of a cover up of crimes against humanity."

Reuters chief Adler said: "This is a major step backward in Myanmar's transition to democracy and it cannot be squared with the rule of law or freedom of speech."

He added that his organization "will evaluate how to proceed in the coming days, including whether to seek relief in an international forum."

The Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned the convictions. "Today's ruling against Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo on bogus charges marks a new press freedom low for Myanmar," said Shawn Crispin, CPJ's senior Southeast Asia representative.

"The process that resulted in their convictions was a travesty of justice and will cast Myanmar as an anti-democratic pariah as long as they are wrongfully held behind bars. We call on Myanmar's civilian authorities to immediately release the journalists."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Tuesday that the former intelligence chiefs and national security officials from whom President Donald Trump is considering revoking security clearances are being "oppressed."

In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on "At This Hour," Clapper suggested that he and others are being targeted by the Trump administration as a form of political retribution.

"The bigger issue to me is the jeopardy to First Amendment rights," he said. "That, to me, is the much bigger issue here where we're being suppressed or oppressed because of our outspoken political views or criticism of the current president."

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Monday that the President is weighing the possibility of stripping the security clearances of a half-dozen former officials, arguing that the individuals under scrutiny have "politicized and, in some cases, monetized their public service and security clearances."

The former officials under consideration include Clapper as well as former CIA Director John Brennan, former FBI Director James Comey, former national security adviser Susan Rice, former deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former National Security Agency Director Michael Hayden, according to Sanders.

__label__politics Story highlights White House press secretary Sarah Sanders offered a very short answer Friday

"We've been clear on that in the beginning, and the President's spoken on that," she said

Washington (CNN) The White House stood by President Donald Trump's previous comments when asked Friday whether the more than a dozen women who have accused him of sexual assault were liars.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders offered a very short answer when asked if the White House thought the women were liars.

"We've been clear on that in the beginning, and the President's spoken on that," she said.

The question came amid revelations in the media and entertainment industries and the realm of politics of stories of women coming forward to share encounters of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace.

On the campaign trail, then-candidate Trump dismissed the accusations from the more than a dozen women.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's executive order reversing course on family separations has not changed anything in terms of putting families that have already been separated back together, a government official confirmed Wednesday.

The agency later walked back the statement but said any further plans to reunite families were still in development.

The executive order does not speak to any families that have already been separated -- and existing policies place the onus on parents to find their children in Department of Health and Human Services custody and seek to reunite with them.

On Wednesday afternoon, an HHS spokesman said nothing had changed for the children in its care.

"For the minors currently in the unaccompanied alien children program, the sponsorship process will proceed as usual," HHS spokesman Kenneth Wolfe told CNN.

Later Wednesday, the agency put out a statement from Brian Marriott, a senior communications official at Administration for Children and Families, the same division of HHS. Though the statement said Wolfe "misspoke" about the executive order, Marriott did not say a clear plan for putting children back with the parents they had been separated from was in place.

"It is still very early and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter," Marriott said. "Our focus is on continuing to provide quality services and care to the minors in HHS/ORR funded facilities and reunifying minors with a relative or appropriate sponsor as we have done since HHS inherited the program. Reunification is always the ultimate goal of those entrusted with the care of UACs, and the administration is working towards that for those UACs currently in HHS custody."

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its own plans to implement the executive order.

The sponsorship process -- which finds friends, relatives or other suitable volunteers in the US for children in the custody of HHS -- is built mainly for children who come to the US illegally alone, as has traditionally been the focus of HHS.

But Trump's decision to criminally prosecute all adults caught crossing the border illegally -- even if they have children with them -- has resulted in thousands of children being separated from their parents and essentially defined as alone, then placed in HHS custody.

The existing sponsorship process does not include any procedures for proactively reuniting children with parents who brought them to the US and may be in government custody, though theoretically once released from custody a parent could apply to sponsor their child's release.

HHS Secretary Alex Azar said at a Washington Post event on Wednesday that his agency tries to keep track of parents.

"We keep in touch with the parents," Azar said. "Even under any circumstance we're working to always be in touch with the parents to ensure placement with relatives, and if parents are released, to ensure that they can go to the parents if the parents are appropriate sponsors, if there's no reason why a child would be in jeopardy. We'll keep working to place them with sponsors."

But that is not the process described by those on the ground -- nor articulated in any information about reunification distributed by the agencies to parents or reporters.

In a fact sheet updated on June 15, Customs and Border Protection says Immigration and Customs Enforcement is working to dedicate a facility that can be a "primary family reunification and removal center," where parents who are ready to be deported can "normally" be detained.

It also says, "ICE will work with detained parents to provide regular communication with their children through video teleconferencing, phone and tablets."

According to government figures, thousands of children have been separated from their parents already. From April 19 through the end of May, 1,995 children were separated due to the administration's zero tolerance policy, and 2,342 were separated from May 5 to June 9. The administration has not provided a total number for those overlapping time frames, nor information on how many children are still in government custody or have been returned to their parents.

Advocates working with immigrants say the system is anything but straightforward and functional.

The process to find one's child is "incredibly challenging and what I fear is that it might, in some cases, be impossible," said Wendy Young, president of the advocacy and legal support organization Kids in Need of Defense and an immigration policy expert.

"It's just very difficult to find somebody, especially after the parent's been deported," Young said, saying parents often return to remote, rural areas without stable phone lines. "The other thing to remember is that these people are going back to the same dangerous circumstances they fled ... and they are targeted once they're back."

Over the weekend, after visiting a temporary children's shelter in his district and asking the government for its reunification plans, Rep. Will Hurd said he wasn't satisfied that there was any plan for putting families back together

"That's nuts," the Texas Republican said.

A maze-like system

A series of barriers make it very difficult for parents who have been separated from their children under the administration's zero tolerance border policy to reunite with them, according to experts on the system and those who work with immigrants.

Parents are supposed to call hotlines to find their children, but they're difficult to navigate. Many of the families come from remote areas in Central America and are unfamiliar with US systems, and are likely to be distrustful of government. They're housed in facilities with limited access to phones and the ability to receive calls. The government does not provide any legal representation to immigrants in deportation cases automatically, so it is up to the detained immigrants to find lawyers who can help them.

Once the parent is in an adult detention facility, it is unlikely HHS can release their child back to them, as they would not qualify as a sponsor. The DHS has not made clear any policy to move those parents to family detention to be reunited with their kids, aside from its designated removal facility.

"When the family separation policy was implemented, there doesn't seem to have been any planning as to how parents were going to know where their children were, how children were going to know where their parents were, how they were going to be able to communicate and how they would be able to be reunited," said Mark Greenberg, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute who ran the HHS department that cares for undocumented children in the previous administration.

"So at this point there are probably several thousand children in the custody of (HHS) in shelters for unaccompanied children and large numbers of them probably don't know where their parent is and don't know how to communicate with their parent," he continued. "And when parents are in detention, there are clearly significant problems in being able to talk with their children. When parents are being deported, there doesn't seem to be any process in place for figuring what happens next for their children."

Once adults are referred for criminal charges and turned over to federal law enforcement, their children are deemed unaccompanied alien children and given to HHS.

Their cases are then split -- for the immigration courts who will decide if they stay in the US and in terms of which government agency is housing and keeping track of them.

Because adult cases tend to move much more quickly than those for children, parents may get deportation orders before their kids' cases are heard.

Even if they don't, advocates who work with the families say it can take months for families to be reunited. The American Civil Liberties Union is representing families in a court case challenging separations and says it's been eight months for one parent who has yet to have their kid returned, even though the parent is out of detention.

Experts who work with the families that have already been separated, like Young, say they are working with people in Central America that they believe have already been deported by this administration without their kids.

The policies do provide for a hotline parents can call, in theory, to locate their children. But advocates who have worked with immigrants trying to use the hotline have described a confusing and ineffective process.

Agencies have also distributed flyers to immigrants with information about the process in English and Spanish. The flyer gives them the numbers and says the government will work across agencies to schedule regular phone communication, but advocates say it doesn't seem to be working.

Forms for parents to fill out for HHS obtained by CNN explain to the parents in Spanish that their children are considered unaccompanied minors and that they can offer up information about potential sponsors for their children. But if they don't provide that information, the document says, the government cannot guarantee the child will be placed with someone of the parents' choice.

In ICE custody or in jail, parents can't receive phone calls. Meanwhile, most HHS facilities require people trying to speak with a child to leave their information for a call back, so that HHS can make sure the person is someone authorized to speak to the child, advocates say.

"The bottom line is they didn't think through family reunification when they launched this policy because it wasn't of interest to them. It wasn't a concern," Young said.

"It's deeply concerning that it's not clear if there are any plans for how to provide for reunification of the separated families and children," Greenberg echoed. "As a threshold matter, it will be very difficult to do reunification if parents and children don't know where each other are."
__label__politics (CNN) Darla Shine, the wife of new White House deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine, hosted a radio show in the late 2000s where she once mocked victims of sexual harassment in the military and repeatedly pushed fringe conspiracy theories about vaccines.

CNN's KFile reviewed hours of audio from Darla Shine's radio program after her controversial views came to light. Shine, who long maintained a blog called "Happy Housewives Club" where she featured recipes and tips for cleaning and budgeting and promoted her radio show and book, has faced scrutiny in recent days after Mediaite and Huffington Post reported she had made racially charged comments and spread baseless anti-vaccination conspiracy theories on her now-deleted Twitter account.

Shine pushed her controversial views to a much wider audience and in much more depth on the "Darla Shine Show," a radio broadcast she hosted on the Talk Radio Network in 2008 and 2009 that boasted syndication on 100 radio stations nationwide.

Speaking in August 2009, Shine declared herself a "sexist" and said women serving with men in the military should expect to be sexually harassed.

"And why on earth would you fight to go on the submarine ship for months on end? You know there was just a story with these girls, these women who are upset that they are sexually harassed in the military," Shine said. "What do you think is going to happen when you go on a submarine for 12 months with 4,000 horny soldiers?

"I hate to say it, but it's true. They should not even be allowed. The top military should say, 'No way, you're not allowed.' But you know, the feminists have fought for these rights. It's so stupid. I don't know why anybody would want that."

Bill Shine exited his job as president of Fox News in 2017 amid allegations he had mishandled reports of sexual harassment at the network. He joined the White House earlier this month.

Darla Shine routinely had on as guests prominent members of the anti-vaccination movement and pushed conspiracy theories about vaccines herself. Shine also weighed in on cultural and political issues.

She did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The White House did not respond to CNN KFile's request about whether Bill Shine endorses his wife's views.

Darla Shine devoted much of the time on her radio show to spreading unfounded and debunked conspiracy theories about vaccinations.

In various episodes, Shine suggested a flu pandemic could be a "setup" by the government in collusion with pharmaceutical companies, pushed a rumor that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was planning on rounding up those afflicted with swine flu and putting them in camps, and said the government could break into homes and force citizens to get the flu vaccine.

Shine said armed resistance might be needed to fight against this. She also called for the closing all US borders because of the swine flu.

Shine declared sunscreen "a hoax" and said she refused to put it on her children.

The American Academy of Dermatology has said there is no evidence that sunscreen is hazardous, while the Food and Drug Administration has declared that there is no link between vaccines and autism.

Shine also passed on a false "rumor" that Barack Obama could not get a security clearance when running for president.

She claimed to believe in UFOs and interviewed self-identified alien abductees

At the top of her radio program, a man's voice reads out a disclaimer, saying, "Warning: This is the 'Darla Shine Show.' Everything you hear is Darla's opinion. Some facts are true; others are made up. So take what you want, use what you can and you get what you get so don't get upset."

Here's the full context of what Shine said

On women in the military:

"And you know what, I'm the first person to admit I'm sexist. I don't think that girls should play on the boys' high school team. I don't think that the girls should be -- I think it's insanity that there are feminists who are stupid enough to fight to go to combat. Are you kidding me? Let the men go die on the front lines," Shine said in an August 2009 episode . "Why would you want to go die on the front line? You have to be an idiot. And why on earth would you fight to go on the submarine ship for months on end? You know there was just a story with these girls, these women who are upset that they are sexually harassed in the military. What do you think is going to happen when you go on a submarine for 12 months with 4,000 horny soldiers? I hate to say it, but it's true. They should not even be allowed. The top military should say, 'No way, you're not allowed.' But you know, but you know the feminists have fought for these rights. It's so stupid. I don't know why anybody would want that."

Spread the conspiracy theory that Obama couldn't get a security clearance:

"And I'm sure you heard the rumor that Barack Obama couldn't get a security clearance required to work for the FBI or CIA," Shine said in a November 2008 show. "And I want to know if this is true. I mean I'm just a little housewife at home, living my life, taking care of my children. But I'm concerned if we're going to have a president that could not pass a security clearance. Especially, aren't we in a war against terrorism? Aren't we, like, fighting terrorists? So why wouldn't we have a security check for a man who's going to run the country? And I mean not just Barack Obama, but what about our senators, our congresspeople? Do they go through the same security background check as a CIA person would have to go through? I never thought about this."

On sunscreen:

"I really do not believe in this whole sunscreen hoax. It just seems ridiculous to me to take your little infant -- the number one organ in your body is your skin," Shine said in a May 2008 episode , "But yet we take these chemicals and slather it all over our little babies' bodies to be soaked in day after day, sweating into their body. I just can't think that this is good. So let's just use common sense. Guess what? Keep your baby out of the sun. It's pretty easy to do. I don't think it's that difficult if you have a little newborn baby."

On closing the borders:

On a May 2009 episode , in response to the ongoing swine flu pandemic, Shine said, "People can say that I'm a racist and I'm a terrorist or I'm extreme because I want to shut the borders, but right now I'm thinking if we are going to go to a level six, we do need to shut down our borders. We don't let anyone in and we shouldn't let anyone out. We should protect our country."

On rumors of FEMA camps:

"Rumors flying around that FEMA is ready to round you up and take you off to a concentration camp," Shine said in May 2009 . "Forget about socialism. I think we're headed towards full blown communism and forget about your freedom of speech. Radio hosts are being kicked off the air for suggesting that we close our borders and stay away from illegal immigrants. Are you kidding me? What is going on? I am willing to get kicked off the air. Here I am. Come and get me. I am going down with a fight. Why on earth are we not allowed to have this conversation? There's a country that has a full blown epidemic and it's called Mexico. Why on earth is it racist for us to say we need to close our borders to them at this time?"

On vaccines:

Claimed the 2009 flu pandemic could be a "setup":

"So back when Bush was still in office, they bring over this, this pharmaceutical company," Shine said in a May 2009 interview with anti-vaccination activist Rita Palma. "It's not a pharmaceutical, it's a vaccination company, Novaris (sic), but they make drugs also. So they are here in the United States and their goal, their number one reason for existing here is to make a flu vaccination. And then all of a sudden we have this big pandemic. It almost sounds like it's a setup."

Claimed the government wants people to be "diabetic and cancer-ridden" so they can't think for themselves:

"They don't want people to be healthy," Shine said in the same 2009 interview with Palma, speculating as to why the government does not remove toxic food products from the shelves. "If people were really healthy -- everyone is fat and overweight -- and the next half-hour we're going to talk about how we can cut back on our favorite summer foods and cut calories with Cooking Light executive chef -- but if they keep everyone fat and overweight and diabetic and cancer-ridden and stupid and sick, no one has any willpower to fight back or even think for themselves. That's what the goal is."

Said vaccines make children sicker to get people to buy more medication:

"Why do they even want to do this? Do you think they care if you get sick or I get sick?" Shine asked of the government in a May 2008 episode . "I think they do care because they want you to get sick so you could buy more meds, more pharmaceuticals, more drugs. Why aren't they pushing instead, instead of putting out this idea to have another vaccination, why not put out a proposal to -- guess what -- live healthier? Oh, we have soda machines and ice cream machines in the schools. We have irradiated meat and toxic cows that we're using to the -- give to the kids for lunch. OK, but let's give them the flu vaccine too. Let's get them sick. Let's make them obese, but let's give them the flu vaccine. Now we've got to vaccinate our kids for the chicken pox. What's wrong with having the chicken pox? It's ridiculous. Why not instead teach Americans how to boost their children's immunity? Well, I'll tell you this. If your child continues to get these vaccinations over and over, I think it compromises their immunity. This is my opinion. I'm not a doctor, but I do all the research. And, listen, some vaccinations I think we need, but do our children need to have all of these other ridiculous ones like meningitis and chicken pox and now the flu? It's insanity."

Claimed that small children's bodies can't handle vaccines:

"When we were children we had what, three vaccinations and they were spread out and we got them older. Now they have these newborn babies that are getting this five-in-one vaccination. Their little bodies cannot handle this," Shine also said in May 2008 while interviewing anti-vaccination activist John Gilmore. "And what I want to know from you, and I'm going to keep you on after we go to the commercial, but what I know from you is what is the government up to -- like, really, if I get the flu or my kids get the flu, they could care less. I'm sure they'd be happy if I dropped dead so I can stop trashing them each week on the radio. So what on earth are they up to? Are we really gonna do this to our society just so people can make money?"

On forced vaccinations and armed resistance:

In August 2009 , Shine said the government was going to put people in camps to force untested vaccines on them.

"There are some people dying, but does this mean that we rush a vaccine to market without even testing this vaccination? First of all, this flu is mutating like crazy. It's changing every single day, so whatever they're putting together is not going to protect you from the swine flu in the fall. Number two, billions of dollars of government tax money, your money and my money, is paying these drug companies to rush this to the market. This way fat cats can make more money in their pocket. This is publicly traded, and they're going to test it on your children. You have to start reading this. I started reading about this. They're putting together underneath the Homeland Security Act. They can round you up. They could break into your house, hold you down, give you this freaking vaccination. They could give it to your kid at school. I can't even believe it. They're putting together quarantine camps. Is this happening in America?"

"I have a woman coming on who's an expert on this. When you hear what she has to say, you better just get your gun locked and loaded and start putting big locks on your doors," Shine added.

Called mandated vaccines unconstitutional:

"We're not going to be forced to vaccinate our children," Shine said in August 2009 . "We're not going to be forced to give our children what we don't want to give them. It's unconstitutional. We have the power over our families and if we allow that loss, if we lose that power, I ask you this, what is next, folks? I want you to think about that all week. What will be next if we allow this happen?"

Said vaccines are linked to autism:
__label__world Leixlip, Ireland (CNN) Fiona and her husband aren't religious. They don't go to Mass, take communion or recite the Holy Rosary.

But twice in recent years, the couple have driven halfway across Ireland to baptize their children at their families' community parishes.

The reason? Their children's education.

The sacrament -- and the certificate that comes with it -- has long held the key for parents hoping to secure a place for a child's first day at school in Ireland, where approximately 90% of primary schools have a Catholic ethos.

Although those schools are state-funded, their Catholic Church patrons set the admission guidelines, giving Catholic children priority enrollment over non-Catholics in a crowded system.

This school year, that's all set to change.

In July, the Irish parliament passed a bill outlawing the "baptism barrier," making it illegal to prioritize baptized children in the admissions process at Catholic schools. The bill exempts minority faith schools, who account for only about 5% of all primary schools.

The move was announced just a month before Pope Francis' scheduled visit to Ireland, the first papal visit in nearly four decades.

It's the latest in a series of policy changes that reflect the gradual erosion of the ties between church and state -- changes that people like Fiona say reflect a modern, secular society fed up with the Church's hold on its public institutions.

"We need to get our futures and our kids' futures and our own bodies out of the hands of religion," Fiona says.

A sign at the Church of Our Lady's Nativity in Leixlip that was put up ahead of Pope Francis' visit this weekend.

As the bill was being debated in May, Education Minister Richard Bruton said it was "unfair that a local child of no religion is passed over in favor of a child of religion, living some distance away, for access to their local school," adding that "parents should not feel pressured to baptize their child."

Efforts to reach representatives and advocates for Catholic schools to comment for this report went unanswered.

But one school official gave an interview to public broadcaster RTE in May.

Seamus Mulconry, general secretary of the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, said dropping the baptism barrier was "redundant," emphasizing that the issue of admissions was not about religious discrimination but about there not being enough schools in a few high-growth areas.

"The issue is the lack of school places, not religion," Mulconry told RTE. He emphasized that Catholic schools would welcome any student who wanted to join, as long as there was a place for them.

"Catholic schools want to accept everybody who applies," he said, adding that the baptism barrier had only affected a small number of people and that he had never met someone who had gotten a baptism purely for school purposes.

But Fiona -- whose name has been changed out of fears her children could face "repercussions" at school -- says she's one of them.

'You can't unbaptize your child'

In 2012, Fiona was living with her young family in an area of central Dublin known for overcrowded schools. Fearful that her children might be put on a waiting list or face a long commute, she decided to get them baptized.

At her older daughter's pre-baptism consultation, the priest asked her why she had decided to do so, noting that she and her husband weren't regular churchgoers.

"He prodded if we were doing it for school reasons," Fiona recalled. "I pretty much lied through my teeth."

The 40-year-old agnostic mother of two says she "went through the motions of the service quietly" as her husband, a staunch atheist, remained silent. The couple had told each other, "We have to do this if we want the kids to have the best."

Fiona's family has since moved to Leixlip, a commuter town west of Dublin, where overcrowding is less of a problem, but finding a secular school is.

A woman passes one of three Catholic primary schools on Leixlip's Green Lane.

Their 6-year-old daughter is in her first year at her Catholic-run local school, where she takes part in daily religious lessons.

On average, Irish schools spend 10% of compulsory instruction time on "religion, ethics and moral education" -- the second highest among developed nations, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Although children can legally opt out of the daily 30-minute religious instruction, several parents told CNN that doing so can lead to isolation and segregation from their peers.

Many schools don't have adequate resources to look after children who aren't in religious instruction, often leaving that time for remedial tasks such as filling in coloring books at the back of class.

"There are people in her class who don't participate in religion but they just sit in the corner in the room," Fiona explained. "It's like, 'Look at you guys in the corner.'"

Another parent who shares Fiona's concerns is Paddy Monahan, a Dublin lawyer who spearheaded the campaign to eliminate the baptism barrier in 2015 and is now campaigning with the organization Education Equality to change the system altogether.

Catholic schools often "shun that child every day to the back of the class, sitting separately, absorbing every point of their (religious) lesson and making them feel different every day of their lives," Monahan told CNN.

For parents who have baptized their children, whether for religious reasons or for "convenience," explaining why they might want to take their children out of religious instruction can be uncomfortable, so many just go along with it, and choose to focus on the positives.

Globally the Irish education system ranks well, with 2016 literacy rates among 10-year-olds the best in Europe and among the best in the world, according to Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (Pirls) results.

Scoil Chearbhaill Uí Dhálaigh, an Irish-language Catholic school in Leixlip.

Despite that, Fiona wishes the end of the baptism barrier had come sooner.

"You can't unbaptize your child," she said.

Still, she welcomes the move as progress, one that reflects Ireland's changing social landscape

While Roman Catholicism remains the dominant religion in Ireland, the number of people identifying as such has fallen over a five-year period, from 84.2% in 2011 to 78.3% in 2016.

Some 470,000 people -- nearly 10% of the country's population -- now identify as having no religion at all, a rise of 74% in the same period.

In 2017, only a little over half of all marriages (50.9%) were held in a Catholic Church, a 31% decrease over 10 years. Church attendance has been in decline for years, in part because of a series of scandals including systemic child sexual abuse.

Ahead of Pope Francis' visit to Ireland this weekend, the pontiff released an unprecedented letter acknowledging the Church's failure to act over sexual abuse by clerics against minors going back decades.

While the Church is facing renewed anger in Ireland over abuse allegations, it has also found itself on the losing side of two recent referendums that legalized same-sex marriage and abortion, respectively -- changes that were unimaginable just a few years ago.

And although the elimination of the baptism barrier might not be as monumental, some hope the measure could help to pave the way for an overhaul of Ireland's education system.

'Why are they still running our schools?'

In 2015, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights criticized the Irish educational system, citing a lack of access to secular, state-funded education.

That same year, Dublin resident Nikki Murphy says, her son Reuben was rejected at 13 different schools because he hadn't been baptized. Murphy was opposed to "pragmatically" baptizing her son, so she launched a campaign to open a local school that wouldn't "discriminate against any child on the basis on religion or on their social economic background."

Road signs mark a school zone in Leixlip.

She eventually took her case to Ireland's high court, filing a discrimination lawsuit against the state, the department of education and the attorney general.

Within 10 days of lodging her case, Murphy says she was offered a building where they could open a secular school.

In 2017, the education minister announced plans to open more multi-denominational and non-denominational schools. The plans include transferring patronage out of many of the schools -- the majority of which are owned by the Catholic Church -- to secular school patrons like the educational charity Educate Together. The plan aims to open 400 such facilities by 2030.

But parents whose children are set to start school soon say it's not happening fast enough.

Orla Matthews lives in Leixlip with her 4-year-old son, Faolán. She was raised Catholic but now identifies as atheist and never considered baptizing her son.

Matthews and her son Faolán outside the North Kildare Educate Together school, a 15-minute drive from their house. Matthews placed her son on its waitlist in March 2015, hoping for a spot by September 2019. Now she is campaigning for another secular school to open in her locality.

There are only four elementary schools in his closest school district, and they're all Catholic.

"Haunted" by the Church's involvement in a variety of scandals, Matthews, 40, says it is hard to imagine sending him to schools with a Catholic ethos.

When she was seven months pregnant, a mass grave of babies born out of wedlock was discovered in County Galway in the west of the country. Almost 800 children, who once lived at a home for unwed mothers and babies run by the Catholic sisters of Bon Secours, were discovered. Death certificates were found, but no burial records located from children who had died between 1925-1961. Some were found buried in an area near a sewage tank. Dublin's Archbishop called it "sickening."

The news shook Matthews, a single mother, to her core.

"That was like the final nail in the coffin," she says. "I wanted nothing to do with the Church. The Church's treatment of single mothers and their children was just abhorrent to me."

Now, Matthews is directing her energy towards campaigning for a more secular educational system, hopeful that an Educate Together school might open nearby next year.

Matthews stands outside of a Catholic primary school closer to her home.

"Why are we paying taxes -- and the Church, who have treated single mothers so badly in the past, why are they still running our schools?" Matthews asks.

Faolán was placed on a waiting list for a secular school the day she came off maternity leave. But three and a half years later, she's still waiting.

'Inclusive and all embracing'

That's because there are not enough of those schools to feed the growing demand, according to Paul Rowe, chief executive of Educate Together, an independent group that runs secular schools. And it's not just non-believers who want to enroll.

Some devout parents choose Educate Together schools because they want their children to be able to mix with children from different backgrounds.

Other religious families prefer to take responsibility for their own children's religious education at home, one sign that the Church can no longer set societal norms unquestioned.

"There's a huge generational change that's trying to redefine that in terms of the democratic sector, inclusive and all-embracing," Rowe told CNN.

Ditching the baptism barrier is a step in the right direction, he says, adding that it's shed light on just how untenable the Church's monopoly on power is.

When the school charity formed in 1978, it was met with "great popular support" but "huge establishment resistance, primarily from the religious organizations," Rowe said.

Religious organizations claimed that Educate Together was pioneering "godless schools" and was an anti-clerical organization, "hostile to the concept of Irish nationhood," he said.

Matthews's son Faolán, 4, will enter the school system next year.

But Lowe says the Church's position on secular schools has evolved.

"At a high level, they see that monopoly control (over the education system) is untenable and they finally consider us to be constructive partners."

While the Church is still in a position of great power in terms of school patronage, the end of the baptism barrier may signal a broader secularization of the country in the years ahead.

"It's almost as if Ireland is becoming an oasis of civic sanity in a Europe and a world where there is increasing polarizing and nationalistic and sectarian trends going on. What's very interesting about the social situation today is that Ireland seems to be going very strongly in the other direction," Rowe said.

For parents like Matthews, that's the sort of Ireland she envisions for her son.

"I choose to be atheist, but I don't expect my child to be that," Matthews says, adding that she believes religion should be a choice made outside the school system.

"If he chooses to be Catholic later in life, I would support him. But that has to be his decision."
__label__world The ‘Godfather of Coral’ predicts a ‘planetary catastrophe’ Rebecca Wright and Ivan Watson, CNN Video by Tom Booth and Stuart Ireland for CNN

Townsville, Australia — In a dusty, secluded corner of the Australian state of Queensland, a septuagenarian scientist is on an urgent mission to raise the alarm about the future of the planet.

John "Charlie" Veron -- widely known as "The Godfather of Coral" -- is a renowned reef expert who has personally discovered nearly a quarter of the world's coral species and has spent the past 45 years diving Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

But after a lifetime trying to make sense of the vast ecosystems that lie beneath the ocean's surface, the 73-year-old is now becoming a prophet of their extinction.

More on the Great Barrier Reef

"It's the beginning of a planetary catastrophe," he tells CNN. "I was too slow to become vocal about it."

In 2016 and 2017, marine heat waves caused by climate change resulted in mass bleaching, which killed about half of the corals on the Great Barrier Reef, along with many others around the world.

"Somewhere between a quarter and a third of all marine species everywhere has some part of their life cycle in coral reefs," he says. "So, you take out coral reefs and a third to a quarter of all species gets wiped out. Now that is ecological chaos, it is ecological collapse."

Watch the full documentary: Race to save the reef

One of the natural wonders of the world, the Great Barrier Reef is 2,300km long -- roughly the length of Italy -- and is the only living organism that can be seen from space.

When Veron, a former Chief Scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, first went diving on the vast reef in the early 1960s he felt like "his life started."

"It was so much packed into a small area, so much life, so much activity, even noisy. It was really a metropolis, it was really humming and buzzing," he says. "It's a wilderness, it's dangerous, it's exciting."

At that stage, he had no idea about what was in store for this vibrant underwater habitat.

"I was a climate change skeptic, at first," he says. He realized that climate change was "serious" in the mid-1980s, and around 1990 he became "alarmed" about its impact on coral reefs.

The Great Barrier Reef is home to more than 1,500 fish species.

Coral reefs 'on death row'

Veron says the mass bleaching events in the past few years -- and the prospect of losing one of nature's greatest treasures -- were a wake-up call for the world in the wider battle against climate change.

"It's more than an alarm bell," says Veron. "It's an air raid siren."

But the die-off came as no surprise to him. Back in the 1990s, he had predicted that climate change would destroy the reef, documented in several books he published, and in a 2009 keynote lecture titled "Is the Great Barrier Reef on Death Row?" at the Royal Society in London, where he was introduced by veteran British naturalist Sir David Attenborough.

Attenborough described Veron as "one of the great authorities in the world on coral" who has "devoted himself to looking after and raising awareness about the dangers facing the reef."

Among the Australian conservation community, Veron's reputation is also unmatched.

"Charlie is a legendary figure in coral reef circles. There's no-one else in the world who has seen what Charlie has seen," says Richard Leck, the Head of Oceans at WWF Australia. "He comes with a level of experience and gravitas that few other people and organizations could match and that's where his enormous influence comes from."

After the recent mass bleaching events, Veron dived in multiple areas of the Great Barrier Reef to see the damage for himself.

"I was seeing it and feeling it and it was absolutely horrific, there's no other way to describe it," he says.

Veron took CNN underwater for a first-hand look. There are still large sections of healthy, thriving parts of reef that are teeming with life. But there are also vast areas of coral graveyards that look like they suffered an underwater forest fire.

In the summer of 2018, experts say no bleaching occurred, which has helped some of the bleached coral to begin the recovery process. But Veron says it takes about 10 years for corals to recover fully, and they simply don't have that sort of time.

"For most years, say five out of seven years, there will be now mass bleaching on coral reefs around the world," he says.

Veron says he hates to predict the future for the Great Barrier Reef, because it "can't be anything other than absolute massive death."

His certainty is partly due to the fact that the oceans are only now seeing the impact of carbon emissions from the late 1990s, so Veron says even if we stop burning fossil fuels now, the oceans will continue warming for at least two more decades.

A life underwater

Born John Veron, his teachers at school gave him the nickname "Charlie" after Charles Darwin, due to his obsessive curiosity with the natural world, as detailed in his 2017 memoir, "A Life Underwater."

He has had a storied career in academia and research, becoming the first scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and later its Chief Scientist. But he eventually left as, he says, he struggled with the bureaucracy of working for the government agency.

"Charlie is a maverick, he is certainly outspoken and is certainly passionate," Leck says. "Charlie has risked his reputation, probably his livelihood, and people who don't want the status quo to change get upset about that."

Now, Veron spends his days mostly working from his rural home “Rivendell' -- named after the refuge of the elves in the J. R. R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" -- near Townsville in Queensland.

The sprawling concrete structure, which Veron helped to build more than 40 years ago, is immersed in nature. Wandering outside the house he points out multiple wallabies. His pets include dozens of fish, two dogs and a few geese.

He lives with his second wife, 60-year-old British coral biologist Mary Stafford-Smith, who has co-authored and edited many of his books. Together, they are documenting and categorizing the world’s corals on their website, Corals of the World.

Veron has three adult children: one daughter from his first marriage, and a son and daughter with Stafford-Smith. His face clouds over as he talks about the heartbreak of losing another daughter, Noni -- short for Fiona -- who drowned in a creek as a 10-year-old.

He again turns gloomy when he talks about the family's plan to leave their beloved Rivendell, to move further north to an area which is higher and wetter, where they could one day live off the land. He says he wants to secure his family's future for a world that he believes will be ruined by climate change.

"We have to have a refuge for our children when everything goes belly up," he says. "We've got no choice."

'Mass extinction event'

This doomsday scenario seems extreme, but after decades of studying scientific evidence around this topic, Veron believes that this eventuality is a certainty.

"We have got now also the phenomenon of a mass extinction event looming," he says, which he describes as a "man-made asteroid" that would compare to the dinosaurs being wiped out.

The biggest driver of increased carbon emissions in the atmosphere is burning coal, he says, and that's something he thinks Australia is not doing enough to stop.

"It's very political, because no country is as addicted to coal as Australia is," he says. "We're making a fortune out of coal."

Australia was the world's largest exporter of coal in 2017 and although the country is signed up to the Paris Agreement on climate change, this week the Australian government withdrew its National Energy Guarantee (NEG) legislation -- which included targets for lowering carbon emissions -- saying there was a lack of support for the bill.

Race to save the reef

Earlier this year, the Australian government announced nearly $400m in new funding towards scientific projects designed to help the Great Barrier Reef.

Corals are colonies of small animals called coral polyps.

There has been criticism in Australia about the tender process for the funding, as the money was given directly to a small charity -- the Great Barrier Reef Foundation -- which will administer the funds to different projects. The government insists it met the relevant guidelines, and says it welcomes an audit into the process.

Critics also say that the money should have been spent on tackling climate change.

"Coral bleaching is driven by carbon dioxide -- unless you stop pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it'll go on. It's as simple as that," Veron says.

The funding won't be wasted, though, Veron says, as scientists will be able to create a sort of seed bank for corals, to preserve the species until the climate is stable enough to rebuild the reefs.

The reef is a center of spectacular biodiversity.

"What the scientists hope to do is to help nature along a bit if they can, and that is to do all we can to repopulate, help the corals, after the big carbon dioxide increase is over and it starts to come down," he says.

For all his dire predictions for the future of the planet, he thinks humans were destined to take this path.

"It's part of being human to not worry about the long-term future," he says. "We're genetically programmed like that ... we just don't think ahead."

Nepal is a former monarchy that is now a federal democratic republic with multiple political parties.

About three-fourths of its terrain is mountainous.

Eight of the world's 10 tallest mountains are along Nepal's border. Mt. Everest's summit is 8,848 meters above sea level, the highest spot on Earth. Kanchenjunga, which straddles Nepal and India, is the third-highest mountain in the world.

Nepal's flag is the only one in the world that is neither square nor rectangular. The shape is formed from two connected pennants.

Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha, was born in Lumbini , now part of Nepal, around the sixth century BC.

Timeline:

Pre-18th century - Nepal is divided into small kingdoms.

1768 - Gorkha ruler Prithvi Narayan Shah becomes ruler of the entire valley, uniting the kingdoms of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhadgaon. The king declares Kathmandu to be the capital in 1769.

1814-1816 - Nepal and the British East India Company war over lands in the Terai, or the lowlands. Nepal signs the Treaty of Sagauli in 1816, ceding about one-third of its territory.

1846 - Jang Bahadur stages a coup and becomes prime minister. He eventually sets up a dictatorship by turning the monarchy into a government figurehead, establishing the hereditary rule of his family. The family, which adopts the honorific title of Rana (monarch), rules for more than 100 years (until 1951), leading to the isolation and economic underdevelopment of the country.

1857 - The Sepoy Rebellion against the British begins in India. Bahadur takes thousands of troops in to support the British, helping to quell the revolt and sealing Britain's support of his rule in Nepal and beginning a tradition of Gurkhas serving in the British Army.

January 15, 1934 - An earthquake with a magnitude of 8.1 occurs in Nepal-Bihar, India, killing 10,700 people.

1948 - After India gains its independence from Britain in 1947, Nepal's leaders lose crucial support and are pressured to introduce reforms. The prime minister announces the first constitution of Nepal, which calls for a state legislature with two chambers, an independent high court, and a prime minister with executive power, assisted by a council of at least five ministers, but the constitution is soon suspended amid opposition from conservative Ranas.

November 1950 - Revolt begins against the Rana regime as the Nepali Congress Party's Liberation Army engage soldiers in the Terai.

February 1951 - The Rana era of rule comes to an end as King Tribhuvan is restored to the throne after the last Rana oligarch, Mohan Shamsher, agrees to hold elections.

May 29, 1953 - Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay of Nepal are the first to reach the summit of Mt. Everest.

December 14, 1955 - Nepal joins the Nepal joins the United Nations.

February 18, 1959 - The first national elections are held, and the Nepali Congress Party wins. B.P. Koirala later becomes prime minister.

December 1960 - King Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Deva seizes power, suspends the parliament and key parts of the constitution.

January 1972 - King Mahendra dies and is succeeded by Birendra.

May 1991 - G.P. Koirala, the brother of Nepal's first elected prime minister (in 1959) is appointed to head the government after the Nepali Congress wins a majority (110 of 205 seats) in parliament in general elections. The moderate Communist Party of Nepal ends with a strong position as opposition with 69 seats.

1994 - The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) is founded and party leader Manmohan Adhhikari voted into power after Prime Minister G.P. Koirala resigns and recommends new parliamentary elections to the king.

1995 - Prime Minister Manmohan Adhhikari resigns after being accused of favoring his party members. The communist government is dissolved by Parliament.

1996 - A Maoist insurgency sets off a 10-year civil war, and by 2000, almost two-thirds of the country is affected by the strife.

June 1, 2001 - Crown Prince Dipendra goes on an alcohol and drug-fueled shooting rampage during a party at the palace, killing nine people, including his father and mother, the king and queen. Dipendra dies three days later of self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

2006 - A UN -mediated peace accord is signed by the government of Nepal and the Maoists. According to the International Red Cross, some 15,000 people die and 1,300 are declared missing due to the 10-year civil war.

May 2008 - The monarchy comes to an end as the new assembly votes in favor of declaring Nepal a democratic republic.

July 21, 2008 - The country's first president, Ram Baran Yadav, is elected.

May 2009 - Pushpa Kamal Dahal resigns after the president overrules his decision to fire a senior military official. Communist leader Madhav Kumar Nepal is named the new prime minister.

June 2010 - Madhav Kumar Nepal resigns as prime minister amidst political pressure. He agrees to act as a caretaker until a new prime minister is elected.

February 2011 - Parliament elects Communist Party leader Jhalanath Khanal as the new prime minister.

August 2011 - Jhalanath Khanal resigns as prime minister, acknowledging he was unable to form a national consensus government and integrate former Maoist rebels. Baburam Bhattarai, 57, vice-chairman of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) becomes the fourth prime minister since Nepal became a republic in 2008.

May 2012 - Baburam Bhattarai resigns as prime minister, but stays on as caretaker.

March 2013 - President Ram Baran Yadav Chief Justice Khilraj Regmi is appointed prime minister until a new Constituent Assembly is elected.

November 2013 - Constituent Assembly elections are held which lead to Sushil Koirala, a cousin of B.P. Koirala, of the Nepali Congress party becoming prime minister in February 2014.

April 25, 2015 - A 7.8-magnitude A 7.8-magnitude earthquake strikes , less than 50 miles from Kathmandu. A 6.7-magnitude aftershock on April 26 adds to the damage. The death toll is over 8,000, and the number of people injured is more than 17,000, according to the National Emergency Operations Center.

October 28, 2015 - Nepal's parliament elects Bidhya Devi Bhandari, the country's first female president.
__label__world Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) The boy was left for nearly 20 hours before the ambulance could reach him. He was unable to move because a bullet had torn a hole through his abdomen. When the fighting finally subsided, he was driven the 130 kilometers north from Ghazni to Kabul and a specialized hospital that treats the war-wounded.

The boy, 12, became one of 50 cases the Italian nongovernmental organization Emergency treats on a daily basis in what has become the surgical center's busiest year on record.

At the entrance to the children's ward, a whiteboard lists the injuries: shrapnel, mine, shrapnel, shrapnel, mine, shrapnel, bullet, bullet, bullet, shrapnel, shotgun, bullet, shrapnel, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet. Children account for about 30% of all patients the hospital treats.

Doctors begin another round of surgery on a teen who had his arm torn off by a bomb. Surgeons say his is an average case.

The center treats victims from across the country, but in recent months, it's been the increasing violence in and around the capital that has affected even the most hardened staff members.

__label__world (CNN) Two journalists were among 20 people killed in Kabul in twin bomb attacks on a wrestling club on Wednesday, with the second blast targeting media and emergency services at the scene of the initial explosion.

The first attack took place around 6 p.m. local time when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive vest in the Maiwand Wrestling Club, according to deputy spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry, Nasrat Rahimi.

Private broadcaster Tolo News said two of its journalists, Samim Faramarz, 28 and Ramiz Ahmadi, 23, died when the second explosion, a car bomb, was detonated after emergency services, journalists and police arrived at the scene.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in the predominantly Shia Qala-e-Nazer neighborhood of Western Kabul.

More journalists have been killed in Afghanistan than any other country during 2018, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (CPJ).
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's second Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, receives a cooler public reception than nearly every nominee for the last four administrations, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Women are a driving force behind the tepid response, with fewer than three in 10 saying Kavanaugh ought to be confirmed.

Overall, 37% of Americans say they'd like to see the Senate vote in favor of his confirmation. Kavanaugh's support is the lowest in polling dating back to Robert Bork's nomination by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. That's lower support for Kavanaugh than similar public assessments of the unsuccessful nominations of Merrick Garland and Harriet Miers, as well as all successful nominees save David Souter, Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer, for whom equivalent data are not available. Slightly more, 40%, say the Senate should not vote to confirm Kavanaugh, while 22% have no opinion on the matter. And Americans' first impressions of the judge are mixed: 33% have a generally positive take, 27% neutral and 29% generally negative.

Republicans are broadly supportive of Kavanaugh: 74% would like to see him confirmed, while independents split 38% to 38% and Democrats largely oppose his nomination (67% say he should not be confirmed). Republicans and independents were each more supportive of Neil Gorsuch's confirmation in the first weeks of Trump's time in office (84% of Republicans and 47% of independents favored his confirmation).

Women, in particular, are notably opposed to Kavanaugh's nomination, and it's not just partisanship driving the difference. Just 28% of women say the Senate should vote in favor of confirming Kavanaugh, compared with 47% of men. That gender gap extends to Democrats (6% of Democratic women support confirmation vs. 22% of Democratic men), and independents (28% of women vs. 47% of men). There's a far smaller gap between GOP women (71%) and men (77%).

__label__world Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (CNN) When Wang Yijun put Ethiopia's most expensive real estate project on the market, he experienced a strange phenomenon. People preferred the lowest floors over those with panoramic city views. "Power cuts mean elevators in this city often don't work," explains Wang, the site manager. "So the bottom-floor flats became the most valuable. You won't see this pricing in any Chinese city."

Replicating China's urban model in Africa has its challenges, but with limited developable space in Addis Ababa -- the capital is surrounded by protected farmland -- Wang believes high-rise living, such as Tsehay Real Estate's $60 million Poli Lotus development, is inevitable.

Theodros Amdeberhan, an Ethiopian lawyer, last year bought a three-bedroom, fifth-floor apartment here for about 3.5 million birr ($127,000). "Local developers never deliver on time," says Amdeberhan. The complex opened in 2016, and so far 70% of lots have sold. "When Mr Wang offered me a good price, I didn't hesitate," he says.

With red lanterns swaying over its entrance, the palm-tree peppered compound of 13 towers could easily be in Shenzhen, Chongqing or the suburbs of Shanghai. It's the sort of Chinese-ification that permeates much of Addis.

Simply put, Addis Ababa is becoming the city that China built -- but at what diplomatic and economic cost?

A city without addresses

Located 2,355 meters above sea level, Addis Ababa is one of the highest capitals in the world. Officials say 2.7 million people call it home, but that's based on a census from 2007 . The real number is surely far bigger. Few buildings here have addresses, so taxi drivers operate by landmarks. And because Ethiopia was never colonized, barring a brief Italian occupation between 1936 and 1941 , Addis lacks the European infrastructure that underpins many African metropolises. "It was never planned to be a city," says Alexandra Thorer, an architect who lived in Addis as a child, and wrote her thesis on the city's urbanization.

By the turn of the 21st century, Addis' population had swelled and its dirt roads badly needed upgrading. At the same time, China was pursuing stronger ties with African nations -- in 2000, Beijing held the inaugural Forum on China-Africa Cooperation , now a triennial deal-making pow wow.

The Ethiopian government saw China as a model for development and courted it for infrastructure, says Ian Taylor, a professor in African political economics at the University of St. Andrews, in Scotland.

China also built the first Metro system in Sub-Saharan Africa in Addis. Its two lines cut through the heart of the city, and carry at least 30,000 passengers an hour, who pay 6 birr ($0.30) a ride. "I thought it would fail quite quickly," says Thorer, "but actually it's really well used."

"Addis has been radically transformed," says Taylor. "Huge skyscrapers are changing the whole profile of the city." A 46-story glass tower will be the tallest in Ethiopia when finished in 2020 by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation.

The city's most symbolic skyscraper is, of course, the futuristic African Union (AU) headquarters. Gifted to Addis by Beijing in 2012, the $200 million structure resembles nothing in Ethiopia.

"I didn't realize how Chinese it was until I went to China," says Janet Faith Adhiambo Ochieng, communications officer at the African Union. "Then I was like: 'Wow.'"

Getting in the red

In the early 2000s, Irish singer-songwriter Bono was part of a chorus of celebrities asking Western countries to cancel African debt, which was costing some governments three times more than healthcare. When the G8 agreed to waive $55 billion from mostly African accounts in 2005, Bono called it " a little piece of history ."

Fast forward a decade, and Africa owes China about $130 billion, according to the Johns Hopkins SAIS China-Africa Research Initiative -- money which has mainly been used to fund transport, power and mining projects.

The continent lags behind other developing regions in virtually all infrastructure sectors , be it electricity, road or railroad performance. "Western companies and organizations such as the IMF and World Bank weren't offering money for that type of stuff," Taylor says.

Ethiopia has taken at least $12.1 billion from Chinese creditors since 2000. But overall the country is $29 billion in the red -- it owes more collectively to the Middle East, the World Bank and others than to China. The same is true for the majority of African countries.

A report published this month by the Johns Hopkins SAIS China-Africa Research Initiative found that Chinese loans are " not currently a major contributor to debt distress in Africa ."

"We're emerging into a new phase of a China-centric world order," says Solange Chatelard, academic and research associate at the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium. "The former hegemonic powers are having a hard time adjusting to their decline."

Lina Benebdallah, assistant professor of politics and international affairs at Wake Forest University, North Carolina, however, cautions that the China-Africa relationship is "asymmetric." In 2016, for example, China exported $88 billion in goods to Africa , but only imported $40 billion from the continent.

And there are countries with worrying amounts of Chinese debt. In Djibouti, China holds 77% of national debt, while Zambia's $6.4 billion in Chinese loans represents the lion share of its commitments. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) told CNN via email that China has paid "high attention" to African debt situation, and is dedicated to "sustainable development."

Twisting Ethiopia's arm?

One of the big concerns around Chinese loans is debt-trap diplomacy -- the idea that Beijing will pressure countries that can't pay into exploitative deals.

At the imposing prime minister's office building in Addis Ababa, Arkebe Oqubay, a senior government minister, is adamant that Ethiopia hasn't seen any arm-twisting from China. "One of the unique things that makes Chinese funding quite attractive is they practice non-intervention in local politics," he says.

And Beijing has been demanding that African nations cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan, under its " One China Policy ," for decades he says -- debt or no debt.

Luke Patey, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute of International Studies, sees it differently. He cites the example of Sri Lanka as the "canary in the coal mine."

In 2010, Beijing invested $1.5 billion to build the Hambantota port. When Sri Lanka couldn't repay the debt, it signed a 99-year lease of the port with a Chinese state-owned company to service some of the billions it owed.

"If developing countries do not pay greater attention to how they manage their debt with China, we're going to see a growing number selling off large stakes in key sovereign assets," Patey says.

Another concern is national security. Earlier this year, French news outlet, Le Monde, alleged that Beijing had spied on the African Union through the computer systems it helped install. China's foreign ministry said the report was based on "groundless accusations" and the AU disregarded the allegations as "baseless." But the rumors raised eyebrows, as China builds symbolic political facilities across Africa.

"The Germans could have bugged that building," Ochieng says, pointing to the far more modest Peace and Security facility Angela Merkel's government gifted the AU in 2016. "But will the story that the Germans are watching Africa sell as well?"

The Peace and Security facility Angela Merkel's government gifted the AU in 2016.

When Western powers see a city like Addis Ababa awash with Chinese influence, there is the knee-jerk reaction that "China has an ulterior motive," says Benebdallah. But it's often the case, says Taylor, that Chinese companies don't face Western competition for construction contracts. Once Chinese firms have shipped their equipment, they may as well stay put and capitalize.

For Patey it's not that simple. When China finances roads, railways, and hydropower dams, he says, it stipulates that Chinese construction companies build them with Chinese concrete and steel. "Africa has served as a launching pad for Chinese ... companies to gain overseas experience," he adds. "It's where China Inc cuts its international teeth."

A MOFA spokesperson told CNN via email that Chinese companies in Africa operate "independently" and that the Chinese government is "committed to equal negotiations," and had no interest in "lecturing countries."

On a Friday afternoon at Poli Lotus, Theodros Amdeberhan's teenage son plays FIFA on the wide-screen TV, while the maid roasts coffee and a picture of the Eiffel Tower hangs over the sofa in their Chinese-built apartment.

When asked how he feels about the Chinese molding Addis Ababa in their country's own image, Amdeberhan says: "I once went to China and noticed that they have this way of building city centers that can incorporate all the needs of the people." With the higgledy piggledy chaos of unplanned Addis just beyond his window, he says it's an appealing concept.

'Explain this guy to me.' Because, as they looked at him, in one sense they admired him.

Yes, that is, ostensibly, about McCain. But it is also an indictment of our current politics -- and a road map on how we can fix what's broken.

The prevailing "value" of modern politics is partisanship: You are good if you are on my team. You are not just bad, but morally bankrupt, if you are on the other side. You are real if you are on my team and fake if you aren't. Anything the captain of my team says can be justified (and agreed with) because, well, they're the captain of my team. Anything the other team's captain says is wrong, by default, because they're the captain of the other team. There's no reason to listen to people on the other team. Or make friends with them. Or even be seen with them. They aren't on my team. Why would I do that?

President Donald Trump is the walking, talking epitome of the sanctification of partisanship over all our other, real, values. (Yes, the irony is not lost on me -- and should not be lost on you -- that the modern patron saint of partisanship is someone who has been, literally, a Democrat, an independent and a Republican all within the last decade or so.) This is a man who has declared, repeatedly, that the mainstream media is the "enemy of the people." A man who said his Democratic opponent in the 2016 election should be jailed. A man who has called elected officials of his own party who disagreed with him " incompetent ," " weak and ineffective " and " so bad ," among many other things. A man who, while McCain was home in Arizona fighting the brain cancer that eventually killed him, would use the story of McCain voting against health care repeal legislation to symbolize the Arizona senator's alleged backstabbing. ("One senator decided to put the thumb down," Trump would say in his standard stump speech. "That was not a good thing.")

To be clear: Trump doesn't take this if-you-aren't-with-me-you're-against-me view out of any sort of principles. After all, he made his living in the private sector as a deal-maker, someone who always saw compromise as possible -- even in the darkest of situations. And as I noted above, Trump has been all over the map in terms of his personal politics. This is not a man wedded to a certain, unwavering view of what's right in the world.

Trump has elevated pure, unstinting partisanship into a virtue because it works for him politically. The Republican base was mad as hell at its elected leaders who they believed were all too willing to compromise on core principles. And not just compromise, but compromise badly; conservatives have long believed that Democrats always got the best of Republicans when it came to the sort of last-minute deal-making that Congress made a habit of producing. Compromise as capitulation was a notion within conservative circles before Trump, but he seized the idea and turned it into gospel truth. Even being seen with a member of the opposite party has become enough to draw a Republican incumbent a primary challenge from someone in their home state, insisting that the elected official has "gone Washington" or "come down with Potomac fever" or some other claptrap like that.

Now go back up and read Biden's words. And these words in particular (bolding is mine):

"It wasn't about politics with John. He could disagree on substance, but the underlying values that animated everything John did, everything he was, come to a different conclusion. He'd part company with you if you lacked the basic values of decency, respect, knowing this project is bigger than yourself."

When you read that last sentence, you understand why McCain was so openly critical of Trump, and why Trump disliked McCain in turn. McCain believed in the idea of public service as a noble -- flawed, but nonetheless noble -- profession. That the reason you got into politics was to find ways to do good, not for yourself but for the broader populace. That the most important lesson to always, always, always remember is that we all have a lot more in common than we have differences on. That focusing on that common humanity was at the essence of how politics should work. It wasn't about what team you were on. It was about what good you wanted to do -- and for whom.

That shared humanity -- the sense that we are all, in the end, in this together -- hasn't disappeared.

It can't disappear because it's who we, at root, are. What's wrong is that we just aren't looking hard enough for it. We are too willing to allow ourselves to be manipulated by people who, for whatever reasons -- political and monetary gain, mostly -- have a vested interest in focusing on what divides us rather than what unites us.

I'm under no illusion that either McCain's death (and life) or Biden's paean to re-find what McCain represented will have any immediate effect on the body politic. It's easier to retreat into partisan camps and surround yourself with people, TV talkers and the like who tell you that you're right (about everything) and those who disagree with you are your enemies, villains to be vanquished.

In the end, though, I'm with Biden and McCain. Who we are might get obscured. We might forget. But those are temporary matters. In the end, our eyes will open and our minds will remember.
__label__politics (CNN) A Senate committee abruptly postponed a vote Wednesday on a bill to protect elections against cyber threats after it became clear it would not have enough Republican votes to be approved and advance to the floor.

The move frustrated the bill's bipartisan authors who insisted Congress must respond to cyberattacks from Russia and other players by passing their legislation. Concerns over election security have increased as more details of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election have been made public.

"Congressional inaction is unacceptable," said Republican Sen. James Lankford from Oklahoma

Rules Chairman Roy Blunt, the Republican senator from Missouri, explained committee action was scuttled after secretaries of state from around the country raised concerns with aspects of the bill.

"We didn't have the level of Republican support we needed, and we didn't have some secretaries of state that had raised real concerns the last three days and (there was) no reason to go forward if we're not going to have enough bipartisan support to get a bill on the floor," Blunt said.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum on Sunday said a robocall aimed at mocking his race was "deeply regrettable" and took aim at his Republican opponent for saying Florida voters should not "monkey this up" by electing Gillum.

The 78-second prerecorded message , obtained by CNN, is narrated by a man speaking in a caricature of a black dialect with cartoonish jungle noises in the background. It ends with a disclaimer that it was paid for by The Road to Power, a white supremacist and anti-Semitic video podcast hosted by Scott Rhodes of Idaho.

The phone message went to Florida residents, but it's unclear how many received it. The Tallahassee Democrat first reported the robocall.

Asked about the robocall, Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, told CNN's "State of the Union, "I have to tell you I find this deeply regrettable."

Stephen Lawson, a spokesman for Gillum's Republican opponent, Rep. Ron DeSantis, condemned the call, calling it "absolutely appalling and disgusting" and saying the campaign "will continue to focus solely on the issues that Floridians care about and uniting our state."

(CNN) At FBI field offices and CIA stations around the world, our nation's intelligence professionals turned on their televisions Monday and witnessed their own commander in chief take to the airwaves and completely undermine their work.

Standing next to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki , President Donald Trump skirted a question from a reporter about whether he would denounce Russian interference in the 2016 election by instead invoking former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and attacking the FBI.

Apropos of nothing, but clearly using it as an opportunity to sidestep the difficult question at hand, Trump brought up Clinton's use of a private email server and seemed to peddle his favorite conspiracy theory about how thoroughly the FBI actually conducted the investigation of Clinton and the hacking of the DNC's emails.

Most astonishing, President Trump then went on to cast doubt on the conclusions of his own intelligence community and offer a moral equivalency between Putin -- a former KGB operative who has long worked against America's national security -- and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.

DNI Coates "said they think it's Russia," the President remarked , describing the moment US officials advised him they assessed the Kremlin was involved in interfering with our sacred electoral process. "I have President Putin; he just said it's not Russia," Trump then offered.

Insisting his options in finding out the truth were limited, "all I can do is ask the question," the President said with a shrug.

Setting aside for a moment that Putin's experience as a former spy would certainly equip him with the skills to look Trump in the eye and lie without blinking, it is beyond appalling that Trump would then give equal weight to the protests of a hostile foreign adversary, and in doing so undermine his own country's national security professionals.

The notion that Russia interfered in the 2016 US election is not a seriously disputed fact. In its public report on efforts to undermine the American electoral system, the US intelligence community did not mince words. "We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election" appears in bold letters in the document.

Rather than accepting the conclusions of his own intelligence professionals or simply claiming ignorance, Trump offered his own analytical assessment , stating that he doesn't see a reason why Russia would have meddled. In doing so, he succeeded in driving a wedge between his White House and the career intelligence professionals who go to work every single day working to keep America safe.

Had President Trump actually read the findings of his intelligence community, he would know exactly why Putin sought to subvert American democracy. "Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency," the report explicitly states

More than simply embarrassing our intelligence professionals, the President actually dealt a blow to their credibility by casting them as either incompetent or alarmists. Criticizing the quality of their assessment in this instance will likely cascade across other important national security issues. If the President succeeds in undercutting public confidence in our intelligence institutions, he will simply be able to ignore any future conclusions he finds uncomfortable.

In my judgment, the reason Trump seems to avoid educating himself on the topic of Russian interference is because he is no doubt concerned where such an inquiry might lead. I don't know whether he is simply unwilling to admit that his presidency is unwittingly the beneficiary of a foreign spy operation, or whether the Russians have compromising information on Trump, as others have suggested

I do know that politicians like Trump are keenly aware of the adage that you don't ask questions you don't want answered.

For our part, we may never know what fully motivates him to shun his own intelligence professionals while cozying up to an adversary, but that won't stop us from working to unearth the truth. To borrow a phrase from the President, all we can do is ask the question.

Letter of His Holiness Pope Francis to the People of God

Pope Francis

"If one member suffers, all suffer together with it" (1 Cor 12:26). These words of Saint Paul forcefully echo in my heart as I acknowledge once more the suffering endured by many minors due to sexual abuse, the abuse of power and the abuse of conscience perpetrated by a significant number of clerics and consecrated persons. Crimes that inflict deep wounds of pain and powerlessness, primarily among the victims, but also in their family members and in the larger community of believers and nonbelievers alike. Looking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient. Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated. The pain of the victims and their families is also our pain, and so it is urgent that we once more reaffirm our commitment to ensure the protection of minors and of vulnerable adults.

1. If one member suffers...

In recent days, a report was made public which detailed the experiences of at least a thousand survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately seventy years. Even though it can be said that most of these cases belong to the past, nonetheless as time goes on we have come to know the pain of many of the victims. We have realized that these wounds never disappear and that they require us forcefully to condemn these atrocities and join forces in uprooting this culture of death; these wounds never go away. The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced. But their outcry was more powerful than all the measures meant to silence it, or sought even to resolve it by decisions that increased its gravity by falling into complicity. The Lord heard that cry and once again showed us on which side he stands. Mary's song is not mistaken and continues quietly to echo throughout history. For the Lord remembers the promise he made to our fathers: "he has scattered the proud in their conceit; he has cast down the mighty from their thrones and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty" (Lk 1:51-53). We feel shame when we realize that our style of life has denied, and continues to deny, the words we recite.

With shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives. We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them. I make my own the words of the then Cardinal Ratzinger when, during the Way of the Cross composed for Good Friday 2005, he identified with the cry of pain of so many victims and exclaimed: "How much filth there is in the Church, and even among those who, in the priesthood, ought to belong entirely to [Christ]! How much pride, how much self-complacency! Christ's betrayal by his disciples, their unworthy reception of his body and blood, is certainly the greatest suffering endured by the Redeemer; it pierces his heart. We can only call to him from the depths of our hearts: Kyrie eleison -- Lord, save us! (cf. Mt 8:25)" (Ninth Station).

2. ... all suffer together with it

The extent and the gravity of all that has happened requires coming to grips with this reality in a comprehensive and communal way. While it is important and necessary on every journey of conversion to acknowledge the truth of what has happened, in itself this is not enough. Today we are challenged as the People of God to take on the pain of our brothers and sisters wounded in their flesh and in their spirit. If, in the past, the response was one of omission, today we want solidarity, in the deepest and most challenging sense, to become our way of forging present and future history. And this in an environment where conflicts, tensions and above all the victims of every type of abuse can encounter an outstretched hand to protect them and rescue them from their pain (cf. Evangelii Gaudium, 228). Such solidarity demands that we in turn condemn whatever endangers the integrity of any person. A solidarity that summons us to fight all forms of corruption, especially spiritual corruption. The latter is "a comfortable and self-satisfied form of blindness. Everything then appears acceptable: deception, slander, egotism and other subtle forms of self-centeredness, for 'even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light' (2 Cor 11:14)" (Gaudete et Exsultate, 165). Saint Paul's exhortation to suffer with those who suffer is the best antidote against all our attempts to repeat the words of Cain: "Am I my brother's keeper?" (Gen 4:9).

I am conscious of the effort and work being carried out in various parts of the world to come up with the necessary means to ensure the safety and protection of the integrity of children and of vulnerable adults, as well as implementing zero tolerance and ways of making all those who perpetrate or cover up these crimes accountable. We have delayed in applying these actions and sanctions that are so necessary, yet I am confident that they will help to guarantee a greater culture of care in the present and future.

Together with those efforts, every one of the baptized should feel involved in the ecclesial and social change that we so greatly need. This change calls for a personal and communal conversion that makes us see things as the Lord does. For as Saint John Paul II liked to say: "If we have truly started out anew from the contemplation of Christ, we must learn to see him especially in the faces of those with whom he wished to be identified" (Novo Millennio Ineunte, 49). To see things as the Lord does, to be where the Lord wants us to be, to experience a conversion of heart in his presence. To do so, prayer and penance will help. I invite the entire holy faithful People of God to a penitential exercise of prayer and fasting, following the Lord's command.1 This can awaken our conscience and arouse our solidarity and commitment to a culture of care that says "never again" to every form of abuse.

It is impossible to think of a conversion of our activity as a Church that does not include the active participation of all the members of God's People. Indeed, whenever we have tried to replace, or silence, or ignore, or reduce the People of God to small elites, we end up creating communities, projects, theological approaches, spiritualities and structures without roots, without memory, without faces, without bodies and ultimately, without lives. 2 This is clearly seen in a peculiar way of understanding the Church's authority, one common in many communities where sexual abuse and the abuse of power and conscience have occurred. Such is the case with clericalism, an approach that "not only nullifies the character of Christians, but also tends to diminish and undervalue the baptismal grace that the Holy Spirit has placed in the heart of our people".3

Clericalism, whether fostered by priests themselves or by lay persons, leads to an excision in the ecclesial body that supports and helps to perpetuate many of the evils that we are condemning today. To say "no" to abuse is to say an emphatic "no" to all forms of clericalism.

It is always helpful to remember that "in salvation history, the Lord saved one people. We are never completely ourselves unless we belong to a people. That is why no one is saved alone, as an isolated individual. Rather, God draws us to himself, taking into account the complex fabric of interpersonal relationships present in the human community. God wanted to enter into the life and history of a people" (Gaudete et Exsultate, 6). Consequently, the only way that we have to respond to this evil that has darkened so many lives is to experience it as a task regarding all of us as the People of God. This awareness of being part of a people and a shared history will enable us to acknowledge our past sins and mistakes with a penitential openness that can allow us to be renewed from within. Without the active participation of all the Church's members, everything being done to uproot the culture of abuse in our communities will not be successful in generating the necessary dynamics for sound and realistic change. The penitential dimension of fasting and prayer will help us as God's People to come before the Lord and our wounded brothers and sisters as sinners imploring forgiveness and the grace of shame and conversion. In this way, we will come up with actions that can generate resources attuned to the Gospel. For "whenever we make the effort to return to the source and to recover the original freshness of the Gospel, new avenues arise, new paths of creativity open up, with different forms of expression, more eloquent signs and words with new meaning for today's world" (Evangelii Gaudium, 11).

It is essential that we, as a Church, be able to acknowledge and condemn, with sorrow and shame, the atrocities perpetrated by consecrated persons, clerics, and all those entrusted with the mission of watching over and caring for those most vulnerable. Let us beg forgiveness for our own sins and the sins of others. An awareness of sin helps us to acknowledge the errors, the crimes and the wounds caused in the past and allows us, in the present, to be more open and committed along a journey of renewed conversion.

Likewise, penance and prayer will help us to open our eyes and our hearts to other people's sufferings and to overcome the thirst for power and possessions that are so often the root of those evils. May fasting and prayer open our ears to the hushed pain felt by children, young people and the disabled. A fasting that can make us hunger and thirst for justice and impel us to walk in the truth, supporting all the judicial measures that may be necessary. A fasting that shakes us up and leads us to be committed in truth and charity with all men and women of good will, and with society in general, to combatting all forms of the abuse of power, sexual abuse and the abuse of conscience.

In this way, we can show clearly our calling to be "a sign and instrument of communion with God and of the unity of the entire human race" (Lumen Gentium, 1).

"If one member suffers, all suffer together with it", said Saint Paul. By an attitude of prayer and penance, we will become attuned as individuals and as a community to this exhortation, so that we may grow in the gift of compassion, in justice, prevention and reparation. Mary chose to stand at the foot of her Son's cross. She did so unhesitatingly, standing firmly by Jesus' side. In this way, she reveals the way she lived her entire life. When we experience the desolation caused by these ecclesial wounds, we will do well, with Mary, "to insist more upon prayer", seeking to grow all the more in love and fidelity to the Church (SAINT IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA, Spiritual Exercises, 319). She, the first of the disciples, teaches all of us as disciples how we are to halt before the sufferings of the innocent, without excuses or cowardice. To look to Mary is to discover the model of a true follower of Christ.

May the Holy Spirit grant us the grace of conversion and the interior anointing needed to express before these crimes of abuse our compunction and our resolve courageously to combat them.

FRANCIS

Vatican City, 20 August 2018
__label__world (CNN) Last year was one of the hottest in recorded history, according to a new study released Wednesday by the American Meteorological Society.

The report is another piece of compelling evidence that our planet is warming faster than at any point in modern history. It's the 28th version of the annual checkup for the planet and updates numerous global climate indicators such as polar ice, oceans and extreme weather events around the world.

The State of the Climate in 2017 report , led by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Centers for Environmental Information, was compiled using contributions from more than 500 scientists in more than 60 countries.

The fact that 2017 was either the second- or third-hottest year, depending on the dataset used, does not come as a surprise. It follows a string of record hot years in 2014, 2015 and 2016 -- and while 2017 did not provide a fourth consecutive record, it was the hottest non-El Niño year seen.

El Niño, which is characterized by a warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean , tends to warm up the entire planet during years when it occurs.

Conversely, when La Niña is active, it tends to provide some natural air-conditioning for the planet as large portions of the Pacific Ocean cool to below average temperatures. Even though 2017 had a weak La Niña present in the beginning and end of the year, it failed to regulate the planet's high temperature caused by ever-increasing amounts of greenhouse gas concentrations.

The major greenhouse gasses, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide, all rose to record high amounts in our atmosphere during 2017, according to the report.

The global average carbon dioxide concentration was 405.0 parts per million (ppm), which is the highest ever recorded and also higher than at any point in the last 800,000 years, according to ice-core data.

Oceans heating, rising

The oceans are also heating up, with significant planet-altering consequences.

The global average sea surface temperatures were near a record high, just slightly below the record from 2016, and the last three years have seen the hottest on record.

JUST WATCHED If coral reefs disappear, so will they Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH If coral reefs disappear, so will they 06:08

Warm seas equal rising seas, and 2017 set a new record for global sea level -- which has risen year over year for six consecutive years and 22 of the last 24 years. Global sea level is rising at an average rate of 1.2 inches (3.1 cm) per decade, and that rate has been even higher in the most recent decades as sea-level rise accelerates.

Unprecedented coral bleaching also occurred during 2017, according to the report, which was the most widespread and destructive ever observed with hundreds of miles of corals in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Ocean basins experiencing up to 95% mortality in the hardest-hit reefs.

Both poles see record low ice

Both the Arctic and the Antarctic saw record low levels of sea ice during 2017, as warmer air and sea surface temperatures continued the trend of thinning out the polar ice.

"Today's abnormally warm Arctic air and sea surface surface temperatures have not been observed in the last 2,000 years," the study said.

In March of 2017, at the end of the ice-growing season when the coverage of sea ice in the Arctic reached its maximum extent of the year, scientists found it was the smallest yearly maximum in the 37-year record.

In the Antarctic, sea ice was below average for all of 2017, hitting record lows during the first four months of 2017 . On March 1 it hit a record low extent since satellites began observing the ice in 1978.

As for land ice, the news continues to be grim, which is bad news for global sea levels as melting glaciers are a significant contributor to rising ocean levels.

Glaciers across the globe lost ice mass for the 38th consecutive year -- with declines "remarkably consistent" across all regions of the planet according to the report. To put the amount of ice lost since 1980 into perspective, the report states that "the loss is equivalent to slicing 22 meters (more than 70 feet) off the top of the average glacier."

Extreme storms and rainfall

"Climate is not experienced in annual averages," the report states, even though that is how we most often monitor and gauge the changes in our planet's climate variability -- both natural and human-influenced.

"Humans experience climate change and variability most deeply in the form of impacts and extremes," according to the report --- and 2017 certainly had plenty of them.

Even though globally tropical cyclone (hurricanes, typhoons, tropical storms, etc.) numbers were about average in 2017, the North Atlantic basin had one of it's busiest years on record with three standout hurricanes.

Hurricane Harvey dumped record rainfall totals in Texas and Louisiana, including a new US record of 60.5 inches (1,538 mm) which smashed the old record of 52 inches (1,320 mm).

Right on it's heels came Hurricane Irma , which became the strongest tropical cyclone globally of the year and the strongest Atlantic hurricane outside of the warmest waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean.

Hurricane Maria immediately followed, bringing catastrophic damage across the Caribbean Islands including devastating the landscape and infrastructure of Puerto Rico.

Notable, deadly floods hit every continent except Antarctica -- with India floods claiming 800 lives, Venezuela experienced its most devastating flooding in more than a decade, and flooding of the Niger and Benue Rivers in Nigeria displaced more than 100,000 people.

Global fire activity was the lowest since at least 2003, but extreme droughts in a few key locations led to a number of devastating fire seasons globally.

In the US, an extreme western wildfire season saw over 4 million hectares burned, costing $18 billion -- which tripled the previous US annual wildfire cost record from 1991. Just to the north, Canada's British Columbia saw 1.2 million hectares burn during their driest summer on record.
__label__world (CNN) Puerto Rico's true death toll from Hurricane Maria remains elusive as the storm's one-year anniversary approaches.

The island government raised the official death toll to 2,975 on Tuesday after maintaining for months that 64 people had died as a result of the storm.

But the higher figure, based on the findings of researchers from George Washington University in a study commissioned by the US commonwealth's government, is only an approximation, not a concrete list of names, according to Gov. Ricardo Rossello.

"This number can change," Rossello said. "It could be less, it could be more, as time passes."

Here's how the official death toll has changed since the storm touched down September 20 as a Category 4 hurricane:

The main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa brought a case before the court to contest his loss at the poll, which he said was "fraudulent and illegal."

"The application is dismissed with cause," the judge said as he upheld Mnangagwa's victory Friday.

His inauguration is expected to go ahead Sunday, Patrick Chinamasa, the country's finance minister said.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Years after defecting from Russia and resettling in the US, former KGB officer Alexander Zaporozhsky was lured back to the country he had once betrayed. The CIA warned him not to go.

Several senior intelligence officials tried unsuccessfully to dissuade Zaporozhsky, who had given the US valuable information that ultimately led to the capture of FBI agent and Russian spy Robert Hanssen, former officials familiar with the case told CNN.

But the Russian intelligence officer turned US asset insisted on returning to Moscow in 2001. He was arrested and imprisoned in Siberia for his connections to the West.

Zaporozhsky was ultimately released in 2010 and sent back to the US as part of a spy swap with Russia that also included Sergei Skripal, a former KGB colonel convicted of spying for Britain after admitting to the crime. The US released 10 individuals accused of operating a Russian spy ring in the US as part of the exchange.

The former KGB officer has largely flown under the radar since his release and his whereabouts remain a secret, but Skripal's name publicly resurfaced in March when he was poisoned with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury -- an incident that the UK and US allege was the work of the Russian government. Russia denies any involvement.

'Crown jewels of human intelligence collection'

Human intelligence collection and the CIA's recruitment of foreign spies was crucial to US efforts in the Cold War and continues to play a major role in the evolving world of global espionage.

On one hand, intelligence agencies like the CIA are constantly working to identify and apprehend foreign agents operating within the US on behalf of aggressive adversaries like Russia, China and Iran -- a concern highlighted by the ongoing criminal prosecution of 29-year-old Maria Butina, an alleged Russian operative.

Butina has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent in the US. Her lawyer, Robert Driscoll, told CNN Wednesday that she wouldn't take a deal from prosecutors if it meant admitting she was a spy.

But the flipside is a shadow world where defectors like Zaporozhsky and Skripal are the ultimate trophy -- and take the ultimate risk.

In the US, a CIA program focuses on secretly rescuing and resettling spies like them who are in danger of being caught or killed for betraying their country in service to Washington.

The risks don't stop once they've reached US shores, former intelligence officials told CNN, as their former countries often continue to hunt them down. Those challenges have only gotten tougher as cyber capabilities advance and the evolution of social media make the task of protecting defectors even more difficult.

"For decades, high-level defectors have been the crown jewels of human intelligence collection," according to Joe Augustyn, a retired CIA officer who ran the defectors program for three years.

"Given the technology available to our adversaries and difficulty of hiding in plain sight -- the challenge the CIA has of protecting the spies among us has never been greater," Augustyn said. "Protecting these individuals who have betrayed their countries to help ours is even more important and challenging today than it was during the Cold War."

Here's a quick look at who got caught and how they were punished. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Spying on their own countries Harold James Nicholson – After what looked like a successful 16 years in the CIA, Harold James "Jim" Nicholson was caught selling secrets to Russia. He was convicted on espionage charges in 1997 and sentenced to 23 years in prison. In 2011, Nicholson's son Nathaniel was charged after meeting with Russian agents to collect money owed to his father. He was sentenced to five years probation. As a result, Harold Nicholson was sentenced to an additional eight years in prison on charges of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Spying on their own countries Aldrich Ames – Aldrich Ames, a 31-year CIA employee, pleaded guilty to espionage charges in 1994 and was sentenced to life in prison. Ames was a CIA case worker who specialized in Soviet intelligence services and had been passing classified information to the KGB since 1985. US intelligence officials believe that information passed along by Ames led to the arrest and execution of Russian officials they had recruited to spy for them. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: Spying on their own countries Jonathan Pollard – Jonathan Pollard is a divisive figure in US-Israeli relations. The former US Navy intelligence analyst was caught spying for Israel in 1985 and was sentenced in 1987 to life imprisonment. Previously, the United States and Israel discussed his possible release as part of efforts to save fragile Middle East peace negotiations, according to sources familiar with the talks. In 2015, Pollard was released on parole -- 30 years after his arrest. Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: Spying on their own countries Robert Hanssen – Robert Hanssen pleaded guilty to espionage charges in 2001 in return for the government not seeking the death penalty. Hanssen began spying for the Soviet Union in 1979, three years after going to work for the FBI, and prosecutors said he collected $1.4 million for the information he turned over to the Cold War enemy. In 1981, Hanssen's wife caught him with classified documents and convinced him to stop spying, but he started passing secrets to the Soviets again four years later. In 1991, he broke off relations with the KGB, but resumed his espionage career in 1999, this time with the Russian Intelligence Service. He was arrested after making a drop in a Virginia park in 2001.

He was a Navy communications specialist with financial difficulties when he walked into the Soviet Embassy and sold a piece of cyphering equipment. Navy and Defense officials said that Walker enabled the Soviet Union to unscramble military communications and pinpoint the location of US submarines at all times. As part of his plea deal, prosecutors promised leniency for Walker's son Michael Walker, a former Navy seaman. Michael Walker was released in 2000 after serving 15 years in prison.

Former CIA director Gen. Michael Hayden told CNN that defectors don't just help with current or past intelligence.

"We have found that defectors are a long-term and deep source of information and that they enlighten things we may have already collected but not understood, as well as those things we might collect in the future," Hayden said.

While the CIA intentionally maintains a level of operational secrecy to protect defectors, events like Skripal's poisoning are a reminder that the stakes are as high as ever for those who participate in clandestine operations and the handlers responsible for their well-being.

"When I would speak at the graduation of CIA case officers, I would remind them of the moral responsibility they had to anyone they would recruit," Hayden said. "That individual was putting his or her welfare and that of their entire family into the case officer's hands. And the case officer might be the only face of America that source might ever see."

Hiding in plain sight

The CIA's defector program has existed since 1949 when Congress passed a law authorizing the agency to resettle up to 100 foreign nationals in the US if it's "in the interest of national security or essential to the furtherance of the national intelligence mission."

While the CIA doesn't take advantage of the full quota that is allowed each year, the reality is that there are hundreds of former spies living in the US with new identities -- resettled into communities across the country.

The dozens of CIA officials who work for the defector program are responsible for keeping track of those individuals and advising them as best they can for the rest of their lives -- all the while knowing that foreign adversaries continue to aggressively search for them.

Indications that Russia was behind Skripal's poisoning provides further evidence that Moscow remains particularly vigilant in their quest to find those who betray the motherland -- at times demonstrating a unique willingness to patiently wait for the opportunity to retaliate.

"As we have seen recently in the UK, the risk to these defectors does not end when they reach the west. It is critical that US intelligence does all that it can to make sure they live safe and productive lives not only as a 'thank you' for what they have done -- but also as a message to future defectors that the United States lives up to its commitments," Augustyn said.

Not every spy qualifies for exfiltration, but the US will work to rescue high-ranking military officials, intelligence officers, academics, scientists and other workers with access to sensitive information who are at imminent risk of being caught or captured.

If the defector is successfully brought out of their home country, often in the dead of night, he or she and their family will be given new names, English lessons, some money, a house, and words of advice: don't use social media, don't contact anyone back home.

In one case, the CIA helped a man who wanted to go to college by providing fake records he needed to apply, while in another, officers facilitated a secret divorce for an asset whose wife still lived in the country he defected from.

Psychiatrists work in the special unit as well, to help families adjust to their new surroundings.

Those guidelines aren't always followed.

Some of the children of former spies have been unable to resist social media, and there have been defectors who have returned to their home countries after failing to adjust to life in the US.

One former spy sued the agency for failing to provide his family with sufficient funds, and the case escalated all the way to the Supreme Court -- which found in the CIA's favor, thanks to a long-forgotten Civil War-era law concerning secret agreements called the Totten Doctrine that protected Abraham Lincoln from being sued by a spy he paid to follow Confederate soldiers.

Complex challenges

Defectors present a myriad of psychological and logistical challenges for CIA handlers as they navigate the complex reality of life-long resettlement.

Some defectors maintain an "unnaturally strong belief of their own invulnerability" that can manifest itself years into the program -- a trait that often makes them targets of coercion and can have potentially fatal consequences, according to Augustyn.

Other individuals cannot reconcile themselves to the fact that they are no longer the person they used to be, he added.

"Anyone who betrays their country, for whatever reason, is different," Augustyn told CNN, adding that these individuals often have strong egos and are motivated by personal reasons like greed or a desire for revenge rather than political ideology or a desire to make the world a better place.

And while the CIA provides defectors with new identities and professions, the jobs given are often a dramatic step-down from the high-level military, political or intelligence professions that made them attractive recruitment targets in the first place.

One high-level defector even became a pizza deliveryman upon resettling in the US, according to Augustyn.

That change in lifestyle can be jarring for defectors and their families who are forced to abandon parts of their life that long served as the foundation of their identity.

"Each case is unique," Peter Earnest, a 35-year CIA veteran who helped resettle multiple former Soviet officials in the US, told CNN. But "people who have served us in difficult circumstances, we owe them an obligation," he added.

Russia is not the only foreign adversary interested in tracking down defectors living in the US. The CIA has resettled individuals from countries like China, Iran and North Korea and those countries also want to track down those they believe have betrayed their interests.

While CIA officials would not say whether the US has noticed a recent increase in the targeting of defectors, intelligence officers constantly evaluate safety concerns of those spies secretly living in the US.

The CIA's defector program remains sensitive, and few people, including lawmakers and former intelligence officials, will discuss it, but those who will say the defectors program it helps the US extract valuable assets from dangerous situations, promoting loyalty and creating an incentive for anyone considering choosing to spy for the US in the future.

"Beyond the moral compulsion to do right by defectors, the nation that does not protect those who defect will find that fewer people will be making that choice," Hayden told CNN.

But while the CIA has successfully resettled hundreds of former spies over a span of several decades, many cases have ended in tragedy.

Since the program was founded after World War II, several defectors from Eastern Bloc countries alone have been assassinated or disappeared under suspicious circumstances.

The CIA is still searching for answers related to the case of Ryszard Kuklinksi, a Polish army colonel who gave the US thousands of documents revealing sensitive information about the Soviet nuclear weapons program -- he was exfiltrated from Poland by the CIA just before the Polish government instituted martial law in 1981.

Kuklinski lived peacefully in Florida for many years after leaving Poland and was celebrated as a hero within the US intelligence community for dramatically improving their understanding of Soviet weaponry in the 70s and 80s.

However, his two sons mysteriously died within six months of each other in 1994 -- one lost at sea off the coast of Florida and the second hit by a car, which burned up and left behind no evidence of the perpetrator. The mystery remains unsolved, though many have pointed the finger at angry KGB agents seeking retribution.
__label__world Paris (CNN) French President Emmanuel Macron told France's overseas ambassadors gathered in Paris on Monday that Europe can "no longer rely" upon the US for its security.

"It is up to us today to take our responsibilities and guarantee our own security, and thus have European sovereignty," Macron said.

Since his election in 2016, US President Donald Trump has been distancing himself from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, challenging a post-World War Two consensus on peace and security in Europe.

Macron said he wanted to see a complete rethink of how Europe defends itself in the future.

"I want us to launch an exhaustive review of our security with all Europe's partners, which includes Russia," he added.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, said Wednesday that bureaucracy and inefficiency across local and federal government entities are to blame for the deaths of nearly 3,000 on the island in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which came to light as part of a newly released study commissioned by the Puerto Rican government.

In particular, Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz blamed President Donald Trump, federal officials and Puerto Rican officials for not providing more assistance in what the Puerto Rican government now acknowledges was a storm more deadly than Hurricane Katrina.

"You know, everybody is responsible because there were people in power that had the opportunity to request more aid, to request more aid when it was reasonable, to request more aid when it was needed, to tell the truth and they didn't," Yulín Cruz told CNN "New Day" host Alisyn Camerota. "It's 2,975 people and they're still calling it an estimate -- 2,975 people that will never see the light of day and many of them died because of what was done by the administration and that was silently approved by most of the political class in Puerto Rico."

"The administration killed the Puerto Ricans with neglect. The Trump administration led us to believe they were helping when they weren't up to par, and they didn't allow other countries to help us," Yulín Cruz said, later adding, "Shame on President Trump. Shame on President Trump for not even once, not even yesterday, just saying, 'Look, I grieve with the people of Puerto Rico.'"

In a statement Tuesday following the Puerto Rican government's decision to raised the death toll, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump "remains proud of all of the work the Federal family undertook to help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico."

__label__politics "Back in the day, he could frustrate me. And I know he'd say the same thing about me. But he also made me better," Bush said.

Read the full transcript:

Cindy and the McCain Family, I am honored to be with you to offer my sympathies and to celebrate a great life. The nation joins your extraordinary family in grief and gratitude for John McCain.

Some lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended. Some voices are so vibrant and distinctive, it is hard to think of them stilled. A man who seldom rested is laid to rest. And his absence is tangible, like the silence after a mighty roar.

The thing about John's life was the amazing sweep of it. From a tiny prison cell in Vietnam to the floor of the United States Senate. From troublemaking plebe to presidential candidate. Wherever John passed throughout the world, people immediately knew there was a leader in their midst. In one epic life was written the courage and greatness of our country.

For John and me, there was a personal journey -- a hard-fought political history. Back in the day, he could frustrate me. (Laughter.) And I know he'd say the same thing about me. But he also made me better. In recent years, we sometimes talked of that intense period like football players remembering a big game. In the process, rivalry melted away. In the end, I got to enjoy one of life's great gifts: the friendship of John McCain. And I will miss him.

Moments before my last debate -- ever -- with Senator John Kerry in Phoenix, I was trying to gather some thoughts in the holding room. I felt a presence ... opened my eyes ... and six inches from my face was McCain, who yelled, "RELAX! RELAX!" (Laughter.)

John was, above all, a man with a code. He lived by a set of public virtues that brought strength and purpose to his life and to his country.

He was courageous -- with a courage that frightened his captors and inspired his countrymen.

He was honest, no matter whom it offended. Presidents were not spared. (Laughter.)

He was honorable -- always recognizing that his opponents were still patriots and human beings.

He loved freedom, with the passion of a man who knew its absence.

He respected the dignity inherent in every life -- a dignity that does not stop at borders and cannot be erased by dictators.

Perhaps above all, John detested the abuse of power. He could not abide bigots and swaggering despots. There was something deep inside him that made him stand up for the little guy -- to speak for forgotten people in forgotten places.

One friend from his Naval Academy days recalled how John -- while a lowly plebe -- reacted to seeing an upperclassman verbally abuse a steward. Against all tradition, he told the jerk to pick on someone his own size. It was a familiar refrain during his six decades of service.

Where did such strength of conviction come from? Perhaps from a family where honor was in the atmosphere. Or from the firsthand experience of cruelty, which left physical reminders that lasted his whole life. Or from some deep well of moral principle. Whatever the cause, it was this combination of courage and decency that defined John's calling -- and so closely paralleled the calling of his country.

It is this combination of courage and decency that makes the American military something new in history -- an unrivaled power for good. It is this combination of courage and decency that set America on a journey into the world -- to liberate death camps, to stand guard against extremism, and to work for the true peace that comes only with freedom.

John felt these commitments in his bones. It is a tribute to his moral compass that dissidents and prisoners in so many places -- from Russia, to North Korea, to China -- knew that he was on their side. And I think their respect meant more to him than any medals and honors life could bring.

This passion for fairness and justice extended to our own military. When a private was poorly equipped, or a seaman was overworked in terrible conditions, John enjoyed nothing more than dressing down an admiral or a general. He remained that troublesome plebe to the end. (Laughter.)

Those in political power were not exempt. At various points throughout his long career, John confronted policies and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country. To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: We are better than this. America is better than this.

John -- as he was the first to tell you -- was not a perfect man. But he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have yet conceived. He was motivated by a vision of America carried ever forward, ever upward, on the strength of its principles.

He saw our country not only as a physical place or power, but as the carrier of enduring human aspirations. As an advocate for the oppressed. As a defender of the peace. As a promise, unwavering, undimmed, unequaled.

The strength of a democracy is renewed by reaffirming the principles on which it was founded. And America somehow has always found leaders who were up to that task, particularly at times of greatest need. John was born to meet that kind of challenge -- to defend and demonstrate the defining ideals of our nation.

If we are ever tempted to forget who we are, to grow weary of our cause, John's voice will always come as a whisper over our shoulder: We are better than this. America is better than this.

John was a restless soul. He really didn't glory in success or wallow in failure, because he was always on to the next thing. A friend said, "He can't stand to stay in the same experience." One of his books ended with the words: "And I moved on."

John has moved on. He would probably not want us to dwell on it. But we are better for his presence among us. The world is smaller for his departure. And we will remember him as he was: unwavering, undimmed, unequaled.

__label__politics (CNN) The Federal Emergency Management Agency was so overwhelmed with other storms by the time Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico last year that more than half of the workers it was deploying to disasters were known to be unqualified for the jobs they were doing in the field.

That's one revelation from a Tuesday report from the US Government Accountability Office (GAO), which portrays a federal government stretched thin by successive disasters to hit the United States and its territories last year. Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico followed Harvey and Irma -- all within 26 days of each other, according to the lead author of the report.

"By the time Maria hit Puerto Rico, they were down to the bottom of the barrel," Chris Currie, director of emergency management issues at the GAO told reporters in a conference call Tuesday. "They were having a struggle getting people there -- and not just people, but qualified people."

"The effect of this," Currie added, "is that during the response phase -- and especially during recovery -- these are the folks that are working with the territory and the state governments -- and they're not fully trained on FEMA's programs.

"A lot of the highly trained folks were deployed, not surprisingly, to Harvey and Texas," at least initially, he said.

__label__politics Mueller has actually made progress

Trump's argument that Mueller's probe hasn't found anything relating to Russia ignores the many indictments of Russians accused of trying to interfere in the US election. And it ignores the guilty pleas from a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who has admitted to lying to authorities and trying to set up meetings with Russians.

It ignores the infamous Trump Tower meeting between a Russian woman who was offering compromising information on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Mueller, by the way, is still very actively conducting his probe. More direct allegations of collusion with Russia could be on their way.

The law allows special counsels to uncover crimes as well as investigate them

But Trump's larger point is that Mueller's probe has evolved from its original purpose.

True, it was launched to find "any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump." But Mueller was specifically deputized to pursue "any matters that arose or may arise directly from that investigation." If you don't think Cohen's allegation that Trump orchestrated the payoffs of Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal rises to that level, there's more. The code by which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller goes further and says the special counsel has more jurisdiction:

"If in the course of his or her investigation the Special Counsel concludes that additional jurisdiction beyond that specified in his or her original jurisdiction is necessary in order to fully investigate and resolve the matters assigned, or to investigate new matters that come to light in the course of his or her investigation, he or she shall consult with the Attorney General, who will determine whether to include the additional matters within the Special Counsel's jurisdiction or assign them elsewhere."

It was under a different law, but this is the same principle by which a special counsel appointed during the Clinton administration started out investigating a land deal and ended up encouraging impeachment because of President Bill Clinton's statements under oath about his sexual relationship with a White House intern

This is a good place to point out that Cohen's guilty plea was engineered by the US Attorney in the Southern District of New York and not by Mueller's special counsel's office.

Mueller referred the case to the Southern District months ago, before a raid on Cohen's apartment.

Cohen's and Manafort's crimes are serious

But the biggest problem with Trump's "no collusion" defense is that he's trying to minimize the guilt of his former associates. It's not related to Russia, so it shouldn't have been prosecuted, essentially. But they were crimes, at least in the minds of Manafort's Alexandria, Virginia, jurors, who agreed on eight of 18 counts and could send the former Trump campaign chief away for the rest of his life. Along with guilty pleadings from former Trump campaign staffers George Papadopoulos and Rick Gates and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who are all cooperating with Mueller, the universe of Trump associates with the word "guilty" next to their names continues to grow.

That's a problem for those staffers and a serious problem for Trump, whose promise to hire only the best people seems questionable at best.

The hard reality of all those proven or admitted crimes, however, makes it very difficult for Trump to do anything but attack the credibility of the system. At some point he can no longer try to marginalize all the now-convicted criminals who worked for him. There are too many.

That's why he'll continue to claim it's all a big witch hunt, even though that claim is getting very hard to defend. He was praising Manafort on Tuesday, for instance, as a strong and honorable man who didn't "break" like Cohen.

"I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. 'Justice' took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to 'break' - make up stories in order to get a 'deal.' Such respect for a brave man!" Trump said

"Brave man" is a very interesting way to spin convicted tax fraud.

In the case of Cohen, the White House and Trump have argued the campaign finance charges he copped to shouldn't even be crimes.

"Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!" Trump said Wednesday on Twitter
__label__politics (CNN) The Senate Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, plans to introduce a resolution that would prevent the President from arbitrarily revoking security clearances, days after President Donald Trump revoked the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan.

"I will be introducing an amendment next week to block the President from punishing and intimidating his critics by arbitrarily revoking security clearances. Stay tuned," Warner tweeted Friday.

The amendment would be unlikely to pass but is expected to draw heavy Democratic support as they call attention to the controversy surrounding Trump's revoking of Brennan's clearance, a move which was announced Wednesday.

"I have a unique constitutional responsibility to protect the nation's classified information, including by controlling access to it. Today, in fulfilling that responsibility, I have decided to revoke the security clearance of John Brennan, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency," Trump said in a statement dictated in the White House briefing room by his press secretary Sarah Sanders. "Mr. Brennan's lying and recent conduct characterized by increasingly frenzied commentary is wholly inconsistent with access to the nation's most closely held secrets."

Brennan is the first former national security official to see his security clearance revoked since the White House announced last month that Trump was considering taking that action against several of his most vocal critics in the national security world.
__label__politics (CNN) In a New York Times op-ed — headlined "Trump Is Being Manipulated by Putin. What Should We Do?" — Texas Republican Rep. Will Hurd writes of this week's summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin:

"The president's failure to defend the United States intelligence community's unanimous conclusions of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and condemn Russian covert counterinfluence campaigns and his standing idle on the world stage while a Russian dictator spouted lies confused many but should concern all Americans. By playing into Vladimir Putin's hands, the leader of the free world actively participated in a Russian disinformation campaign that legitimized Russian denial and weakened the credibility of the United States to both our friends and foes abroad."

That's a wow. Even Republicans with a long record of criticism directed at Trump — which is a near-total overlay with members who are retiring — haven't gone as far as Hurd does here, suggesting that Trump is being worked as an asset to Russia. The American president. Being actively manipulated by a foreign government with something short of altruistic goals.

Hurd's op-ed is all the more chilling because before he came to Congress in 2014, he was a CIA operative from 2002 to 2009. This isn't some random House member spouting off to get some attention and distance himself from Trump in a swing district. This is a guy who knows of what he speaks. And he is now convinced of what was totally unthinkable even a year ago. (Worth noting: Hurd is in a very swing-y district; Hillary Clinton won it by 4 points by 2016 and he is a major target for Democrats this fall.)

Writes Hurd: "Over the course of my career as an undercover officer in the C.I.A., I saw Russian intelligence manipulate many people. I never thought I would see the day when an American president would be one of them."

__label__politics (CNN) Bob Woodward's new book -- "Fear: Trump in the White House" -- exploded onto the political scene on Tuesday morning. It included anecdotes like: President Donald Trump's aides purposely keeping information from him in order to protect the country; a failed mock-interview in preparation for a potential sit-down with special counsel Robert Mueller over Russia; and Trump lashing out at aides, most notably Jeff Sessions, referring to his attorney general as "mentally retarded."

All of this is salacious. And makes for great headlines

But what's truly worrisome for President Trump and his administration is that the portrait Woodward paints of a chaotic, dysfunctional, ill-prepared White House is all strangely familiar. It's the same vision of the White House that Michael Wolff wrote way back in January in "Fire and Fury." It's the same picture that Omarosa Manigault-Newman constructed in her memoir of her year in the White House. It's the same story that White House reporters at CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and virtually every other mainstream media outlet has told of the Trump White House.

Sure, Omarosa could be a disgruntled former aide trying to make money while exacting revenge on her enemies. Sure, Michael Wolff could have been misled by a few sources with scores to settle with Trump. Sure, reporters could get a detail or two wrong. Sure, Woodward could have cast a scene or two in ways that are less than favorable to Trump.

But how could all -- and I mean all -- of the reporting on this White House reach a striking similar conclusion? The portraits of Trump drawn by Wolff, Omarosa and Woodward are all eerily similar to one another -- a man hopelessly out of his depth in the job, but entirely incapable of understanding how desperately out of depth he actually is. A man motivated almost entirely by personal grievance. A man willing to humiliate people who work for him, to play staffers against one another, to scapegoat underlings to keep blame off of himself. Someone who has so much self-belief that he rarely adequately prepares for situations involving international diplomacy and national security. Top aides who view that their jobs are primarily keeping Trump from causing serious harm, and grousing every step of the way about the man.
__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump has made his displeasure with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, special counsel Robert Mueller and the ongoing investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election he is leading crystal clear over the past year. But he took that critique to new heights on Wednesday morning, suggesting that Sessions needed to step in and end the investigation .

"This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further," Trump tweeted. "Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!"

"Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now."

That seems like a pretty clear directive, no?

While there may be some debate over whether the President tweeting that Sessions should stop the investigation is different than him directly telling the attorney general to do so, we shouldn't get too caught up in the semantics here.

What happened on Wednesday morning is this: The President of the United States asked the top law enforcement official in the country to end an investigation into a) Russia's active-measures campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton and b) the possibility that a member (or members) of the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians to aid that end goal.

This is a bridge further than Trump has been willing to go in the past. Sure, he has run down Sessions relentlessly ever since the former Alabama senator decided to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. (Side note: Sessions' recusal means that, technically, he can't end the probe as Trump wants. That duty would fall to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who Trump has also maligned via social media.)

Trump's lawyers immediately sought to walk the tweet back. Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Dana Bash that Trump was "was expressing his opinion on his favorite medium, Twitter, for asserting his First Amendment rights" and said the tweet wasn't a demand.

"We have been saying for months that it is time to bring this inquiry to an end," Giuliani said in a statement to CNN. "The President has expressed the same opinion."

And, yes, the President has suggested -- in a broad sense -- that the investigation should end soon. "At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP," Trump tweeted in May . "They have found no Collussion [sic] with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren't looking at the corruption."

But what he has never done before is specifically direct Sessions to end the investigation. Which is a big deal. And provokes a simple question: Why now?

Trump himself provided a semblance of an answer to that question moments after he tweeted out his call for Sessions to bring the special counsel probe to an end. Ten minutes after the Sessions tweet, Trump sent this one

"Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn't government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax!"

Manafort, who served as Trump campaign chairman and de facto campaign manager from the spring until the late summer of 2016, is currently in the midst of a trial in which he faces numerous charges of financial improprieties related to his work for the pro-Russia Ukrainian government. The charges against Manafort stem directly from the Mueller probe and are regarded as the leading edge of the former FBI director's investigation -- which is expected to reach its conclusion sometime this fall.

Later, Trump added : "Looking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and "Public Enemy Number One," or Paul Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?"

And then there's this: Last week we learned -- thanks to CNN reporting! -- that former Trump personal fixer Michael Cohen says he is willing to tell Mueller that Trump had advance knowledge of a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between top Trump campaign officials and a group of Russians. Trump has repeatedly denied he knew about the meeting, which came about after the Russians -- through an intermediary named Rob Goldstone -- promised dirt on Clinton to Donald Trump Jr. (Speaking of Don Jr., he has testified to Congress under oath that he never told his father about the meeting before it happened.)

Those developments come on top of the fact that five people have already pleaded guilty to a variety of crimes in relation to the Mueller probe, and two high-profile former Trump staffers -- former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates -- are cooperating with Mueller. Cohen, who could well face criminal charges on unrelated matters in connection with an ongoing investigation by the Southern District of New York, is also seen as a potential cooperating witness.

In short: It's getting a little hot in here for Trump.

Talk to any of the people Trump confides in and they will all tell you that he believes wholeheartedly that he has done nothing wrong in connection with Russia and that the investigation is truly a witch hunt. But as Mueller creeps ever closer to Trump's innermost circle -- and Cohen as well as longtime Trump organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg are as "inner" as you get -- the pressure grows. And don't forget that we know Mueller's team is looking not only into Russian efforts in the 2016 election but also possible obstruction of the investigation as it relates to the removal of Flynn and former FBI Director James Comey in 2017.

Trump's lawyers have said he would be potentially willing to talk to Mueller about collusion -- NO COLLUSION! -- but that obstruction would be off the table for fear that Mueller would be leading the President into a perjury trap. Taking obstruction off the table in light of Trump's tweet Wednesday telling Sessions to end the investigation is -- how to say it? -- interesting.

It's hard to separate signal from noise when it comes to Trump's reactions to the Mueller probe. But the tweet this morning is an escalation from what we've seen from this President before. And we should all be paying very close attention to what happens next.
__label__world (CNN) Here's a look at Buddhism, the major religion of many countries in Asia.

Beliefs/Practices:

Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha) grew up in a wealthy family. He decided to follow a path of self-denial, but did not find truth until he sat down under a tree, now known as the Bo tree. There he was "enlightened" and obtained the knowledge he had been looking for.

According to legend, Buddha sat under the Bo tree for 49 days and was tempted by demons. He discovered four noble truths and the Eightfold Path to Nirvana, or ultimate bliss.

The Four Noble Truths of Buddhism: 1) existence is suffering, 2) the cause of suffering is craving and attachment, 3) suffering ceases at some point and turns to Nirvana (liberation or total bliss) and 4) there is a path to Nirvana which is made up of eight steps, sometimes called the Eightfold Path.

The Eightfold Path to Nirvana is to be "right" in all these areas: concentration, views, speech, resolve, action, livelihood, effort, and mindfulness.

__label__politics (CNN) The Manhattan District Attorney's Office is considering pursuing criminal charges against the Trump Organization and two senior company executives in connection to Michael Cohen's payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, the New York Times reported Thursday, citing two officials with knowledge of the matter.

According to the Times, a state investigation would focus on how the Trump Organization accounted for its reimbursement to Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer, for the $130,000 he paid to Daniels, who said she had an affair with President Donald Trump. Trump has denied the affair.

When he pleaded guilty Tuesday in Manhattan federal court to eight criminal counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud and bank fraud, Cohen admitted he paid Daniels the hush money during the 2016 campaign. Cohen was speaking as he accepted a plea deal that includes jail time.

The officials who spoke to the Times said the DA's office has not yet made a decision on whether to proceed and the review is only in the earliest stages.

The Times reports the Trump Organization recorded the reimbursement to Cohen as a legal expense, but federal prosecutors said Cohen did no legal work in connection with the matter. The payments were for fake legal invoices in connection with a nonexistent retainer agreement, according to the report.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump dismissed on Wednesday the newly-released composite sketch of a man who adult film star Stormy Daniels says threatened her over her alleged affair with Trump more than a decade ago.

"A sketch years later about a nonexistent man," he tweeted. "A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!" Trump's tweet quotes another Twitter user that includes a photo of a man who is purportedly Daniels' ex-partner who the user suggests resembles the figure in the sketch.

A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)! https://t.co/9Is7mHBFda — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 18, 2018

The tweet marks the first time Trump has commented about the matter on Twitter, though he didn't explicitly refer to Daniels. He broke his months-long silence about her allegations earlier this month when he told reporters on Air Force One he didn't know about a $130,000 payment made by his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to the adult film actress shortly before the 2016 election.

Soon after the President's response to the sketch Wednesday morning, Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, suggested new claims, like defamation, could be pursued.

"In my experience, there is nothing better in litigation than having a completely unhinged, undisciplined opponent who is prone to shooting himself in the foot. Always leads to BIGLY problems...like new claims (i.e. defamation). LOL," he tweeted.

(CNN) On Wednesday morning, Donald Trump once again took to Twitter and blasted out a direct demand to Attorney General Jeff Sessions to "stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now." Never mind that Sessions has recused himself from the investigation: The tweet is a clear threat aimed at special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation, and there is little doubt that he is saving it to the Twitter folder in his obstruction of justice file.

It is no surprise that all Washington is up in arms, justifiably, at the significance of this tweet and the demand on the attorney general. Despite Rudy Giuliani's claim, "If you are going to obstruct justice, you do it quietly," his client doesn't appear to be following the traditional playbook.

But Donald Trump's tweet is not what anyone outside the beltway or elite communities on the coasts are talking about. Russia and the investigation doesn't even register at this point on voters' radar (pollsters on either side of the aisle will confirm this).

No, Democrats thinking about what to talk about at town hall meetings during this August recess can leave the obstruction case in the hands of Mueller and focus on something much more jarring: the stunning disconnect from the everyday lives of the American people that Trump loudly exhibited at Tuesday's Florida rally.

In an effort to throw some red, anti-immigration meat at his right wing base, Trump suggested defending the Real ID law that requires Americans to present identification to receive a ballot. There is a reason this law is controversial, given the overwhelming negative effect on minority communities . Additionally, only about 50% of the American public bothers to vote, and such a law would make it more difficult.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The way Andrew Miller's attorneys and associates tell it, he's just a regular guy with nothing relevant to share with special counsel Robert Mueller.

Miller has worked on and off for Republican political operative Roger Stone for a decade. More recently, he had a gig as a marijuana farmer in California -- a business he conducted legally, according to his lawyers. These days, he works as a house painter in Missouri. In the summer of 2016, Miller's mind was on his upcoming wedding, not the presidential campaign, friends said. According to his lawyers, Miller doesn't know anything about Russian collusion or interference in the 2016 election.

It's a common refrain among Stone's friends and former aides, roughly a half dozen of whom have been summoned to talk to Mueller's investigators or a grand jury as Mueller's team circles Stone.

Stone, President Donald Trump's longtime political adviser, claims his associates are being harassed. One former Stone aide, Sam Nunberg, went on a frantic cable news blitz in the early spring insisting he'd defy his subpoena from Mueller. Another longtime friend of Stone's, Michael Caputo, compared his interview with special counsel investigators to a "proctology appointment with a very large-handed doctor."

But one by one, Stone's friends and former aides have dutifully lawyered up, trekked in and offered their testimony -- except for Miller.

A staunch Libertarian, 34-year-old Miller has refused to testify before the grand jury. Instead, he is putting up a constitutional fight challenging Mueller's authority to oversee the Russia probe. He's getting an assist from Caputo's legal defense fund, which is paying for one of Miller's lawyers, and the conservative National Legal and Policy Center, which is footing the bill for another of Miller's attorneys. A federal judge has held him in contempt of court for his resistance, positioning him to be jailed if he loses his court cases and still doesn't comply.

Miller's legal crusade is set to be the first time that higher federal courts can weigh in on Mueller's actions as special counsel. If Miller loses his court challenge, then Mueller could have a newer and stronger legal backing behind his work.

"Andrew is just being brave," said Alicia Dearn, one of Miller's attorneys. "This is really a matter of principle. This isn't a matter of him having anything to hide or even wanting to frustrate the special counsel's office."

Dearn said that if Miller ultimately loses his court challenge, he will testify rather than go to jail.

In a statement to CNN, Stone described his former aide as a "pugnacious bantam rooster" who is both blunt and genuine in his commitment to personal freedoms.

"He's a good father, a devoted husband and a loyal friend," Stone said. "The efforts to squeeze him to bear false witness against me are despicable."

A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment.

Miller first got to know Stone through his stepmother, who was Stone's former personal assistant. In the decade since, he has worked as Stone's driver, traveling aide and tech guy. He has tended to the fan mail, spam and media requests that flooded the inbox of the StoneZone, the official website for Stone's clips, quips and columns.

When Kristin Davis -- also known as the 'Manhattan Madam' for running a high-end prostitution ring -- ran for governor of New York in 2010, Stone worked as her campaign strategist and Miller as her campaign manager.

In 2016 -- soon after his wedding -- Miller accompanied Stone to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland to ferry him around and keep track of his appointments.

The super PAC run by Stone paid $9,000 to A Miller Research -- a company run by Miller -- during the 2016 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Miller's attorney has said it was compensation for scheduling appointments and media appearances for Stone. Stone has said it was for IT work. Another political group affiliated with Stone paid Miller's firm $5,000 for "consulting," according to FEC reports.

Dearn said she isn't sure what Mueller is looking for when it comes to Stone, but she's quite certain her client isn't in possession of it.

"I don't think that he is the linchpin for whatever it is they're seeking on Roger Stone," Dearn said.

Miller's case is complicated by the fact that he initially cooperated with the special counsel's investigation. When FBI agents first approached him in May, he spoke with them at his home in St. Louis for two hours without an attorney. At the end of the interview, they handed him grand jury subpoenas for testimony and documents, according to a recent court filing he made.

Afterward, he reached out to Dearn.

The two first met while working for the 2012 Libertarian presidential campaign of former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, for which she was general counsel and he was a traveling aide.

Dearn put the kibosh on Miller's plan to meet with investigators a few days later for an informal interview.

After a protracted back and forth between Dearn and Mueller's team, Miller handed over a tranche of documents. In turn, the government had agreed to limit its search to certain terms such as Stone, WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, Guccifer 2.0, DCLeaks and the Democratic National Committee, according to court filings and interview with attorneys.

Dearn was adamant that Miller not be forced to testify to the grand jury about one topic in specific: Stone. She asked that her client be granted immunity, "otherwise he's going to have to take the Fifth Amendment," she said in a court hearing in June.

Aaron Zelinsky, one of Mueller's prosecutors, noted Miller's lawyer was making two seemingly contradictory arguments: "On the one hand, that the witness knows nothing, has nothing to hide, and has participated in no illegal activity. On the other hand, that there is a Fifth Amendment concern there."

In the hearing, Dearn said she was concerned Miller would be asked about his finances and transactions related to political action committees he worked on with Stone.

Dearn said in an interview that she was just being "carefully paranoid" and protecting her client from accidentally committing perjury if he testifies and contradicts something he told investigators back in May without a lawyer present.

Miller "had absolutely no communication with anybody from Russia or with Guccifer or WikiLeaks," Dearn said in an interview.

By process of elimination, the only thing she believes her client could get caught up on are questions about his financial entanglements with Stone and his super PAC.

Shan Wu, a CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney who, for a period, defended former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates in the Russia probe, can see it both ways.

"It's possible he really does know something and they're trying to protect him," by preventing Miller from testifying, Wu said.

Or perhaps Miller really is just a regular guy who knows nothing of interest and that's what makes him the ideal witness to mount this challenge.

"They're looking for any vehicle to challenge Mueller," Wu said of outside groups like the National Legal and Policy Center. "You can pitch this guy as a regular American working stiff who's being caught up in this."

That's exactly how Dearn has cast her client, as a "normal blue-collar kind of guy" who was born and raised in Missouri by a family of liberal union workers.

Miller -- a slight man with a hipster-esque style that Stone described as "anti-fashion" -- recently decided to give up pot farming and his gig as a volunteer firefighter in California. In May, he moved his family back to his hometown of St. Louis and started painting houses. He wanted his 4-year-old daughter to grow up closer to family and with more readily available playmates than woodsy Lakehead, California, had to offer, friends said.

He hasn't publicized his plight on television and mainly finds media attention stressful, Dearn said.

"I think that he mostly, despite all of this litigation that's going on, he mostly wants peace and quiet," she added.

But challenging Mueller's authority leaves little room for that.

A DC District Court judge denied Miller's request to quash his grand jury subpoena. Miller had alleged that Mueller doesn't have the authority to oversee the Russia probe. But Chief Judge Beryl Howell emphatically wrote that Mueller did and Miller needed to speak to the grand jury. Howell became one of four federal judges who have upheld Mueller's appointment and constitutional authority amid court challenges.

After Miller skipped out on his scheduled grand jury appearance, he was held in contempt of court earlier this month. His lawyers have filed an appeal and are angling to take their case to the Supreme Court. The appeal isn't slated to be heard in court until after October 9, raising the question of whether Mueller would move forward in his grand jury investigation sooner without Miller.

In recent days, the indicted Russian company Concord Management and Consulting has tried to jump on board Miller's appeal, while calling him a "recalcitrant witness" in Mueller's probe. Miller, in one recent court filing, insists he's been cooperative.

"This is the best client, I would think, to bring this issue -- one who's not being obstructive but who is being cooperative," said Paul Kamenar, Miller's attorney through the National Legal and Policy Center. "Even if we were to lose, we would have done a public service by dispelling any doubts about whether or not special counsels like Mueller are unconstitutional."
__label__politics Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) Former US President Barack Obama mounted a passionate defense of democracy and warned against the rise of "strongman politics," in a speech in South Africa a day after his successor, Donald Trump, was heavily criticized for a humiliating news conference with Vladimir Putin.

In an address Tuesday in honor of the late Nelson Mandela ahead of the 100th anniversary of his birth, Obama criticized populist movements toward authoritarianism around the world and ridiculed the "utter loss of shame among political leaders" who lie.

Obama has made an art of criticizing the current President's values without explicitly naming Trump , peppering his speech Tuesday with warnings against some of Trump's key policies, including protectionism, climate change denial and closed borders.

"The politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment began to appear. And that kind of politics is now on the move. It's on the move at a pace that would have seemed unimaginable just a few years ago," he told the crowd of around 15,000 people in Johannesburg.

"I am not being alarmist, I'm simply stating the facts. Look around — strongman politics are ascendant, suddenly, whereby elections and some pretense of democracy are maintained, the form of it, where those in powers seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning."

'People just make stuff up'

Obama's remarks come a day after Trump's news conference in Helsinki , Finland, in which the US leader sided with Putin over his own country's intelligence agencies on whether Russia interfered in the 2016 US election.

Trump had been expected by some observers to confront Putin over the issue after the US Department of Justice indicted 12 Russians, accused of hacking the Democrat's emails and computer networks to target Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

The President flip-flopped on his stance on the matter, having said last year he believed Russia was behind the interference, but back-pedaling Monday to claim he believed Putin's account that Russia was not involved.

Obama mocked the way politicians lie and reminded his audience of the importance of facts.

"You have to believe in facts. Without facts there's no basis for cooperation. If I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant, it's going to be hard for us to cooperate," he said.

"I can't find common ground if somebody says that climate change just isn't happening, when almost all the world's scientists tell us it is. I don't know where to start talking to you about this. If you say it's an elaborate hoax, where do we start?"

Attendees of Obama's speech at the Wanderers Cricket Stadium in Johannesburg.

He added that politics today often rejected the concept of objective truth.

"People just make stuff up. They just make stuff up. We see it in the growth of state sponsored propaganda. We see it in internet fabrications. We see it in the blurring of lines between news and entertainment. We see the utter loss of shame among political leaders where they're caught in a lie and they just double down and they lie some more. It used to be that if you caught them lying, they'd be like, oh man -- now they just keep on lying," he said, to laughter in the crowd.

'Head-spinning and disturbing headlines'

Obama had opened his speech reflecting on the recent chaos of the world that gave him the opportunity to seek perspective.

"But in the strange and uncertain times that we are in -- and they are strange, and they are uncertain, with each day's news cycles bringing more head-spinning and disturbing headlines -- I thought maybe it would be useful to step back for a moment and try to get some perspective, so I hope you'll indulge me," he said.

Barack Obama, right, and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

He warned that the press was under attack, that censorship and state control of media is on the rise and that social media was being used to promote hate, propaganda and conspiracy theories.

"So, on Madiba's 100 birthday, we now stand at a crossroads," he said, using a clan name of affection for Mandela.

He said that there was a choice between two visions of humanity's future that the world must choose between.

"How should we respond? Should we see that wave of hope that we felt with Madiba's release from prison? From the Berlin Wall coming down? Should we see that hope that we had as naïve and misguided?" he asked.

"Let me tell you what I believe. I believe in Nelson Mandela's vision, I believe in a vision shared by Gandhi and King, and Abraham Lincoln, I believe in a vision of equality and justice and freedom and multi-racial democracy built on the premise that all people are created equal and are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights."

Obama's speech, the 16th annual Nelson Mandela Lecture, is one of his highest-profile appearances and his first return to Africa since he left office in 2017.

His lecture, titled "Renewing the Mandela legacy and promoting active citizenship in a changing world," tracked the transformation of the world, particularly in terms of race relations and human rights, over the past 100 years.

"It is a plain fact that racial discrimination still exists in both the United States and South Africa," he said.

Obama's speech followed remarks by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and Mandela's widow, Graça Machel, formerly a freedom fighter and minister in Mozambique's government.

Machel drew several parallels between Mandela and Obama, portraying them both as modest men as "symbols of victory over adversity."

"From the humblest of beginnings, they are representatives of the masses and reached to the pinnacle of power and influence. But in doing so they were able to elevate the rights and ambitions of the disenfranchised and the weak. Of young and old, of both men and women, of black and white," she said of both leaders.

Ramaphosa said South Africans celebrated Obama because he shared similar leadership qualities as Mandela and had the same ability to inspire hope and action.

Imprisoned for nearly three decades for his fight against state-sanctioned racial segregation, he was freed in 1990 and quickly set about working to unite the nation through forgiveness and reconciliation, becoming South Africa's first black president. Obama, who became the US' first black president in 2009, has referred to Mandela as a mentor.

According to the group that funds the portraits, the mug of the Russian leader was placed in Trump's would-be spot by an unknown prankster Thursday morning. It was discovered during a tour.

This might not have happened but for one problem: The state hasn't raised the $10,000 needed for a Trump portrait, leaving an empty spot on the third-floor rotunda in Denver.

DC District Judge Emmet Sullivan then blocked the administration from deporting the two plaintiffs while they are fighting for their right to stay in the US -- excoriating the administration and threatening to hold Attorney General Jeff Sessions in contempt.

The government raced to comply with the court's order, and by Thursday evening the immigrants had arrived back in Texas after being turned around on the ground in El Salvador.

Sullivan agreed with the American Civil Liberties Union that the immigrants they are representing in a federal lawsuit should not be deported while their cases are pending.

The emergency hearing in the case turned dramatic when attorneys discovered partway through the hearing that two of their clients were on a plane to El Salvador.

__label__politics (CNN) A former Nazi labor camp guard who has been living in the United States for decades has finally been deported to Germany after years of diplomatic wrangling, the White House announced on Tuesday.

Jakiw Palij, who worked as a guard at the Trawniki Labor Camp, in what was then German-occupied Poland, had been living out his post-war years in Queens, New York City.

Palij, 95, was born in what was then-Poland and now Ukraine, and immigrated to the US in 1949, becoming a citizen in 1957. The former Nazi guard lied to US immigration officials about his role in World War II, saying he worked on a farm and in a factory, the White House said in a statement.

In 2001, Palij admitted to US Department of Justice officials that he had in fact trained and worked at the Trawniki Labor Camp in 1943. On November 3, 1943, around 6,000 Jewish prisoners at the camp were shot to death in one of the single largest massacres of the Holocaust, according to the White House statement.

"By serving as an armed guard at the Trawniki Labor Camp and preventing the escape of Jewish prisoners during his Nazi service, Palij played an indispensable role in ensuring that the Trawniki Jewish victims met their horrific fate at the hands of the Nazis," the White House added.

The attack was carried out by the girl's 14-year-old stepbrother and two of his friends "in presence and at the instance of her stepmother" according to police, who said the violence was due to a family dispute.

The girl's father's remarriage had led to a feud between with his first and second wives, police said.

__label__politics (CNN) The governor's race in Florida not only says a lot about where the Democratic and Republican parties are today but could also tell us where they are headed in the future.

Republican Ron DeSantis is the Donald Trump of the 2018 Florida gubernatorial campaign. He was backed by Trump in the primary, and the endorsement helped him shoot up in the polls.

Democrat Andrew Gillum represents the ascendent wing of the Democratic Party. He's a young, black progressive in a party that is becoming more liberal, younger and more diverse . In other words, Gillum is a picture of what the Democratic presidential nominee might be like in 2020.

A win by Gillum over DeSantis would be a clear indicator that Democrats would be in a strong position in Florida headed into 2020 after Hillary Clinton lost the state to Trump in 2016.

The state hasn't elected a Democratic governor since 1994. Democrats have also struggled in presidential elections since that point. Yes, they won the state a few times. Florida, though, never voted more Democratic than the nation as a whole. That is, the state continued to have a red tint to it.

The Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania called the damage "grotesque" and asked investigators "to treat this incident with maximum severity with maximum responsibility."

It is "not just an attack on Elie Wiesel's memory, but on all the victims of the Holocaust," said the statement from institute CEO Alexandru Florian.

The childhood home of Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel was vandalized Friday.

The Romanian Foreign Affairs Ministry said it "firmly condemns any anti-Semitic gestures and any behaviour or expression that promotes intolerance and xenophobia."

The vandalism, which happened Friday at the home in Sighetu Marmatiei, near Romania's northern border with Ukraine, is the subject of a police investigation. There are surveillance cameras in the area, and police have composed a list of suspects, according to a statement from the local county council.

__label__world New Delhi, India (CNN) Disadvantaged children and adults living in care homes in the Indian state of Bihar were subjected to sustained sexual, mental and physical abuse, according to a newly released report that has caused national outcry and demands for reform.

Researchers from Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) audited 110 institutions over six months and found 15 government-run homes where immediate action was needed due to "appalling" allegations of abuse, though it found that violence was present in almost all of them.

The report was submitted to the Bihar government in April but made public Thursday after an order by the Supreme Court which weighed in on the case after a public outcry over alleged incompetence by the state authority.

The report says some of the worst claims emerged from a girl's home in Muzaffarpur, a city just 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Bihar's capital, Patna, where children said they were subjected to sexual violence by male staff on a regular basis. "Male staff reportedly entered their rooms at odd hours and hit them on their privates," the report said.

"The girls had no access to any sort of open space and were literally locked up in their wards except for when they went to the dining hall to take their meals. Vocational trainings and recreation were unheard of," reads the report.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Going into this term, liberals had hoped that Anthony Kennedy, the 81-year-old conservative justice who has sided with the left on several historic Supreme Court decisions, would help hold off the rightward trend of the court.

That didn't happen.

Kennedy, always the subject of intense retirement rumors -- who finally announced his decision to leave the court Wednesday afternoon -- shuffled right and never sided with liberals in the major 5-4 cases that split down familiar ideological lines.

This term, Kennedy voted with his conservative colleagues in cases concerning issues such as the travel ban, religious liberty, voting rights, arbitration agreements, corporate liability and public sector unions.

"Although there were 19 5-4 decisions, none of those saw Justice Anthony Kennedy siding with the four more progressive justices -- as he has done so often in high-profile cases in recent years, such as the gay marriage ruling in 2015," said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

But conservatives haven't forgotten that Kennedy cleared the way for same-sex marriage in 2015,and he voted with the liberals in 2016 in an abortion case and one concerning affirmative action.

This term, there were two particularly divisive cases where all eyes were on the man who has so often provided the swing vote.

One concerned a baker who refused to make a cake to celebrate a couple's wedding out of a religious objection to same sex marriage. The case -- Masterpiece Cakeshop -- brought two strands of Kennedy's jurisprudence together: LGBT rights and religious liberty.

LGBT-rights groups hoped he'd slam the door shut on the baker in a ruling that would impact businesses throughout the country. Instead, he wrote for a 7-2 court in favor of the baker. The holding was carefully tailored to the case at hand but will have national impact nonetheless.

But a few days later the court had the opportunity to take up a similar case of a florist for next term. The court did not have the appetite to step in again to rule more broadly. It vacated the opinion that went against the florist and sent the case back down to a lower court in light of the Masterpiece ruling.

In two other cases concerning partisan gerrymandering, the court was asked to develop a legal test to determine when states go too far in drawing lines for partisan gain. While some conservatives argue such issues should be left to the political branches, Kennedy held open the door to legal challenges back in 2004.

Would this be the year for Kennedy to articulate a standard rooted in equal protection or free speech? Critics of extreme partisan gerrymandering in both parties were let down when the court dodged the big question in both cases. And again, faced with the opportunity to take up a similar challenge next term in a North Carolina case, the justices sent the issue back down to the lower courts.

And even though Kennedy didn't side with them very much this term on the contentious cases, liberal justices are undoubtedly relieved that he decided to stay on the bench. For now.

Last year, in fact, an audience member asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg an odd question during an appearance: Who should eat more kale in Washington?

She didn't miss a beat: Anthony Kennedy.

This story was updated following Kennedy's decision to retire.
__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump, amid the worst week of his presidency, sat down for a friendly interview with "Fox and Friends" host Ainsley Earhardt to make his case. As so often happens when Trump is backed into a corner, he lashed out at, well, everyone.

I went through the transcript of the interview Fox released this morning. Trump's quotes -- and my thoughts on them -- are below.

1. "And I guess you could say that our numbers in winning whether it's for the Senate, or for Congress, or for governor has been very good."

And away we go! To be clear: Every traditional predictor of election outcomes suggest Republicans will take a battering in the House and at the governors level. The Senate, because the playing field is heavily tilted toward Republicans, could be more favorable to Trump's side.

2. "I've always had controversy in my life and I've always succeeded. I've always won. I've always won."

Two notes here: a) he's right -- his entire life has been controversial and b) he only sees things through the lens of winning or losing. There is no other measure of success or failure. If you win, you were right.

3. "They like to cover nonsense."

Trump is talking about the media here, insisting the press doesn't cover the good economic news of his administration. ( Not true !) Earhardt's response to that attack on the media -- of which she is, theoretically, a part? "Right." Good times.

4. "Well I don't know if he was a fixer. I don't know where that term came from."

Well, Michael Cohen, at the direction of Trump, set up a shell company and negotiated payoffs to two women -- Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal -- who alleged they had affairs with Trump. And remember that the way Cohen and Trump met was Cohen took Trump's side in a dispute with tenants in one of his buildings. You could say Cohen has " fixed " more than one problem for Trump.

5. "But he was somebody that was probably with me for about 10 years and I would see him sometimes."

This is a dramatic underplaying of Cohen's closeness to Trump over that decade, according to what we know about the two men's relationship. Anytime Trump had a problem that needed fixing -- and that happened fairly frequently -- he turned to Cohen to fix it. Cohen was involved therefore in some of the most delicate situations in Trump's world -- including paying hush money to women making allegations about affairs.

6. "He made the deal. He made the deals."

This is Trump's response to Earhardt asking him whether he directed Cohen to make the payments to Daniels and McDougal. Which, of course, isn't a denial at all. The issue is not who "made the deals," but who directed the deals to be made.

7. "Those two counts aren't even a crime. They weren't campaign finance."

What Trump doesn't know about campaign finance law is, um, a whole lot. He seems to believe that because he didn't give money to Cohen from the 2016 campaign account that it was totally fine to dole out tens of thousands of dollars to silence women making allegations about a candidate for president. Which it isn't. What Trump did is effectively make a campaign loan to Cohen to handle a problem for him. He never disclosed that loan. And we know for a fact that Cohen has testified that Trump "directed" and "coordinated" him to make the payments for the express purpose of influencing the election.

8. "Later on I knew. Later on."

Trump's "later on" response about when he found out about the payments that Cohen made to Daniels and McDougal simply doesn't jibe with what he has said in the past. In April, on Air Force One, Trump had this exchange with a reporter:

Reporter: "Did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?"

Trump: "No."

Reporter: "Then why did Michael Cohen make [the payment], if there was no truth to her allegations?"

Trump: "You'll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael's my attorney, and you'll have to ask Michael."

Reporter: "Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?"

Trump: "No I don't know.

So......

What's remarkable is Earhardt's follow-up to this clear lie by the President of the United States is "Why is Cohen doing this?" Really knocking it out of the park.

9. "If you look at President Obama, he had a massive campaign violation but he had a different attorney general and they viewed it a lot differently."

Apples and oranges. Or, more accurately, apples and kumquats. Like, not even in the same universe.

It is true that Obama's campaign was fined a hefty $375,000 by the FEC in 2013 for failure to file 48-hour contribution reports -- donations made within the final weeks of a campaign -- that totaled $1.3 million. The oversight was discovered in an audit of the Obama campaign.

Compare that fine to what is alleged here: A candidate for president directed the end-run of campaign finance laws in hopes of suppressing allegations made by women about romantic dalliances. He did so, according to Cohen, with the express purpose of influencing the election.

Yes, so, no.

10. "But what Michael Cohen pled to weren't even campaign related. They weren't crimes."

Again, Trump simply doesn't understand -- or is choosing not to understand -- campaign finance laws. Simply because the money he paid to Cohen wasn't from the campaign's coffers doesn't mean it wasn't a crime. Cohen literally pleaded guilty to two campaign finance crimes on Tuesday. Like, does Trump not think the Southern District of New York is aware of what the laws surrounding campaign finance are? [Narrator voice: They are.]

11. "And they put the two counts of campaign violations in there but a lot of lawyers on television and also lawyers that I have say, they're -- they're not even crimes."

Name one. Seriously.

12. "For 30, 40 years I've been watching flippers. Everything's wonderful and then they get 10 years in jail and they -- they flip on whoever the next highest one is, or as high as you can go."

"According to a 1981 FBI memo , Trump offered to 'fully cooperate' with the bureau, proposing that FBI agents work undercover in a casino he was considering opening in Atlantic City. FBI agents even prepared an 'undercover proposal concerning the TRUMP casino' that senior agents and Trump planned to discuss, according to the document."

13. "It -- it almost ought to be outlawed. It's not fair."

14. "You know, campaign violations are considered not a big deal, frankly."

Let me say again: Donald Trump is not terribly well-versed in campaign finance laws.

15. "But if somebody defrauded a bank and he's going to get 10 years in jail or 20 years in jail but if you can say something bad about Donald Trump and you'll go down to two years or three years, which is the deal he made."

There's a big difference between Cohen (or anyone) getting a reduced sentence because they are willing to "say something bad about Donald Trump" and what Cohen did: Agreed to plead guilty to eight felony counts and testify -- under oath -- that Trump directed and coordinated an end-run of campaign finance laws. This is not Michael Cohen calling Donald Trump names and getting time cut off his prison sentence. This is Michael Cohen saying the President of the United States was complicit in a crime.

16. "I've had many friends involved in this stuff. It's called flipping and it almost ought to be illegal."

17. "I'll tell you than somebody made a better deal. Awan, the IT guy for Shultz. Congresswoman Shultz. He had all the information on Democrats. He had all the information on everybody. He went to jail holding the hands of the Justice Department and the FBI."

Trump is referring here to Imran Awan, a former staffer for Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former head of the Democratic National Committee. He pleaded guilty last month to filing a false statement on a bank loan application . Trump -- and other conspiracy-minded folks on the right -- have seized on the fact that Awan worked with Wasserman Schultz as evidence he was involved in the hack of DNC emails during the 2016 campaign. You know, the one the intelligence community has concluded was Russia's doing.

In the plea deal with Awan, the government said that there was zero evidence that Awan stole information from DNC servers or tried to abscond with the servers themselves.

18. "I mean, he was worse than anybody in my opinion. He got nothing. He's a Democrat. He got nothing."

Awan was sentenced to time served earlier this week. That amounted to one day in jail and 11 months of monitoring with an ankle bracelet. At Awan's sentencing hearing, the district judge said this -- clearly referencing Trump: "There have been numerous allegations, ... accusations lobbed at him from the highest branches of the government, all of which have been proved to be without foundation by the FBI and the Department of Justice."

19. "I put in an attorney general that never took control of the Justice Department. Jeff Sessions never took control of the Justice Department and it's a sort of an incredible thing."

Trump belittles his hand-picked attorney general, chapter 5,291

20. "Comey's his best friend."

This has become one of Trump's favorite talking points when trying to discredit the special counsel probe being run by former FBI director Robert Mueller. It's not at all clear it's true. There's no question Mueller and Comey know one another through work. There's a lot of questions about the actual closeness of their relationship

21. "He had a really nasty business transaction with me, which he never reported. I've been talking about it, he never reports it."

The "really nasty business transaction" Trump refers to here is what The New York Times reported that Trump has claimed was a dispute over fees at one of his golf clubs when the former FBI director resigned his membership in 2011. According to The Washington Post , "a spokesman for Mueller said there was no dispute when Mueller, who was FBI director at the time, left the club."

22. "I have great respect for what he's done in terms of what he's going through."

This is Trump's response to an Earhardt question on whether he is considering pardoning former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Trump's response is a little bit different -- OK, a LOT bit different -- from how White House Secretary Sarah Sanders answered the Manafort pardon question on Wednesday afternoon. "Once again, that is not something that has been up for discussion," Sanders said. Um, what?

23. "He wasn't with the campaign long."

Manafort was Trump's de facto campaign manager from April 2016 until August 2016. That period was of critical import to Trump as he went from the frontrunner for the nomination to securing it. It was also the period of time -- June 2016 to be exact -- that we know Manafort as well as Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner met with Russians to talk about the alleged dirt they claimed to have on Hillary Clinton.

24. "They surveilled my campaign, it's very simple."

The FBI surveilled Carter Page, a foreign policy aide to Trump, because they believed him to be possibility under the influence of the Russians . The surveillance warrant was approved by the FISA court and re-approved three times. This wasn't some rogue operation conducted by the so-called "deep state" within the FBI.

25. "When everybody see's what going on in the Justice Department I always put justice now with quotes. It's a very, very sad day. Jeff Sessions recused himself, which he shouldn't have done. Or he should have told me."

This is Trump's response to Earhardt asking whether he was going to fire Sessions. It doesn't exactly read like a vote of confidence.

26. "Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you wouldn't have put him in."

[Narrator voice: They don't.]

27. "You know the only reason I gave him the job. Because I felt loyalty, he was an original supporter. He was on the campaign."

A remarkable admission here from Trump -- albeit unintentional. The "only reason" he appointed Jeff Sessions to be the nation's highest ranking law enforcement official was because Sessions was loyal to him on the campaign. Only the best people!

28. "The immigration laws are horrible. We're doing an incredible job."

Back to back sentences. Unedited. No rhyme, reason or connection I can decipher.

29. "You know when you have bad laws you can do good. But you can do a lot better if you had good laws."

[scratches out a series of complex math equations on a yellow-lined notebook] Yeah, this checks out.

30. "I don't know how you can impeach somebody who's done a great job."

This is the most astounding quote in the entire Trump interview. If you are doing a self-assessed "great job" then it is impossible for you to have broken any laws? That's literally what Trump is saying here.

31. "I tell you what, if I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, I think everybody would be very poor."

Remarkable. The self-regard on display here is truly staggering. The only thing that has made the economy strengthen is Trump, according to Trump. Without him? Good luck, America.

32. "The New York Times cannot write a good story about me. They're crazed. They're like lunatics."

Let's be clear here. Trump views "true" news as news that is good for him. "Fake news" is then news that is bad for him. For all of his talk about "fake news" he is totally uninterested in the accuracy of reporting. He is entirely fixated on whether a story reads positively or negatively for him.

33. "And I'll never forget, you talk about the fake news, they said Donald Trump met [Kim Jong Un] the first day it was incredible, nobody could believe I was able to do it."

So, wait. The news is fake. But Trump cites favorably in this section the fact that the news reported on the historic summit he engineered with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. But if the news is fake, then how... [head explodes]

34. "So I give myself an A-plus."

Earhardt asked Trump what grade he would give himself. That Trump went with the highest possible grade really tells you everything you need to know about him. Seriously.

35. "The only thing ... I'm doing badly on is the press doesn't cover me fairly."

If I had to name my greatest weakness, I think I would probably say it's that I care too much about people. Or maybe that I am so smart it makes it hard to interact with people not as smart as me. Either one would work.

36. "I would say I would honestly give myself an A-plus and so would many other people."

CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Imran Awan's employer.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is in no mood to take lectures from John McCain and the weeklong national civics lesson the Arizona senator sketched with his own funeral rites.

On a day of poignant juxtaposition, McCain's flag draped coffin left his beloved home soil of Arizona for the last time Thursday after his friends eulogized a life embroidered with honor, self-sacrifice, American exceptionalism and the idea of serving a cause greater than oneself.

Leaving Washington to mourners, Trump flew west and unspooled the kind of brazen campaign trail performance -- tearing at the nation's political and cultural divides and bashing institutions such as the Justice Department -- that McCain planned his final goodbye to repudiate.

The former combat pilot's last flight ended in the gathering dusk of Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, as McCain was borne back to the capital, where he was once a ubiquitous figure, for the first time since December. Though McCain never became president, the military ceremony and sense of solemnity had the historic sense of a state occasion.

Less than an hour later, Trump, soaking in the adulation of a wildly cheering crowd, strolled on stage in Indiana to the strains of Lee Greenwood's "God Bless the USA" and opened his speech with a boast about his 2016 presidential win in the state and his economic record.

"Where the hell did she come from?" Trump asked, as his supporters booed a lone protester escorted from the arena, before bashing "dishonest, terrible" people in the media and lambasting the "old and corrupt ruling class," of which America could be "ashamed."

Chants of "lock her up, lock her up," echoed through the arena, aimed at Hillary Clinton.

The split screen moment of Trump, the showman in his element on stage, and Washington grandees gathering to mourn McCain, exemplified competing strains between traditional establishment politics and grassroots insurgencies at radical wings of each party that may define the just-stirring 2020 presidential campaign.

With that in mind, it seems fitting that in the next stage of McCain's farewell, his coffin will rest Friday in the Capitol Rotunda on the catafalque that first bore the remains of Abraham Lincoln, the President who warned his nation that "a house divided against itself cannot stand."

A feud that will not die

JUST WATCHED Biden: I'm a Democrat and I love John McCain Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden: I'm a Democrat and I love John McCain 02:30

Thursday's political theater personified the running feud that has raged between McCain and Trump even after the Arizona statesman's death from brain cancer on Saturday.

On the one side is politics McCain-style, in which a sometimes irascible temperament, relish for battle and dedication to conservatism did not preclude the late senator carving friendships across the aisle or seeking compromise on some of the most divisive issues.

By meticulously planning his funeral arrangements, including addresses by former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- but not Trump - - McCain spelled out a clear message that he believed the current administration had taken an un-American turn.

On the other hand is the raucous rejection of traditional Washington values exemplified by Trump, whose insurgent fury, fondness for conspiracy theories and contempt for convention inspired Americans who felt rejected by the very political elites now lauding McCain.

Nearly two years since Trump's shock 2016 election win, McCain's brand of politics may be sorely missed by those who idealize it. But the President has the power, a fact that raises questions whether the nostalgia for McCain is also a valediction for a fading mode of politics.

Trump did not mention McCain at his rally. But earlier, he told Bloomberg News that he didn't think he had done anything wrong in his grudging response to his foe's death.

"We had our disagreements and they were very strong disagreements. I disagreed with many of the things that I assume he believed in," Trump said.

The values that McCain revered were encapsulated in a moving eulogy by his friend and Senate sparring partner, former Vice President Joe Biden at a memorial service in Phoenix.

"It was always about basic values with John: Fairness, honesty, dignity, respect; giving hate no safe harbor; leaving no one behind; and understanding that as Americans, we're part of something much bigger than ourselves," Biden said.

A volatile week, even by Trump's standards

Most politicians are ego driven, hungry for the next headline and sometimes attack the motives of their rivals, a practice Biden decried in his speech. But most take pains to hide such traits, and a few, such as McCain, honestly reflect on their own transgressions in a way that forges bonds with the public.

But Trump makes no attempt to disguise such behavior. His quintessential political insight was to put it at the core of his campaign trail persona -- and it helped him capture the Republican Party and the presidency. His unapologetic style is one reason he refused to temper his behavior in the week of McCain's passing -- and further alienated the more conventional politicians who loved the Arizona senator.

Trump's most fervent supporters would probably not recognize qualities in the President that Biden saw in McCain. But that is exactly what made him so popular with a political base ready to embrace a scorched earth candidate.

The proof has been everywhere in a week that has been volatile even by Trump's standards and suggests the President has little time for the notion that politics is about a cause greater than the individual. Often as he boasts about ratings and his poll numbers and his 2016 election triumph, it seems that for Trump, it's all about him.

Over the last week, Trump reacted to comparisons between him and McCain by offering lukewarm tributes and only belatedly lowering the flag over the White House to half-staff.

His determination to continue to wage a quarrel with a dead man exemplified his intense sensitivity to slights and prompted critics to conclude that he fails to put the wider duties of the office of the presidency above his personal image and preoccupations.

In the same vein, Trump's relentless humiliation of Jeff Sessions is born out of an often expressed resentment that the attorney general put his loyalty to the law before his personal fealty to the President by recusing himself from the Russia investigation.

Trump also obsessed about his press coverage and complained that Google was censoring favorable stories about him. He issued a defensive statement to rebut criticism of his personal handling of the North Korea nuclear crisis. He insisted his team had done a "fantastic job" when Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico , despite new figures showing that nearly 3,000 people died in last year's disaster.

Almost every day Trump slammed the "rigged Russia witch hunt," along with the FBI and the Justice Department, pillars of the political system that McCain saw as essential parts of the foundation of US democracy.

It reflected a presidency that is becoming less and less conventional the longer it goes and often seems to revolve almost exclusively around the whims and outbursts of Trump himself. There's no chance that the focus on McCain and the politics and civic sensibilities he prized will change minds in the GOP base. Whether it will rouse other sectors of the electorate will begin to be answered in the midterm elections in November.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Washington luminaries, former presidents and the family of John McCain gathered Saturday at Washington National Cathedral to honor and remember the late senator in a grand display of pomp and unity in the nation's capital.

Amid praise for the life and legacy of McCain were frequent lamentations of Washington's current political climate. The man implicitly referenced in those criticisms, President Donald Trump, was asked not to attend at the late senator's request and instead visited one of his golf courses in Sterling, Virginia. He also tweeted on several occasions about unrelated topics, including trade negotiations with Canada.

Among the tributes -- including from former McCain rivals and Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- was an emotional remembrance from McCain's daughter Meghan that included several pointed and unmistakable references to Trump.

"We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness. The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly," McCain said in her remarks, during which she often struggled to fight back tears.

"The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great," she said at one point to sustained applause inside the cathedral.

Drawing a further contrast between her father and the current President, McCain said, "We live in an era where we knock down old American heroes for all their imperfections when no leader wants to admit to fault or failure. You were an exception and gave us an ideal to strive for."

Bush, Obama remember formal rival

Bush remembered McCain in his remarks as "above all, a man with a code," saying that "he lived by a set of public virtues that brought strength and purpose to his life and to his country."

The former President said that the late senator "was courageous" and "honest, no matter whom it offended," adding that even "presidents were not spared."

"Those in political power were not exempt. At various points throughout his long career, John confronted policies and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country. To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: We are better than this. America is better than this," Bush said.

Obama said when McCain asked him to speak at the memorial service, he felt a mixture of "sadness" and "a certain surprise." The request "captured some of John's essential qualities," including his "ability to see past differences in search of common ground," Obama said.

The former President acknowledged the contrast between himself and McCain, saying, "We were standard-bearers of different American political traditions." But Obama spoke of a deep respect for the late senator. "For all our differences, for all the times we sparred, I never tried to hide, and I think John came to understand, the longstanding admiration that I had for him."

Obama also opened up about his behind-the-scenes relationship McCain and the bond they shared across party lines.

"We didn't advertise it, but every so often over the course of my presidency, John would come over to the White House and we would just sit and talk in the Oval Office, just the two of us," Obama said, saying they discussed policy, family and politics.

"Our disagreements didn't go away during these private conversations," he said. "But we enjoyed the time we shared away from the bright lights." Obama added, "When all was said and done, we were on the same team."

Display of unity

The remarks from former Democratic and Republican presidents who were once rivals to McCain sent a message of unity and bipartisanship at a time when Washington is deeply divided.

Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said at the service that "the world will be lonelier without John McCain," but that, "even in his parting, John has bestowed on us a much-needed moment of unity."

Former Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-Independent, recalled his friendship with McCain and spoke at length about how McCain had wanted to name him as a running mate during his 2008 presidential campaign.

Lieberman recalled questioning whether it could work. "When he first talked to me about it, I said, 'You know John, I'm really honored, but I don't see how you can do it,'" he said, remembering a conversation he had with McCain.

He said that the late senator responded with some impatience, saying: "That's the point Joe ... You're a Democrat, I'm a Republican, we could give our country the bipartisan leadership it needs for a change."

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was McCain's running mate in the 2008 presidential election was not invited to any of the memorial services.

Other Washington leaders and longtime friends of McCain attended the service.

Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden, who delivered an emotional eulogy for McCain at a memorial service in Arizona on Thursday, served as a pallbearer on Saturday.

Actor Warren Beatty, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and former chief of staff to McCain Mark Salter also served as pallbearers, among others.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close friend of McCain's, and McCain's children Jimmy and Sidney McCain all took part in readings during the ceremony.

The President's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner both attended the ceremony. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, tweeted later in the afternoon that he and his son attended the ceremony, which he described as a "beautiful service." Giuliani called McCain "a generous friend as well as a hero and patriot."

Former Democratic President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were also present.

In a poignant moment, as McCain's casket departed the cathedral, Roberta McCain, the late senator's 106-year-old mother, sat alone in a wheelchair at the top of the stairs, looking down and wiping away tears. Eventually, a uniformed military officer joined her and brought her back inside the cathedral when the hearse left.

The service followed a public procession that brought McCain's body from the US Capitol to the cathedral. The motorcade stopped along the way at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where Cindy McCain, the late senator's wife, laid a wreath in memory of those who served in the Vietnam War.

__label__politics (CNN) A Donald Trump foreign policy adviser pushed government agencies to review materials from the dark web in the summer of 2016 that he thought were Hillary Clinton's deleted emails, multiple sources with direct knowledge tell CNN.

Joseph Schmitz approached the FBI and other government agencies about material a client of his had discovered that Schmitz believed might have been Clinton's missing 30,000 emails from her private e-mail server, sources say. The material was never verified, and sources say they ultimately believed it was fake.

His push is the latest example of Trump advisers who were mixed up in efforts to find dirt on Clinton during the presidential campaign. Schmitz was one of the first people Trump named to his campaign's national security and foreign policy team. The team, showcased in a March 2016 photo , was thrown together early in Trump's successful run as he faced mounting pressure to prove his ability to pull in high-level advisers who could help prepare him for the White House.

Another adviser pictured in the photo, Trump's foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, was told by a Kremlin-connected professor that the Russian government had damaging material on Clinton. Six weeks later, Donald Trump Jr. got a message from a business associate offering similar information, leading to the Trump Tower meeting that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort attended.

Fired chief strategist Steve Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee in February that members of the Trump campaign "kept getting approached" by outsiders suggesting ways to get Clinton's emails, according to a source familiar with his testimony.

Schmitz's connection to the multi-faceted effort to expose damaging information about Clinton has not been previously reported. His status as a former Pentagon inspector general afforded him access to the agencies and a sophisticated understanding of the government bureaucracy. He was relentless, sources say, and truly believed his client had found important, sensitive material. He did not hesitate in his pursuit even though the material on the dark web -- a part of the Internet not easily accessible or traceable -- was questionable and many experts already believed the Russians had stolen Clinton's emails.

Schmitz met with officials at the FBI, the State Department and the Intelligence Community Inspector General -- the watchdog tasked with investigating Clinton's alleged mishandling of classified information. He claimed a source he called "PATRIOT," an unidentified contractor he was representing, had discovered what he believed was likely material stolen from Clinton that could contain classified information. Both the client and Schmitz were afraid that going through the material without permission could jeopardize their security clearances, though there is no indication their actions were illegal.

While officials at the State Department and Inspector General briefly interviewed Schmitz, they declined to review or accept the information, according to sources familiar with the process. The FBI interviewed him as a part of its ongoing criminal investigation into Clinton's emails, sources said. It is not clear whether special counsel Robert Mueller is pursuing information about Schmitz's efforts.

Schmitz then took a memo outlining his claims and concerns to the House Intelligence Committee. One cybersecurity expert outside the government who also saw the material on the dark web said the emails appeared to be fake, based on his review and the forum where they were posted.

"I'm pretty sure they were posted on the (dark web) equivalent of Reddit," the source said.

CNN made multiple attempts to seek a response from Schmitz, including approaching him in person Friday. He declined to comment for the story.

A former campaign official told CNN in a text, "The campaign doesn't comment on matters of interest to the Special Counsel or the Congressional committees." A source connected to the campaign's foreign policy team said he had no knowledge of Schmitz's efforts.

The FBI declined to comment on questions about interviews with Schmitz, as did special counsel Robert Mueller's spokesperson Peter Carr about whether Mueller had interviewed Schmitz or might in the future. The Intelligence Community Inspector General, State Department and House Intelligence Committee also declined to comment.

Meanwhile, Schmitz and his associates may still be a part of Trump's orbit.

A Trump team original

Schmitz became one of Trump's first five campaign foreign policy advisers in the spring of 2016.

Trump announced his role during an interview with The Washington Post that March , alongside the four other originals: counterterrorism speaker Walid Phares, former Lt. Gen Keith Kellogg, academic Carter Page and oil and energy consultant George Papadopoulos.

Schmitz, a former Pentagon inspector general in George W. Bush's administration as well as a co-worker and confidant of Blackwater USA founder Erik Prince, told the Chicago Tribune he had been working for the Trump campaign for about a month prior to the announcement, communicating closely with top Trump adviser Sam Clovis.

A photo posted to Trump's Twitter and Instagram in March 2016 shows all of the original advisers at a conference table with Trump, including now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Schmitz also attended the Republican National Convention with Page and other advisers, according to USA Today.

Schmitz counseled Trump "through the November election," according to a biography on his law firm's website. After Trump's election victory, he considered Schmitz as a possible Secretary of the Navy, first reported by the Daily Caller and confirmed by CNN's sources.

Schmitz is no stranger to controversy.

His background came under scrutiny when he was first named as a Trump adviser, including comments former colleagues alleged he had made downplaying the Holocaust -- accusations Schmitz has said are false and defamatory . In the private sector, Schmitz has represented anti-Clinton activist Wayne Shelby Simmons . Schmitz is connected to the Center for Security Policy, a far-right organization that has promoted anti-Muslim views.

The email hunt

While Schmitz tried to get the emails reviewed, other Trump campaign associates also pursued dirt about Clinton, including information that was potentially stolen.

Papadopoulos, who served on the foreign policy team with Schmitz, was told in April 2016 by a Kremlin-connected professor that the Russian government had "thousands of emails" that were damaging to Clinton. It's unclear whether the emails Papadopoulos was told about were linked to Schmitz's efforts. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October to lying to investigators and has been cooperating with Mueller.

Six weeks after Papadopoulos was told about the emails, Donald Trump Jr. got a similar message from a business associate who said the Russian government wanted to provide "information that would incriminate Hillary." A group of Russians visited Trump Tower to speak directly to Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort. Both sides deny collusion and say the meeting produced nothing.

Then there was Peter Smith, a well-connected GOP figure and Chicago investment banker who committed suicide after experiencing declining health in May 2017. He was openly obsessed with getting his hands on the deleted Clinton emails throughout 2016. There is no indication that Smith is connected to Schmitz's efforts or the Trump campaign.

In the fall of 2016, according to the Wall Street Journal , US intelligence officials picked up chatter likely between Russian hackers hoping to steal Clinton's emails and possibly get them to foreign policy adviser Michael Flynn and Trump's team through an intermediary.

Sources told CNN there was no indication that Schmitz was communicating with or influenced by agents of a foreign power when he brought the supposedly hacked material to US government agencies.

Peter Clement, a top analyst at the CIA on Europe and Eurasia before retiring in the winter of 2017, told CNN he was not aware of Schmitz but says it is "extremely plausible" that his penchant for conspiracy theories could have made him a target for various foreign influencers, including Russia. "There's a lot we don't know, but Russians during the campaign were clearly targeting specific groups and parts of the country," Clement said.

Additionally, Clement said Schmitz's business ties "would have made him stand out." His small law firm represents a major Russian airline previously sanctioned by the US State Department for arms deals with Iran.

(CNN) The average American journalist doesn't cover the White House. She is probably overworked, underpaid and frustrated that her stories don't have more of an impact. The average journalist is not powerful. But the media? Well, that's another matter.

This is a point The Boston Globe is seeking to make through an unprecedented appeal to news organizations across the country. The Globe editorial page has asked media outlets to publish coordinated editorials on Thursday, challenging President Donald Trump's attacks on a free press.

About 200 news organizations have responded thus far, from The Philadelphia Inquirer to The Denver Post. "This dirty war on the free press must end," wrote The Globe's deputy managing editor Marjorie Pritchard in making the appeal. "We are not the enemy of the people."

Trump's strategy of constantly vilifying and undermining individual journalists and media organizations serves a number of different functions. First, it's a very effective way of changing the subject when Trump comes under criticism in the media. Second, it's a form of harassment, that can intimidate pesky reporters, especially when the online trolls pile on. Third, it's a way of undermining public confidence in the media. According to "60 Minutes" correspondent Lesley Stahl, Trump said to her , "I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you."

In fact, the United States is experiencing a historic press freedom crisis. Four journalists and a media worker were killed in the Capital Gazette shooting in Maryland and a blogger was gunned down in Chicago under mysterious circumstances, making the United States one of the world's most deadly countries for journalists this year, behind only Afghanistan and Syria, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists data
__label__politics (CNN) A White House contractor wanted by police on an attempted first-degree murder charge was arrested as he came into work on Tuesday, law enforcement officials said.

The contractor -- identified by the US Secret Service as Martese Edwards -- was working for the National Security Council, a person familiar with the matter said.

A law enforcement official said Edwards, 30, of Suitland, Maryland, was wanted for attempted first-degree murder. But the precise details of the charges were unknown. He is expected to make his first court appearance Wednesday afternoon in District of Columbia Superior Court.

The person familiar said his badge access was only to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, not to the West Wing, where the President's offices are. A National Security Source source said Edwards was an "admin guy" in resources management, which handles room bookings, parking passes and other administrative matters.

In a statement, the US Secret Service said it was notified on Monday that Edwards was the subject of an arrest warrant issued by Prince George's County in Maryland, just outside of Washington.

And now, "Truth Isn't Truth."

Beset by the Trump-Russia investigation, worried that White House lawyer Don McGahn may have turned witness for Special Counsel Robert Mueller and trying to keep Donald Trump from committing perjury in a Mueller interview, Trump's lead lawyer Rudy Giuliani issued the new mantra on Sunday. He has since tried to explain his comments in a tweet

Trump and Giuliani may be rambling and close to incoherent, but they are not void of strategy. They are telling their true believers what they want to hear. But what is their ultimate political quest? It's to keep the rest of us confused.

Is there a "Deep State" -- i.e. US agencies -- plotting Trump's overthrow, or is that a concoction to quash scrutiny of the President?

Are journalists really enemies of the people rather than reporters doing their jobs, possibly to ensure accountability to the people?

Are terrorist migrants overrunning Europe, or is this a dog whistle to justify "zero tolerance" at home?

Is Trump the victim of "Fake News," or has he told 4,229 lies in just over 18 months in office?

The reality is, it doesn't matter what is true. And, frankly, they don't care in Trump Land. If Trump and his team can blow enough smoke and throw enough mud, we throw up our hands and give up on establishing what we do and don't know.

That gives them the space to tear down their obstacles: be it those concerned about the environment, assessing the real state of the US economy or carrying out an investigation into a likely conspiracy between Trump's inner circle and Russian officials.

This isn't novel. The Russian state has been pursuing this strategy for years --- and doing it quite effectively. A Russian-made nerve agent is released in southern England, but the Russians keep asking for more and more evidence while providing their own implausible counter-narratives. How do you really know that it was us? It's a play we've seen time again, from the Russian actors involved in the illegal annexation of Crimea to the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Election meddling? What election meddling?

Trump and Co. are far more chaotic and sometimes bumbling in their efforts. But if they are loud enough, the cacophony covers their own misdeeds and ineptitude.

This isn't quite the work of George Orwell. In 1984, the state still dealt in certainties, even if they were the certainties of deception. Believe in our Peace while we conduct War. Believe in our Freedom while we enslave you.

In Trump Land, there are no such certainties. There is confusion and contradiction. Each day, new lines -- angry, absurd, lying -- are put out. Each day we chase to establish the "truth." And the next day, while we are chasing, the next wave hits us.

Two plus two may equal five. Two plus two may equal 12. Two plus two may equal fish. Doesn't really matter, as long as we are never sure that two plus two equals four.

Truth is Not Truth.

And Ignorance? What's that got to do with anything?
__label__politics (CNN) Obamacare rates are going up next year.

The premium for the benchmark Obamacare silver plan is projected to jump an average of 15% next year, according to a Congressional Budget Office report released Wednesday.

The increase is being driven in large part because people will no longer be penalized for not having insurance, as of 2019. Congress eliminated the penalty associated with Obamacare's individual mandate as part of its tax reform package last year.

This change alone will cause premiums to be 10% higher because fewer healthy people will buy coverage, leaving insurers with a sicker and costlier group of policyholders, the CBO projected.

Going forward, the agency projects premiums will increase an average of 10% a year between 2019 and 2023 and then 5% annually between 2024 and 2028. Most of those who buy coverage on the Obamacare exchanges are shielded from these rate hikes because they receive federal subsidies.

__label__politics (CNN) A Democrat from Wisconsin running to replace House Speaker Paul Ryan in Congress was arrested and pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated in 1998, in addition to eight other arrests, according to documents obtained by CNN.

Two of Randy Bryce's arrests were more recent -- in 2011 and 2018 -- while protesting the policies of Ryan and Wisconsin's GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, but the majority of Bryce's arrests stem from a single incident of driving under the influence, including three times for driving with a suspended license.

Bryce launched his campaign in June 2017 to replace Ryan in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District and quickly became a rising star for many progressives because of his support for unions, Medicare for all, a $15 hourly minimum wage, paid family medical leave and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Ryan announced in April that he wouldn't run for re-election and CNN rates the race as competitive, though it leans Republican.

Bryce is facing Janesville School Board member Cathy Myers in a Democratic primary on August 14. Bryce had raised a total of around $4.8 million as of March 31, the most recent records available from the Federal Election Commission.

Bryce's time in the political spotlight has brought out some unflattering aspects of his past, including the revelation that he was two-and-a-half months delinquent on paying child support to his ex-wife in September 2015, and it took nearly two years for him to pay it off. And this week, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Bryce blamed unions for many people thinking that unions are useless and and outdated because, he said, "The labor movement has become lazy."

Bryce's multiple arrests, however, have not yet been reported on, other than those that occurred in 2011 and 2018.

According to public records obtained by CNN, Bryce was arrested in April 1998 for operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol -- or OUI-- in Schoolcraft County, a small, rural county in Michigan. Though Michigan law classifies the offense as an OUI, it's commonly known in other states as a DUI, or driving under the influence of alcohol.

Bryce initially pleaded guilty, then later failed to appear in court in Michigan and a warrant was put out for his arrest. Bryce ultimately appeared in court again in March 2003, where he was sentenced to 65 days in jail, though the judge immediately suspended the sentence, and Bryce received credit for one day served in jail and paid $850 in fines. He was also ordered to complete four days of community service.

In a statement to CNN, Bryce said, "There is no excuse for what I did 20 years ago when I got behind the wheel and operated under the influence. I made a mistake and I regret it. I've worked very hard to learn from my mistakes so I can be a man my son can be proud of. I'm not perfect, but I know the struggles working people go through. I understand the mistakes that any of us can make. I've certainly learned from mine."

Bryce has other arrests before and after his 1998 arrest.

In December 1991, on his 27th birthday, Bryce was arrested in Wisconsin for marijuana possession, property damage, trespassing and theft, through the theft and trespassing charges were dropped. Court records dating that far back are unavailable, and according to campaign spokesperson Julia Savel, Bryce says he doesn't remember the court's decision, though he says he didn't pay any fine or serve time and believes the charges were dropped.

After having his license suspended following his 1998 OUI in Michigan, Bryce was arrested three more times for driving with a suspended license and registration in Wisconsin.

In September 1998, Bryce was arrested in Milwaukee County and pleaded no contest to driving with a suspended license, for which he was ordered to pay a $124.90 fine.

In October 2000, Bryce was arrested in South Milwaukee for driving with a suspended license and had to pay a $1,000 bond. Bryce, who had recently begun working as an ironworker, didn't qualify for a public defender, and the court entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf. In December, he failed to appear in court and the judge issued a warrant for his arrest.

Bryce was arrested under the warrant in February 2001, and after being held in jail for one day, was released after paying a $500 bond. In March 2001, he pleaded guilty and paid a $200 fine.

In January 2003, Bryce was again arrested in South Milwaukee for operating a vehicle with a suspended license, though it was later amended to operating without a license. He pleaded guilty and paid a $100 fine instead of having a suspended license for another two years.

Regarding vehicular arrests that occurred after his OUI, spokesperson Savel released the following statement: "To put this in context, when this happened Randy had recently beaten a late-stage aggressive form of cancer during which time he didn't have health insurance. He was able to dig himself out of bankruptcy which was related to his mounting medical bills because he started his new career as a union ironworker. Randy has made mistakes, and as he said, there is no excuse for his actions. But he also has worked hard to right his wrong and grow from the experience, like so many other working people find themselves having to do."

Bryce's most recent arrests were for taking part in illegal protests.

In October 2011, Bryce was one of 19 people arrested for occupying Johnson's office in Milwaukee. Johnson was not in the office at the time, and Bryce was later found guilty and paid a $75 fine.
__label__world Story highlights New radar detections suggest a subsurface lake on Mars

(CNN) A lake of liquid water has been detected by radar beneath the southern polar ice cap of Mars, according to a new study by Italian researchers from the Italian Space Agency, published Wednesday in the journal Science.

Evidence was gathered by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding instrument, also known as MARSIS, on the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft.

Between May 2012 and December 2015, MARSIS was used to survey the Planum Australe region, which is in the southern ice cap of Mars. It sent radar pulses through the surface and polar ice caps and measured how the radio waves reflected back to Mars Express.

Those pulses reflected 29 sets of radar samples that created a map of drastic change in signal almost a mile below the surface. It stretched about 12.5 miles across and looked very similar to lakes that are found beneath Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets on Earth. The radar reflected the feature's brightness, signaling that it's water.

"We interpret this feature as a stable body of liquid water on Mars," the authors wrote in the study.

Among the dead are six men and four women, the agency said. A further six people were injured, including a child, the spokesman said.

Rescue operations started immediately after a small stream near the village of Civita overflowed at 5:30 p.m. local time, he said.

The operations are still underway in the flooded canyon area, as at least three more people remain missing. So far, 23 people have been rescued.

Rescue teams work at the gorge Monday in Pollino National Park.

More than a hundred emergency rescuers are searching for survivors, the spokesman said, adding that the number of people missing is unknown.

__label__world (CNN) North Korea believes there is a "strong possibility" of a second summit between the country's leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump, according to an official with close knowledge of Pyongyang's position on the matter.

The official pointed to a recent exchange of letters between Trump and Kim as a positive sign, adding that although the date and location of the summit have yet to be determined, it would take place "sometime later this year."

The news came as doubts mounted over whether Trump's historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June would deliver its goal of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.

At the weekend North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho called America's actions since the June 12 Singapore summit "alarming," highlighting economic sanctions and a lack of a Korean War peace treaty as major issues that could derail the nuclear talks.

The official said the latest North Korean statements were a "negotiating tactic to put pressure" on the Trump administration ahead of US midterm elections. North Korea hopes that Trump and Kim will negotiate denuclearization terms that are more favorable to Pyongyang, the official added.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Judge Brett Kavanaugh's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week offers senators their only real opportunity to challenge the Supreme Court nominee's legal thinking before he would take a lifetime appointment on America's highest court.

This time around, the stakes are higher because President Donald Trump's nominee is poised to succeed swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, the conservative-centrist who joined with liberals to uphold Roe v. Wade and abortion rights. Kennedy was also the decisive vote for same-sex marriage and university affirmative action.

But if past confirmation hearings are any lesson, Kavanaugh, previously a top aide to President George W. Bush, will try to reveal as little as possible while being as pleasant as possible.

Here's what to watch for this week:

Robert Mueller and executive power

Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election remains at the forefront of the political arena, and this will be no exception.

The Supreme Court could ultimately resolve disputes arising from that investigation, and senators have said they will ask Kavanaugh about his views of executive power and when the president can be subject to investigation and indictment.

Kavanaugh knows a thing or two about investigating a president. He worked as a deputy to independent counsel Ken Starr, going after President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Back then, in a memo, he explained why he felt it was necessary to get Clinton to answer questions under oath about White House intern Monica Lewinsky. In the memo, he suggested that the American people and Congress needed to know the full extent of the President's wrongdoing.

But after serving in the Bush White House, his thinking about pursuing a president seems to have evolved. In 2009, he wrote that having seen how "complex" and "difficult" the job was, he thought it was "vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible." He proposed that any criminal or civil claims against a president be deferred until he left office.

"(T)he indictment and trial of a sitting president," Kavanaugh wrote in a 2009 law review, "would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas."

Obamacare

For Democrats, health care is a possible way to win political points for the upcoming midterm elections at the hearings.

Democrats have said they worry that Kavanaugh would move to strike down popular provisions, such as the requirement that insurers cover everyone regardless of medical history and do not charge more for people with certain health conditions.

"I think this becomes the narrative of his nomination, which could bring it down," said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, according to the Los Angeles Times . "If people realize that their insurance is at risk because of this court nominee, I think there is going to be a lot of pressure put on a lot of people to vote no."

Trump has long criticized the 2010 Affordable Care Act and targeted Chief Justice John Roberts for his crucial fifth vote to uphold the law in 2012. "If I win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts on Obamacare," Trump tweeted in 2015.

When a DC Circuit panel upheld the ACA in 2011, Kavanaugh dissented on procedural grounds, rather than assessing the merits. He said it was premature to resolve a dispute that involved an insurance mandate to be imposed in 2014, with a tax penalty the following year. Yet as he dissented, Kavanaugh laid out limits on Congress' power to regulate commerce. The crux of the litigation at that point was whether Congress could order people to buy a product, that is, health insurance.

Government's authority over business

The Trump administration has vigorously worked to eliminate regulations on business, for example, in the workplace and over the environment. White House Counsel Don McGahn has said the administration has screened judicial candidates for an anti-regulatory focus.

Kavanaugh's thinking has been in sync with the administration. He has argued that regulatory agencies should exercise authority only when it is clearly spelled out in federal statutes, departing from the judicial practice of deferring to agency interpretations of an open-ended law. In one 2014 dispute, Kavanaugh criticized a Labor Department move to sanction SeaWorld following the drowning of a trainer by the orca Tilikum, declaring that the agency had "stormed headlong into a new regulatory arena."

More broadly, Kavanaugh has questioned an entrenched 1984 Supreme Court case, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, that says judges should defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous laws. That, Kavanaugh said in a 2017 speech, "encourages agency aggressiveness on a large scale."

Roe v Wade

Senators will ask Kavanaugh the same question that has come up in almost every modern-day confirmation hearing: Does he think Roe v. Wade, the 1973 opinion that legalized abortion, was wrongly decided and should be overturned?

The opinion is more than 40 years old, but it is still a flashpoint and opponents of abortion believe that Kavanaugh will deliver a fifth vote to either overturn Roe or cripple it.

Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who supports abortion rights, met with Kavanaugh last month and seemed satisfied that he will respect Roe. She said he'd called it "settled law" during their meeting.

But while lower court judges must abide by Supreme Court precedent, a Supreme Court justice has the latitude to try to reverse it. Supporters of abortion rights fear the worst, and Democratic senators will push him on the issue.

"It's not enough for Brett Kavanaugh to say that Roe is 'settled law,' " Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said in a tweet after Collins' comments. "Chief Justice Roberts said the same thing in 2005. Then he voted in favor of a law that would have forced 75% of Texas clinics to close. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."

Where are the documents?

Friday evening, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley was informed that the White House would withhold some 100,000 documents concerning Kavanaugh's record because administration lawyers believe the documents are covered by constitutional privilege. The disclosure infuriated Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, who called it the "Friday Night Document Massacre."

"President Trump's decision to step in at the last moment and hide 100,000 pages of Judge Kavanaugh's records from the American public is not only unprecedented in the history of Supreme Court nominations, it has all the makings of a cover-up," he said.

Grassley, an Iowa Republican, is refusing to supply records from Kavanaugh's years as Bush's staff secretary. On top of that, there are some documents that lawyers for Trump and the White House have labeled "committee confidential." Democrats say Grassley has deviated from the normal protocols concerning document delivery.

Grassley's office responds that he's made hundreds of thousands of documents available, and that Kavanaugh has issued more than 300 opinions that offer the best view of his jurisprudence.

Judge Kozinski, who resigned after sexual harassment allegations

Kavanaugh was a law clerk to Judge Alex Kozinski from 1991 to 1992 and has remained close to his former boss through the years. When Kavanaugh was nominated to the DC Circuit, Kozinski testified on his behalf at 2006 hearings, and Kavanaugh returned the praise and thanked him for helping his career.

Kozinski, who had sat on the California-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals since 1985, stepped down in December after numerous women accused him of sexual harassment . The federal judiciary dropped its investigation of Kozinski once he resigned. As part of that episode, the Senate panel already has scrutinized the judiciary's misconduct policies, and Democrats are likely to ask what Kavanaugh knew of Kozinski's behavior as they raise broader sexual-harassment concerns.

The White House issued a statement in July saying that Kavanaugh was never aware of allegations of sexual misconduct against his longtime mentor: "Judge Kavanaugh clerked for Alex Kozinski more than 25 years ago. Prior to the public reports late last year, Judge Kavanaugh had never heard any allegations of sexual misconduct or sexual harassment by Judge Kozinski."

Brown v. Board

During several hearings for lower court judges, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, has asked nominees whether they believe that the landmark civil rights opinion Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down the "separate but equal" doctrine in public schools, was correctly decided.

Wendy Vitter, a general counsel for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans who was nominated to a district court, said she didn't mean to be "coy" but that she thought it inappropriate to comment on Supreme Court decisions, "which are correctly decided and which I may disagree with." Her comments triggered outrage

Kavanaugh knows this question is likely coming, and there's nothing in his record to suggest he would question the validity of Brown.

When Roberts was asked this in 2005, he said: "The genius of the decision was the recognition that the act of separating students was where the violation was. And it rejected the defense -- certainly just a theoretical one given the actual record -- that you could have equal facilities and equal treatment."

Justice Antonin Scalia, for his part, way back in 1986, wouldn't even answer whether Marbury v. Madison, the 1803 opinion that asserted the power of judicial review, had been correctly decided.

"I don't think I should answer questions regarding any specific Supreme Court opinion, even one as fundamental as Marbury v. Madison," Scalia said. But he told senators he "ought to be in trouble" if they were to uncover anything he'd written disregarding the opinion, "without you asking me specifically about my views."

Misleading testimony?

Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, is ready to pounce on Kavanaugh, because the senator believes that 12 years ago, when Kavanaugh appeared before the Judiciary Committee as a nominee for a powerful appeals court, his testimony was misleading when it came to issues stemming from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

At the time Kavanaugh said, "I was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants."

Once he was confirmed, however, a Washington Post story recounted how Kavanaugh had participated in a meeting at the White House concerning whether enemy combatants should have access to lawyers. Durbin shot off an angry letter to the judge and said he'd been misled. But supporters of Kavanaugh say that while he may have participated in discussions regarding whether detainees should have the ability to consult with lawyers, he never participated in broader issues related to detainee treatment.

Kavanaugh's White House boss at the time, Alberto Gonzales, said in a recent statement that only a "limited number of personnel" were read into the sensitive legal issues surrounding the authorization of the use of enhanced interrogation techniques on high value detainees.

Richard Nixon and John Dean

Back in 1999, Kavanaugh said the landmark opinion that ordered President Richard Nixon to turn over White House recordings toward the end of the Watergate investigation might have been "wrongly decided."

The comments, made as part of an interview in Washington Lawyer magazine, were included in the thousands of pages of documents released by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The White House was quick to point to a more recent speech in which Kavanaugh praised the 1974 ruling, which rejected Nixon's claim of executive privilege to withhold the tapes. It was unclear if Kavanaugh had had a change of heart.

But in the age of Trump, whose 2016 campaign is under investigation, Democrats are sure to seek clarification from Kavanaugh.

John Dean, Nixon's former White House counsel, is scheduled to testify Friday.

Starr Report

Another topic from Kavanaugh's time with Starr would be his role as a co-author of the 1998 report that laid out grounds for Clinton's impeachment along with explicit details of sexual encounters between Clinton and Lewinsky. Kavanaugh also proposed hard-hitting, sexually charged questions as the Starr team was preparing to interview Clinton before a grand jury.

"The President has disgraced his Office, the legal system, and the American people by having sex with a 22-year-old intern and turning her life into a shambles -- callous and disgusting behavior that has somehow gotten lost in the shuffle," Kavanaugh wrote in an Aug. 15, 1998, memo to Starr and other lawyers.

Kavanaugh has expressed regret that the whole steamy report was publicly released but defended the vigor with which the Starr team pursued Clinton, who was impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted by the Senate.

__label__world Jerusalem (CNN) Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire agreement late Thursday, ending more than 24 hours of hostilities, according to a diplomatic source with knowledge of the negotiations. It was expected to go into effect at midnight local time.

The agreement was backed by Egypt and the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, which led efforts to negotiate the agreement. Both have repeatedly called for the restoration of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in previous months.

An Israeli official denied the existence of a ceasefire. Israel has not commented in other recent escalations about the existence of any agreements with Hamas. And as of late Thursday night, Hamas had not issued any statement about a ceasefire.

Israel had launched scores of airstrikes on Gaza over the past day, as Hamas militants fired rockets and mortars into its territory, prompting warnings over the risks of escalation amid efforts to achieve a long-term ceasefire agreement.

The fighting, which began Wednesday, left three Palestinians dead in Gaza, including a pregnant mother and her young daughter, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, with injuries reported in Israel and Gaza.

According to the Israel Defense Forces, more than 180 rockets and mortars were launched from Gaza toward Israel, with rocket alarms ringing into the early hours of the morning. Forty rockets were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome aerial defense system, while most others landed in open fields in southern Israel.

Several others landed in populated areas, injuring seven, according to IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus.

Smoke rises after an Israeli airstrike on Gaza City.

After the rocket launches, the Israeli air force struck more than 150 military targets across 20 sites in Gaza, including manufacturing facilities, weapons depots, training complexes, a maritime tunnel shaft and other sites, according to the IDF.

The Palestinian Ministry of Health identified those killed as 34-year-old Ali Ghandour, 23-year-old Inas Khamash and her 18-month-old daughter, Bayan Khamash. Twelve others were injured, the ministry said.

There was a brief lull in the hostilities Thursday afternoon, but by the evening, the two sides were exchanging fire again.

A series of Israeli airstrikes destroyed the Al Mashal cultural center near Gaza City, according to CNN producers in Gaza. The IDF said the building was used by Hamas' interior security forces.

Eighteen Gazans were wounded in the strike, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

"Hamas absorbed a powerful blow," an Israeli official said earlier in the afternoon. "Israel will continue to operate forcefully."

The strikes came after a rocket fired from Gaza landed near Beer Sheva, a major city in southern Israel about 50 kilometers east of Gaza.

It was the first rocket since the 2014 war to land near Beer Sheva, which is far outside the Gaza periphery, indicating a more powerful rocket was likely used.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman have ordered the Israeli military to be ready for any possibilities.

Escalation risk

Warning of the imminent dangers of continued escalation , UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov issued a statement early Thursday morning, saying: "Our collective efforts have prevented the situation from exploding until now. If current escalation, however, is not contained immediately, the situation can rapidly deteriorate with devastating consequences for all people."

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called on the international community to intervene to stop what he termed the "Israeli escalation on our people in the Gaza Strip," according to the official Palestinian news agency, WAFA. Such intervention was needed, Abbas said, to prevent "further destruction and instability."

A spokesman for Hamas, Abdul Latif al-Qanoa, said: "The Palestinian resistance is defending its people against the ongoing Israeli aggression on Gaza as part of its national duty."

However, US envoy Jason Greenblatt blamed Hamas for the violence. "This is the Hamas regime's choice," he tweeted. "Hamas is subjecting people to the terrifying conditions of war again."

Hamas regime again is launching rockets at Israeli communities. Another night of terror & families huddling in fear as Israel defends itself. This is the Hamas regime's choice. Hamas is subjecting people to the terrifying conditions of war again. — Jason D. Greenblatt (@jdgreenblatt45) August 9, 2018

The escalation came after Hamas leaders traveled to Cairo in recent days to discuss the possibility of a long-term ceasefire with Israel.

Khalil al-Hayya, a member of Hamas' political bureau, said in a televised interview on Al Jazeera on Wednesday that the general layout of a ceasefire agreement was in "advanced stages."

Israel's security cabinet has also discussed possible options relating to Gaza.

Israeli Minister of Transportation Israel Katz said over the weekend on Twitter: "The situation in Gaza is reaching a decision -- or an arrangement or a war." Katz said he would support an Egyptian-backed agreement that provided aid and rehabilitation to Gaza.

But on Sunday, following a security cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in Gaza, a readout of the meeting from the Prime Minister's office said only that the IDF chief of staff had briefed the cabinet on the latest developments in Gaza. No decisions had been made.

Months of violence

Earlier Wednesday, an Israeli tank struck a Hamas post in northern Gaza, after gunfire from Gaza damaged an Israeli engineering vehicle near the border fence.

In a separate incident on Tuesday, an Israeli tank struck a Hamas military post in northern Gaza, killing two militants. Israel carried out the strike after the IDF claimed Hamas snipers fired at Israeli security forces near the border. Hamas says the two men were taking part in an exercise and did not fire at Israel.

Hamas vowed to avenge the deaths, prompting Israel to shut down roads near Gaza for security reasons.

Palestinians rush to the border fence with Israel as mass protests take place on May 14 in Gaza City.

Efforts to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire come after months of violence along the Israel-Gaza border.

In late March, Palestinians began weekly protests dubbed the "Great March of Return" along the border fence. More than 160 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the protests, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

Israel has accused Hamas, which controls Gaza, of orchestrating the protests, during which the IDF says rioters have thrown Molotov cocktails, burned tires and hurled grenades. An Israeli soldier was killed by sniper fire from Gaza in late July, the first soldier killed along the Gaza border since the 2014 war.

Israel has maintained a land, sea and air blockade on the coastal enclave since June 2007, when Hamas took over Gaza.

The blockade effectively locks the more than 2 million Gaza residents inside the territory and is seen by the United Nations as a major contributor to the deterioration of living conditions there. Israel says it's a necessary security measure.
__label__politics Gingrich comment on shutdown labeled 'bizarre' by White House

Speaker: Clinton 'snub' was a factor

November 16, 1995

Web posted at: 12:15 p.m. EST

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As the government budget standoff continued Thursday, House Speaker Newt Gingrich indicated the Republican hard line was due, in part, to a "snub" from President Clinton during their recent trip to Israel for the funeral of assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta called the Gingrich comment "bizarre." (216K AIFF sound or 216K WAV sound)

The speaker said Wednesday that tough terms in the government spending bill President Clinton vetoed Monday night were included partly as the result of pique he and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole felt on Air Force One during flights with the president to and from Israel for the funeral.

Gingrich and Dole had complained earlier about their lack of discussions with Clinton during the 25 hours of flying time. But Gingrich went a step further Wednesday by saying the incident contributed to the government shutdown.

"This is petty," said Gingrich, indicating his displeasure at the way the two were treated. "You've been on the plane for 25 hours and nobody has talked to you and they ask you to get off the plane by the back ramp. ... You just wonder, where is their sense of manners? Where is their sense of courtesy?" (More from Dole - 120K AIFF sound or 120K WAV sound)

That "snub," the Georgia Republican said, was "part of why you ended up with us sending down a tougher continuing resolution" -- the stopgap spending bill that Clinton vetoed Monday. That veto led to the partial shutdown of the federal government, now in its third day.

"Not once did either of them say, 'Let's go in the back and sit down and try to cut a deal," Panetta said. "Frankly, it would have been inappropriate. Everybody knew this was about a funeral. ... This is bizarre. And even if that were the case -- which it isn't -- why would you want to shut down the government because you feel snubbed?"

__label__politics (CNN) Florida and Arizona hold primaries on Tuesday, teeing up the House and Senate races that will be critical to the balance of power in Washington come November.

Democrats must hold on to Sen. Bill Nelson's seat in Florida and win in Arizona's Senate race in order to have a shot a taking the majority in the Senate.

In Arizona, a Republican Senate candidate's reaction to Sen. John McCain's ailing health caused a last-minute controversy. In Florida, the Senate contest is already set, but both parties will select their nominees for governor in what is expected to be a competitive race in November.

Oklahoma is also holding a runoff election to determine who will be the Republican gubernatorial nominee. Democrats are eyeing this race as a potential flip this year.

What we'll learn tonight

WILL MCCAIN'S PASSING CHANGE THE RACE? Former state Sen. Kelli Ward walked back comments late Monday about the timing of the McCain family announcing he was stopping medical treatment and a tweet saying political correctness is a cancer. She apologized but also said the media misinterpreted some of her comments. McCain, who represented Arizona in both houses of Congress for more than 30 years, wasn't exactly embraced by any of the candidates in the race -- Ward, GOP Rep. Martha McSally or former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

They all ran towards President Donald Trump, in a sign of his hold over Republican voters. Ward was already lagging behind McSally, the establishment's favorite to defeat the likely Democratic nominee in the fall.

HAS TRUMP PERMANENTLY CHANGED THE GOP PRIMARY GAME? The President's endorsement of Rep. Ron DeSantis immediately affected the GOP contest to replace Gov. Rick Scott. DeSantis is riding the wave of the Trump endorsement with a smaller ground game than his top rival, state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam. Most statewide races come down to strong outreach and heavy media buys in Florida's diverse areas and media markets, but Trump's nod of approval may change that for Republicans. His strong support from the northern panhandle through the Gulf Coast in the South could prove that a tweet is mightier than the door knock.

CAN PROGRESSIVE DEMS SURPRISE? Progressives Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated powerful New York Rep. Joe Crowley in a primary in June, have both supported underdogs in key Florida Democratic primaries. If either Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum or activist Michael Hepburn can beat their better-known opponents, it would be a boost to the progressive movement, but it also might hurt Democrat's chances of flipping a vulnerable governor's mansion and House seat. Tonight's Democratic winner and the margin of victory will say a lot about the left in Florida. A united Democratic Party in Florida is vital to break the almost two decades-long GOP rule in Tallahassee, and with at least seven Republican-held congressional districts at play to flip, control of Congress may hinge on it as well.

What to watch tonight

ARIZONA (polls close 10 p.m. ET)

Flake's retirement after just one term gives Democrats one of their best shots at picking up a Senate seat. The GOP establishment hopes McSally can hold off far-right candidates Ward and the controversial Arpaio. Trump has yet to endorse a candidate in the race, having positive things to say about all three of them. On the Democratic side, Sinema is expected to easily defeat attorney Deedra Abboud and is already campaigning for November. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey could also be vulnerable this fall. Since the six-day teachers strike this past spring, education has emerged as a key issue in the race. Democrat David Garcia, an Arizona State University professor, is focusing on his experience in the area, but he faces tough challengers from State Sen. Steve Farley and Kelly Fryer, the CEO of the YWCA Southern Arizona.

CNN views more than half of Arizona's congressional districts as in play this year, with the 2nd District vacated by McSally as the most likely to flip. Hillary Clinton won the district in 2016, giving a strong start to either former Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick or 2016 nominee Matt Heinz, who are locked in a tight race for the nomination. The winner will be an immediate target of Republicans looking to keep control of the House.

FLORIDA (all polls closed at 8 p.m. ET)

Nelson's seat is vital in the battle for Senate control; both he and GOP Gov. Rick Scott are expected to skate through the primary to the general. The big drama will be in the primaries to replace Scott. On the Republican side, DeSantis hopes an endorsement from Trump will outweigh Putnam's attacks on DeSantis as an out-of-touch creature of Washington. On the Democratic side, Former Rep. Gwen Graham and Philip Levine, the former mayor of Miami Beach, look to be the front runners for the Democratic nomination. Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum could surprise Democrats here. Democrats think any of the three can win, pointing to the slim margin they lost by in 2014. In the House, keep an eye on the 27th District being vacated by retiring GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. CNN rates the race Lean Democrat. In the Democratic primary, former HHS Secretary Donna Shalala faces tough challenges from State Rep. David Richardson and Michael Hepburn, a former academic adviser at the University of Miami. On the Republican side, the endorsement from the Miami Herald could propel former Doral councilwoman Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera, who claims to have been abducted by aliens, to a stronger-than expected finish as she and several other Republicans try to catch front-runner Maria Elvira Salazar, a former TV reporter. CNN ranks eight Florida races as vulnerable in November, only one of which is currently held by a Democrat.

OKLAHOMA (all polls closed at 8 p.m. ET)

Runoff primary races in Oklahoma don't normally get a lot of attention, but the Sooner State could be see a big victory for Democrats this year. Republican Gov. Mary Fallin's popularity has fallen dramatically in her final months in office, giving Democrats some optimism that former state Attorney General Drew Edmondson could be her replacement. Democrats describe Edmondson's time in office as 'someone who fights for the little guy.' Former Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett and Tulsa businessman Kevin Stitt will face off in the Republican runoff Tuesday. Democrats admit Cornett's time in office in one of the state's biggest cities would put up a stronger fight in the fall. Stitt's business practices have come under scrutiny, giving Democrats hope should he prevail over the former mayor, they will have a strong chance to win.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Republican Rep. Ralph Norman pulled out his loaded, personal .38-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun Friday and laid it on the table at a diner where he was meeting with his constituents in Rock Hill, South Carolina.

Norman told CNN he wanted to make a point in the debate over gun violence.

"I merely proved a point that guns themselves are not the issue," he said.

Norman said that having a loaded gun in the room should, if anything, have made people feel more safe.

"Given the scenario that if someone had walked into that diner and began to fire a weapon, I told them I would be able to defend myself and them as well," he explained.

__label__politics "Do you at least have any interest in being president of the United States?" City Councilman Wendell Young asked him Friday — the first question to the former US attorney general as a who's who of Democrats in the Cincinnati area sat in a cramped law office conference room.

After his standard caveats -- he says it's something he needs to talk about with his family and won't actually decide on until early 2019 -- a confident Holder leaned in.

"Am I interested it?" he asked. "Yeah, I'm interested!"

Holder, the nation's top law enforcement official for six years under former President Barack Obama, has been publicly ruminating about a presidential run for months. His standard stump speech is littered with criticism of the Republicans in power. And with the Democratic field to take on President Donald Trump in 2020 wide open, Holder -- along with former Vice President Joe Biden -- could credibly claim the closest ties to the last Democratic president, a potent rallying point for a party in search of a standard-bearer.

Holder, who has traveled the country as head of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and raised money for Democrats in about a dozen states, has been up front about a potential presidential run, and his busy schedule has Democrats taking notice -- especially when his travels take him to states key to a presidential election.

Holder's travels have taken him to Arizona, Indiana and Ohio for state Democratic Party dinners, as well as Florida, Minnesota, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida and Georgia for events and meetings with local activists. Holder's meetings generally focus on combating gerrymandering, his cause célèbre since leaving the Obama administration, but his events are often peppered with politics and -- invariably -- comments about his future.

Few Democrats want to draw the scrutiny that will come with being out in front of the 2020 race, and Holder is no different. While he often acknowledges his aspirations when he gets asked about 2020, he also says he is more focused on what he thinks a presidential candidate needs than on his own future.

"(We need) somebody who has the vision for the job, somebody who has got the necessary experience, somebody who has the capacity, physical as well as mental," Holder told CNN during a trip to New Hampshire in June. "Somebody who also has the ability to inspire people, to make people believe government can be the force for good and make people believe in this thing we call America. (They) have to be able to move people, to bring up together in ways this President has clearly not done."

Over the last two months, though, Holder has appeared to move closer to running. And on Thursday in Columbus, Ohio, the former attorney general bluntly told CNN that he thinks he has what it takes.

"I think that I am OK when it comes to those five criteria where I set up," Holder said with a confidence that friends and former colleagues says is a trademark. "But there is a personal component to it as well. People say it, but it really is true. It is a familial thing: I have kids; I have got a wife who is going to help be a part of this decision. That is for next year."

The question Democrats are now asking: Is Holder the best person to take on Trump?

In early states Holder has visited, like New Hampshire and Ohio, Democrats have been impressed with his fundraising ability (his redistricting organization has raised $29 million since it was founded in 2017), his charisma in small events and the staff he has assembled around him.

"There are certainly a significant number of folks that would like to see him run," New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley said after his June visit. "It will be a tough decision by the 24, 36 of them because how do you differentiate yourself from the crowd? What we learned from Trump is that you really have to stand out or you risk not being recognized."

Rob Richardson, the Democratic candidate for Ohio treasurer, said Holder is "laying the groundwork" and, most notably, not knocking down speculation.

"He hasn't said no," Richardson said. "That usually is the clearest indication."

Holder's run would undoubtedly be unique -- no US attorney general has gone on to be President -- and the former Obama official knows he would likely face a field of possibly two dozen other Democrats competing to take on Trump

"I wouldn't be involved or do something simply to make a statement," he said. "I would only decide to get involved if I thought I could win."

And it was clear on Thursday during a criminal justice reform roundtable that Holder sees that any path to victory goes directly through his record and ties to the Obama administration.

"I am very proud of the work I have done in the Obama administration, and I think that will galvanize a lot of support, were I to make that decision," Holder said. "And I think it is the work that I did in the Obama administration (that) will hopefully give me a platform to support candidates."

The Obama ties

Obama and Holder speak regularly about the redistricting committee, an effort that the former President has championed since leaving the White House, aides to both men say.

Whether Obama has advised Holder to run for President is another question -- and something Holder wouldn't disclose.

"Let's just say that my conversations with the President are my conversations with the President," he said. "We have talked."

Although the two are personally close and Democrats who meet Holder invariably compare the two, their styles are markedly different. Where Obama became well known for sweeping rhetoric, Holder's appearances are more muted, wonky and a far cry from the fiery rhetoric and brash partisanship that has played out in Washington. Obama also burst onto the scene with little history but some electoral victories, while Holder has spent most of his life as a government official who, especially while working under Obama, incensed Republicans.

Holder, who has a constant self-confidence about him, seems to relish the fact that his mere presence annoys some on the right and admitted that a hypothetical run would send some on the right spinning. And it seems likely that he hopes he could provoke Trump as he did House Republicans.

During his two days in Ohio, Holder accused Trump of not moving the country forward, rolling back priorities solely because they had an association with the Obama administration and using his campaign to bring out latent "misogyny, homophobia, racism."

"Let's be frank about this. There is a racial component to this," he said of Trump. "A lot of the issues that Trump presented as economic issues were actually economic issues with a racial core."

Holder often does far more listening than speaking at events, including one where he gathered with Ohio gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray, lieutenant governor candidate Betty Sutton and a dozen African-American activists to discuss criminal justice reform. And his answers generally focus more on policy than politics.

But his wonkiness at times makes way for a playfulness about Trump and a 2020 run.

"Two guys from Queens," Holder said earlier this year, setting up a rhetorical race against Trump. "That would be interesting. New Yorkers know how to talk to other New Yorkers."

And when a member of the Hamilton County Young Democrats asked Holder about motivating young people, he joked about his age -- he's 67 years old -- and what motivated Obama supporters.

"You should be the most concerned, because the reality is I am in the end of the third quarter of this thing we call life," he said to laughs, before reminiscing about "magical" 2008, when Obama and his "beautiful" family was seen as "hip" and "cool" before they won the White House.

After the event, as he made his way to raise money for yet another Democratic hopeful, Holder -- bravado fully apparent -- joked that he was just as cool, if not cooler, than his close friend.

"I am definitely cool, and I am definitely hip and I am from New York City," he said to laughs from his aides. "So I check all those boxes."

(CNN) President Donald Trump ran for office as a populist. He swore to fight for the "forgotten men and women," a phrase he stole from FDR. But under his presidency, the middle class remains forgotten -- hammered is more like it.

President Trump's announcement that he wants to cancel the 2.1% pay raise for federal workers is just the latest assault on the middle class.

He sent a statement to Congress on Thursday saying we can't afford to give our people a measly 2.1% bump because -- are you ready for this? -- "We must maintain efforts to put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases."

Donald Trump is now worried about the debt. Are you kidding me? That's like John Dillinger worrying about gun violence. Like Kim Kardashian worrying about being overexposed. Like Donald Trump worrying about spray-tanning and pathological lying.

President Trump championed a tax cut that spends $1.5 trillion on the forgotten corporate class. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, when the GOP tax bill is fully implemented, an astonishing 83% of its benefit will flow to the top 1%.

The President's answer to the fiscal meltdown he is causing is not to ask those who've gotten the most to pay a little more. It's to hurt the folks who are already serving us.

Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, home to numerous federal workers, both in the D.C. area and the Norfolk naval region, called BS on Trump's newfound fiscal prudence.

"Let's be clear," Warner wrote in a statement, "the President's decision to cancel any pay increase for federal employees is not motivated by a sudden onset of fiscal responsibility. Today's announcement has nothing to do with making government more cost-efficient -- it's just the latest attack in the Trump administration's war on federal employees."

The American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represents 700,000 of the 2 million federal workers, is vowing to fight. "Federal employees have had their pay and benefits cut by over $200 billion since 2011, and they are earning nearly 5% less today than they did at the start of the decade," said AFGE President J. David Cox Sr. in a press release . He plans to push Congress to go over President Trump's head and mandate the pay hike.

I hope they win. After all, you get what you pay for. Do you want your overworked air traffic controller to be missing meals and feeling faint?

Or the scientists and doctors who are working around the clock to find cures for Alzheimer's and cancer and HIV/AIDS?

Should they get a pay cut? Do you want the men and women who take on the drug cartels to be worried about making their rent payment? Really?

Worse still, President Trump wants to end what's known as the "locality pay increase" -- an annual adjustment to assist federal workers in parts of the country where the cost of living is high -- like, say, the neighborhood Trump Tower is in. So TSA agents at LaGuardia Airport in New York, medical researchers in Atlanta, Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Los Angeles, homeland security professionals in D.C. -- all will suffer.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, the son of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, on Monday fondly remembered his father's friendship with the late Sen. John McCain, saying the two maintained ties despite their political differences.

"They both recognized and loved each other's passion. For my father's part, everyone knew how passionate (Ted Kennedy) was and that was known for John McCain. He really loved the fight, but he never let that get in the way of respect," Kennedy told CNN "New Day" co-anchor John Berman. "And that's what is missing in today's politics, that genuine respect for democracy."

Ted Kennedy, a Democrat known as the "Lion of the Senate," for his long tenure in the Senate chamber, died in 2009 from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. McCain died Saturday at the age of 81 on the anniversary of Sen. Kennedy's death from the same type of cancer.

Patrick Kennedy on Monday said McCain respected his father, despite his political affiliation.

"He knew that my father cared for this country. He knew that my father lost his brothers for this country. He knew that my father was part of this country and respected that. And my father genuinely loved and respected John McCain," he said. "It's an example of what we need today and that is that even though they disagreed, they were always searching for ways to put their country ahead of their party. It sounds trite, but no, not at all -- These days we're living in, we really need people to have that as their goal."

Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who went on to become the Democratic nominee.

In a surprisingly united vote, almost all members of the Democratic National Convention curtailed the ability of the superdelegates to vote on the first ballot for the party's presidential nominee beginning with the next election. The group of about 700 automatic, unpledged party leaders, elected officials and activists previously were able to back whichever candidate for the nomination they chose.

The move ended a vehemently contested debate that had pitted a majority of DNC members supporting the change against two former party chairs, members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and others who opposed the new rules. Both sides came together to pass the overhauled process ahead of the next presidential campaign.

Saturday's vote officially barred the superdelegates from voting on the first ballot to choose the party's presidential nominee unless a candidate has secured a majority of the convention using only pledged delegates, whose votes are earned during the primary process.

Beginning with the 2020 nomination process, candidates will no longer be able to count superdelegates if they want to win the party's nomination on the first ballot of voting at the convention. This makes it impossible for superdelegates to change the outcome of the pledged delegates' will, which has never occurred since superdelegates were created ahead of the 1984 campaign.

"Today is a historic day for our party," said DNC Chair Tom Perez. "We passed major reforms that will not only put our next presidential nominee in the strongest position possible, but will help us elect Democrats up and down the ballot, across the country. These reforms will help grow our party, unite Democrats, and restore voters' trust by making our 2020 nominating process the most inclusive and transparent in our history."

The change stems from a tumultuous 2016 primary campaign, in which Sanders' supporters accused the superdelegates of having too much influence over the outcome. The overwhelming majority of them supported Clinton.

The bitter divide within the party over the changes came to an unexpected close when former DNC Chairman Don Fowler, who was adamantly against the changes and led the opposition, moved to vote by acclimation instead of a ballot vote.

"You always want unity. I still am much opposed to most of what's in that document, but more people than I wanted it," Fowler told CNN after the vote. "You've got the elections to take care of in two and half months, then the convention and all the 2020 cycle starts. That's just a whole different ballgame."

The battle for superdelegates

Perez and DNC officials were pleasantly surprised by the change from Fowler and other members who were against the reform, but members of the DNC Black Caucus were split on the reforms, with those opposed in agreement with Fowler that the move was a form of voter disenfranchisement.

"The right to vote is sacred," said former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, who was against the changes, ahead of the vote. "It's an insult to democracy."

Other Black Caucus members like Michael Blake --who worked for President Barack Obama in the White House on African American outreach and engagement, refuted those charges.

"This is not disenfranchisement at all. The person that has their vote taken away and has been purged -- that's the person we need to be fighting for," he said Friday before the vote. "Voters want us to be listening to them, and this is a way to show that we are listening -- to show that we are understanding the changes that had to be made after 2016."

Democrats created a Unity Reform Commission at the last convention to study and recommend changes to the delegate process and other party reforms. Those recommendations were submitted to DNC committees for consideration and were amended for a full party vote at their meeting in Chicago.

Changes within party for more transparency, inclusion

DECLARING YOURSELF DEMOCRAT: Candidates seeking the party's presidential nomination will now have to declare themselves as Democrats in writing to the DNC, a change pointed at Sanders, who is technically an Independent senator that caucuses with the Democrats.

CAUCUS OVERHAULS: Caucuses have also undergone some changes as well. The party is officially encouraging states to use government-run primaries, give access to people who can't make the actual caucus (like shift workers, those with disabilities and language difficulties), implement same-day party change and voter registration, report statewide presidential preference on the first vote, and ensure that all national delegates represent the same original vote for the first caucus vote.

TRANSPARENCY: The DNC is now required to be more transparent on operations, finances, and dealings with Democratic presidential candidates, such as in providing information on fundraising, and vendor agreements. Information about these things should be made available to all Democratic candidates, the language says.

GENDER INCLUSION: Language for rules that mandate gender equality in committees, caucuses and other bodies has also been expanded to include members who are gender nonbinary . DNC committees and caucuses have included gender equality in the past, meaning they had to declare themselves male or female. Gender nonbinary members will no longer have to declare themselves as either. Instead, going forward the requirement now says the divide between those who identify as men and women have a variance of one.

How to win the Democratic nomination for president

Democrats who want to win the party's nomination in 2020 will now only be able to do that with pledged delegates if they want to avoid a floor fight at their convention.

Using simplified numbers (these do not reflect the actual number of delegates that will be voting at the 2020 convention), here's how it will work among the 1,200 total convention delegates (1,000 pledged and 200 unpledged):

SCENARIO ONE: A candidate earns a majority of pledged delegates only (501 to 600 pledged delegates).

OUTCOME: Only pledged delegates vote on the first ballot for president. The candidate with a majority of pledged delegates would then become the party's nominee.

SCENARIO TWO: A candidate earns a majority of the convention in pledged delegates (601 to 1,000 pledged delegates).

OUTCOME: Pledged and superdelegates can vote on the first ballot for president. The candidate with the majority wins the Party's nomination.

(In scenarios one and two, the nominee would be the same person; the only difference would be who would vote on the first ballot).

SCENARIO THREE: No candidate earns a majority of either pledged or all delegates in the primary contests, most likely due to multiple candidates having run during the 2020 process (1 to 500 pledged delegates).

OUTCOME: Only pledged delegates would vote on the first ballot, but with no majority winner, the party would then vote on a second ballot (and more if needed). Superdelegates would vote beginning with the second ballot.

Pledged delegates could still change their votes to avoid a second ballot if their candidate drops out and "releases" them, in which case they could vote for their personal preference. All delegates become unpledged after the first vote. The last Democratic convention to go beyond the first ballot was in 1952.

What stays the same for superdelegates

Superdelegates, like all other delegates, have other responsibilities at the convention, which are staying the same.

They are free to campaign and endorse the candidate of their choice at any time during the primary process. This has been a source of contention for some Democrats, who created rules to limit their ability to publicly endorse or campaign for presidential candidates. Those proposals failed in committee.

At the convention, they will still have complete floor access and be part of the hotel process to get their room assignments for the week. They remain eligible to serve on the rules, platform and credential committees. These are critical to the convention and the party.

On the floor, they can vote for a vice presidential nominee on all ballots however they choose.

Moving forward

DNC members came into the meeting wanting to chart their path forward for 2018 and 2020, despite the significant differences they had over the delegate changes.

Though some African American members still opposed the vote and had it recorded, the overwhelming majority of members on both sides came together to show their determination to win back Congress and the White House -- one of the biggest topics of discussion in their private conversations and meetings.

"I was skeptical of the proposal, but I'm a team player, and the most important thing we can do is elect Democrats this fall and in 2020," said DNC member Bill Owen, who supported Fowler's move. He went on to paraphrase another Democratic leader.

"John Kennedy said, 'Let us go forth from here to lead the land we love, asking his blessing but knowing God's work out here is truly our own," Owen said.
__label__world London, UK (CNN) A huge blaze tore through one of London's top hotels Wednesday, just days after it announced the completion of a multimillion-dollar renovation project.

More than 100 firefighters were sent to tackle the fire at the five-star Mandarin Oriental hotel, in the exclusive Knightsbridge district of the UK capital.

It was six hours before the blaze was brought under control, the London Fire Brigade said. Thirty-six hotel guests and 250 hotel staff were evacuated, it said.

The hotel group said it believed that everyone in the building at the time of the fire had been accounted for. The London Ambulance Service said Wednesday night that multiple crews had been sent to the scene but no one had required treatment.

First reports of the blaze emerged just before 4 p.m. Plumes of thick, black smoke were seen billowing into the air above Hyde Park as the fire took hold. Traffic in the area -- home to luxury stores Harvey Nichols and Harrods -- was brought to a standstill.

__label__world Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has emerged victorious in a high-stakes election, seeing off the most serious challenge yet to his political dominance and tightening his grip on the nation he has ruled for 15 years.

Defeating the twin threats of a reinvigorated opposition and a weakened currency, Erdogan declared himself the winner even before official results were confirmed.

With 97.7% of the votes counted, Sadi Guven, chief of Turkey's Supreme Election Board, said Erdogan had won an absolute majority, avoiding a runoff against his principal challenger, Muharrem Ince. State media put Erdogan on 52.5%, well ahead of Ince on 31%.

"The winners of the June 24 elections are Turkey, the Turkish nation, sufferers of our region and all oppressed (people) in the world," Erdogan said in a victory address from a balcony at the AKP's offices in the capital Ankara in the early hours of Monday morning.

The results were a blow to Ince and his Republican People's Party, known as the CHP, who ran a spirited campaign that threatened to force Erdogan into a damaging runoff and deny his party control of parliament.

Conceding defeat, Ince warned that constitutional changes ushered in by Erdogan earlier in the year represented a threat to the country's democracy.

"A single person is becoming the head of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary and this is a concern for a threat to the survival of the country," he told journalists. "Turkey has departed from democratic values and Turkey has broken its ties with the parliamentary system which it had."

"We're now in a one-man rule -- there's no mechanism to prevent arbitrary rule. We continue to have great concerns about this situation."

Expanded powers

Erdogan starts a new five-year term as president with sweeping new powers granted in a narrowly won referendum last year, denounced by his critics as a blatant power grab. Under the new system, the office of prime minister is abolished, parliament's powers curtailed and the president is accorded wide-ranging executive authority.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Monday that the implementation of the constitutional amendments "is important for our stability and economic development."

"It's a new system for us," he said, adding that it was approved by the Turkish electorate.

In any case, Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) and its allied Nationalist Movement Party's (MHP) retained their parliamentary majority.

"Turkey has decided to take the side of growth, development, investment, enrichment and a reputable, honorable and influential country in all areas in the world," Erdogan told cheering supporters.

Erdogan had earlier claimed victory in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city. "I would like to congratulate our nation once again. This has been another test of democracy and we have passed this test successfully," he said.

Supporters of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan celebrate outside the party headquarters.

Russia congratulated Erdogan on his re-election, with a government statement saying President Vladimir Putin "stressed that the outcome of the vote fully confirms Erdogan's great political authority, broad support of the course pursued under his leadership towards solving vital social and economic tasks facing Turkey, and enhancing the country's foreign policy positions."

Cheering supporters

After a day in which millions cast their votes, throngs of Erodogan supporters waited until the early hours of Monday morning to hear Erdogan speak. In the largest city, Istanbul, cars in the street and boats on the Bosporus honked their horns and fireworks lit up the sky.

Erdogan supporter Emine Kilic said that she was happy with the result, despite what she sees as virulent opposition to the ruling party.

"I think the election outcome is very very good but it could have been much better," she said from Istanbul. "That's because of the evil forces and many traitors inside the country. But still it's good we won!"

Others decried the result, fearing that the political climate was becoming more intolerant.

"I am very, very upset," Burcu, an Istanbul resident, said. "Really, really... as a young woman... I am only 25. I want to live in this country but as a young woman... it is becoming harder to live in this country, women are not respected and the education system is upside down."

Around 59 million people were eligible to vote in both presidential and parliamentary elections Sunday . Erdogan said the participation rate was 90%, an extraordinarily high number for any election.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan casts his vote in Istanbul on Sunday.

Cavusoglu, the foreign minister, lauded the turnout. "Turkish society is very engaged with democracy. If you look at the turnout rates its almost 90%. Under the leadership of our president, the ruling party will be working further to strengthen democracy."

Earlier, state news agency Anadolu reported that the President had sailed through the snap vote at 52.7%, with more than 96% of the ballots counted. It also said the AKP-MHP coalition had more than 53% of the parliamentary vote, with over 98% of the votes counted.

But the opposition CHP had said that around half the ballot boxes had not yet been counted, and called on party monitors to stay by the ballot boxes and keep watching.

People shout slogans and let off flares after counting of votes in Turkey's presidential and parliamentary elections commenced.

A spokesman for Erodgan's AKP, Mahir Unal, dismissed the accusations and warned party leaders of "harsh outcomes" to any provocations.

Opposition parties will have five days after the vote to lodge any complaints or challenges.

Candidate Muharrem Ince votes in the northwestern city of Yalova on Sunday.

Erdogan has dominated Turkish politics since his rise as prime minister in 2003 and has transformed the nation. He implemented policies that encouraged sustained economic growth and development, he challenged Turkey's secular foundations by bringing Islamic conservatism to public life and he gutted public institutions by having tens of thousands of people -- many of them his critics -- arrested after a failed military coup in 2016.

Erdogan himself called the snap elections 18 months early, as he faces battles on several fronts: Turkish voters are feeling the pain of soaring inflation, a plunging currency and high interest rates as the economy falters, and the normally splintered opposition is largely united against him for the first time in years.

By offering a wider than usual range of presidential candidates, the opposition had hoped to split the vote enough ways to leave the front-runner with less than 50% of the ballots.

Erdogan has won several consecutive elections to become Turkey's longest-serving leader, but a strong campaign by Ince triggered speculation the President might fail to win outright.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Rudy Giuliani said Friday that special counsel Robert Mueller has agreed to narrow the scope of a potential interview with President Donald Trump from five topics to two.

The former New York City mayor, who is now one of Trump's lawyers in the Russia investigation, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day" that Mueller is not considering asking the President about his former personal attorney Michael Cohen, who's under investigation in New York over his business dealings.

Giuliani -- who in the interview also touched upon whether Trump can obstruct justice, the President's latest charge that an FBI informant infiltrated his campaign and his belief that the FBI agents who raided Cohen last month are "stormtroopers -- said he can't go into much more detail about the potential interview, but that "the main focus we want ... is Russia."

"He is going to tell the truth and he has told the truth. He has no reason not to. There is no possible jeopardy here of any kind except from an unfair media," Giuliani said Friday.

A President can obstruct justice, Giuliani says

Giuliani noted that although it was Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey that led to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's appointment of a special counsel in the Russia investigation, there's no need for such a probe, because the President has "complete discretion to fire anybody he wants."

Asked by Cuomo if a President can obstruct justice, Giuliani replied, "he can, but in the case of firing a subordinate who is going to be replaced by somebody else on an active basis immediately."

He later added, "There were 10 reasons for firing Comey that have nothing to do with corrupt anything."

Giuliani's view contrasts with that of John Dowd, who previously represented Trump in the Russia investigation and claimed in December that the President cannot be guilty of obstructing justice because he is the country's top law enforcement officer.

'Perjury trap'

Although Trump said earlier this month that he would "love to speak" with Mueller, Giuliani said the special counsel's interest was in "trapping people into perjury."

The former US attorney pointed to a case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in which a federal judge said prosecutors' interest in the matter is because of Manafort's potential to provide material that would lead to Trump's "prosecution or impeachment."

"The President would testify tomorrow if it was about the truth. The truth is he had nothing to do with Russia," Giuliani said, adding, "The President is not going to lie."

Asked by Cuomo why Trump won't testify and say that, Giuliani said prosecutors would compare Trump's testimony to the account of Comey.

The New York Times , however, reported in February that Trump's legal team is reluctant to allow the President to accept an interview with Mueller over concern that Trump might incriminate himself through false statements and could be charged with lying to investigators.

Giuliani questions whether there was FBI informant in Trump campaign

JUST WATCHED Cuomo presses Giuliani on claim about 'informants' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cuomo presses Giuliani on claim about 'informants' 01:23

Trump and his allies have seized on a recent New York Times report that at least one government informant met several times with Trump campaign advisers Carter Page and George Papadopoulos,. The President has pointed to the reporting to criticize the Mueller investigation, and said Thursday that if the report is true, he is a victim of a scandal that is "bigger than Watergate."

Giuliani, however, said he didn't know for sure if there were informants embedded with the Trump campaign who spoke to federal authorities.

"Here's the issue that I really feel strongly about with this informant, if there is one. First of all, I don't know for sure, nor does the President, if there really was. We're told that," he said.

Giuliani said Trump's lawyers "were told there were two embedded people in the campaign" and that the Times' report "corroborates what people told us off the record."

But, Giuliani added, "You don't know if they're right or not."

Doubles down on 'stormtroopers' comment

Giuliani made headlines earlier this month when he said FBI agents who participated in raids against Cohen acted like "stormtrooopers," a term that originated during World War I to describe German assault troops but has also been applied to enforcers of the early Nazi Party during the rise of Adolf Hitler.

"You don't go into a man's house in the morning for a case that's 10 years old," said Giuliani , a former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, which executed search warrants authorizing the raids. "I know to say it, they are, and stick with it and accept it and own it. You are stormtroopers. The men and women were off base in what they did."

(CNN) On Twitter on Sunday morning, President Donald Trump wrote, "The Liberal Left, also known as the Democrats, want to get rid of ICE, who do a fantastic job, and want Open Borders. Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable!" But Trump's claim that Democrats want "open borders," like so much of what Trump says, is a lie intended to mislead the American people. Democrats are absolutely not calling for that.

What's true is that we're seeing an increasing number of visible Democrats calling for an end to ICE -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- because as Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.) put it , "ICE is tearing apart families and ripping the moral fabric of our nation." This past week, Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) joined with Vermont's Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders to call for ICE to be dismantled and replaced with a new agency. Pocan even introduced legislation to abolish ICE.

What Trump is trying to do is to manipulate people into believing that ICE is charged with policing our border crossings. It's not. That's the job of the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP.) As explained on the federal government's own website , CBP "is responsible for protecting our nation's borders in order to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States, while facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel."

So, what does ICE do? Well its own website explains that "the majority of immigration enforcement work for ICE takes place in the country's interior." In other words, ICE programs and its agents work to "secure a lawful workforce," "enforce immigration laws," and "find and remove illegal aliens who are criminals, fugitives or recent arrivals."

By way of a brief background, ICE came into being in 2003. Prior to that, from 1933 to 2003, ICE's current task was handled by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS.) But that changed after 9/11 when the federal government was reorganized to deal with the threat of terrorism. INS was abolished and, in its place, came ICE, a part of the Department of Homeland Security.

Under President Barack Obama, ICE was at first used aggressively -- deporting more people than any previous administration. But that changed in 2014 when the Obama administration instructed ICE officials to prioritize who they deported -- with the focus on undocumented immigrants who threatened public safety or national security, had ties to criminal gang activity and the like. Add to that, the Obama administration gave officials discretion -- before seeking deportation -- to take into account factors such as if the person had lived in the United States for a long period of time, had a family and was a contributing member of the community.

Well, Trump ended that policy with one of his very first executive orders in January 2017. Trump then ordered ICE to arrest and deport anyone who was in the nation undocumented, not just those who were deemed dangerous.

Trump, who promised during the campaign to create his own personal militia known as a " deportation force ," had effectively transformed ICE to be just that. The result is that in 2017, ICE arrested and deported 46,000 people without criminal records, which is a 171% increase in the number of non-criminals over the year before.

ICE is now going after undocumented parents dropping off their children at school, as we saw in New Jersey in January. In that case, the two undocumented fathers arrested by ICE had no criminal records and were Christians who had fled Indonesia for fear of religious persecution.

In February, ICE arrested an undocumented woman in a Texas courthouse who was there seeking a restraining order because she alleged her boyfriend had been physically abusive. Think about the message Trump is sending by doing this. He's telling undocumented women who are victims of domestic violence to suffer in silence because if they go to court for help, they may be deported.

And the list goes on.

But it's not just Democrats calling for reform. This week a group of ICE agents signed a letter called on the DHS Secretary to reform the agency because the actions of those who are leading the raids against undocumented immigrants are, in their view, hurting the reputation and effectiveness of the agency.

This is what Democrats mean when they say "Abolish ICE." It's not open borders as Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) made clear in a recent tweet pushing back on Trump's lie: "Open borders, @realDonaldTrump? The bipartisan immigration bill I authored had $40 billion for border security and would have been far more effective than the wall."

But, to me, all the problems with ICE emanate from one person: Trump. They are carrying out Trump's polices. That's why if we want to be effective in ending Trump's un-American family separation policy, his use of ICE as a personal deportation force and his unilateral ending of DACA, our focus must be this: "Abolish the Trump administration" by winning the midterms and the 2020 election.
__label__world (CNN) Even though an airport employee stole a plane and flew it for an hour before crashing, a Port of Seattle official said "all security protocols were handled appropriately" at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

Commissioner Courtney Gregoire said the employee, Richard Russell, had a security badge, and that all employees are subject to background checks.

She said the Friday night incident was a "one-in-a-million experience."

But she also said the airport, often known as Sea-Tac, will work on possible security improvements.

"Our airport director, our head of security (and) our airport operations team have been on the phone with lots of airports," Gregoire told reporters Monday.

"We'll be working through some of those associations nationally and internationally."

Human remains found

On Sunday, investigators found human remains in the wreckage of the stolen Horizon Air plane.

The remains are almost certainly those of 29-year-old Russell, from Sumner, Washington. But the FBI is waiting for confirmation from the local medical examiner's office.

Russell was the only person aboard, the Pierce County Sheriff's Department said. The Sheriff's Department described Russell as suicidal but did not elaborate.

Authorities said Russell took off in the stolen plane at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, flew for about an hour with military jets chasing him and crashed the 76-seater on a heavily wooded island.

The flight data recorder and components of the cockpit voice recorder have been recovered and are with the National Transportation Safety Board, according to the FBI.

The Horizon Air plane is unrecognizable, said a NTSB official. The plane went through several 100-foot-high lines of trees and was fragmented from the crash into pieces tiny enough to pick up, NTSB Western Pacific Region chief Debra Eckrote said Sunday.

"You couldn't even tell it was a plane except for some of the bigger sections, like the wing section," Eckrote said. "Even the small sections, most of it doesn't resemble a plane."

The flight data recorder is burned but intact, Eckrote said, and will be shipped tomorrow. It is expected to arrive in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, she said. Analysis will begin midweek. It is unknown when the full analysis will be completed.

'A complete shock' to the family

The plane crash has left Russell's family devastated.

"This is a complete shock to us," the family said Saturday night. "We are devastated by these events, and Jesus is truly the only one holding this family together right now."

Russell had worked as a Horizon Air ground service agent for 3½ years. His job included directing aircraft for takeoff and gate approach, handling baggage and tidying and de-icing planes.

Russell, or "Beebo" as some called him, was "a faithful husband, a loving son and a good friend," his family said. They also said he was "kind and gentle to each person he met."

Officials don't believe Russell had a pilot's license, and they don't know how he knew to fly the plane. Jeremy Kaelin said he worked with Russell in 2016, and remembered "happy, funny" chats with him in the break room.

"He was a nice guy," Kaelin said. "He was definitely one of the harder working people on the ramps."

Military jets did not bring the plane down

Russell had worked a shift Friday when he took a plane parked in a maintenance area of the airport, said Brad Tilden, CEO of Alaska Air Group, which owns Horizon Air.

He used a vehicle known as a pushback tractor to move the empty turboprop plane and took off without authorization at 7:32 p.m. Friday, officials said.

Russell flew for about an hour, talking periodically with air traffic controllers and making turns and even some aerobatic maneuvers as two armed F-15 jets followed him, officials said.

JUST WATCHED Hear audio from before plane crash Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hear audio from before plane crash 01:12

Video from a witness on the ground shows the plane at one point pulling up for a loop, putting the aircraft upside-down and then pulling back up just feet above a body of water.

The plane eventually crashed on sparsely populated Ketron Island, starting a fire in the woods and killing Russell. No one outside the plane was injured, officials said.

The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, but authorities said the F-15s did not bring the plane down.

Security concerns

The FBI said it does not consider the incident terror-related but the theft of a commercial aircraft from a major US airport has exposed a gap in airline security.

Authorities will try to piece together how a security scare of this magnitude occurred at a major airport.

Experts said the crash exposed alarming holes in airport security, and is likely to prompt a major review of industry security measures.

"This is going to be a major learning event for the industry," CNN aviation analyst Justin Green said. "This is a really big deal."

Russell managed to steal the Horizon Air turboprop from a maintenance area by himself. He was in uniform, had proper credentials and had clearance to be in secure aircraft areas, said Tilden, the airline CEO.

"They're credential employees. They're there to work on the airplanes. ... This is aviation in America. The doors of the airplanes are not keyed like a car. There is not an ignition key like a car. The setup in aviation in America is we secure the airfield," Tilden said.

Russell appeared to have broken protocol several times. He shouldn't have been able to board the plane alone and go unnoticed. He also moved the plane by himself while protocol calls for two people to tow an aircraft.

"The fact he was out there by himself, towing the aircraft by himself ... then moving the tracker out of the way, so he could get on the aircraft and move. The fact that all of that happened without even being noticed by anyone on the ground service crew, that is just phenomenal to me," said CNN analyst and former FAA safety inspector David Soucie.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Conservative political provocateur Roger Stone met in May 2016 with a Russian who offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton in exchange for $2 million, Stone and former Trump campaign communications official Michael Caputo told CNN on Sunday.

The meeting was first reported by The Washington Post

Stone and Caputo say the meeting was part of a larger effort by law enforcement to set up the Trump campaign, citing records suggesting that the man Stone met with is a Russian national who has claimed to be an FBI informant.

In letters to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes obtained by CNN, lawyers for Caputo and Stone say Caputo arranged a meeting between Stone and the Russian man who called himself Henry Greenberg.

Caputo and Stone did not disclose the meeting to congressional investigators, but it has become a focus in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign, according to the Post.

In the letters to Nunes, the two political operatives assert that they were transparent in their testimony before the committee, despite not disclosing the meeting with Greenberg.

Caputo told CNN he communicated with Greenberg by phone, and while he recognized that Greenberg had an accent, Caputo "assumed he was a US citizen."

"It was May 2016," Caputo added. "Nobody was talking about Russia, collusion, etc."

Caputo said he now believes the Russian who met with Stone was an FBI informant because "the OSC (Office of Special Counsel) knew more about it than I did." He added that it was not until prosecutors informed him that Greenberg was Russian that he learned the man he had spoken with in 2016 was not a US citizen.

"I was under the understanding that he was an American citizen of Russian descent," Caputo said. "I had no reason to believe that, I just assumed it."

The letter from Caputo's lawyer states that during his testimony with the House Intelligence committee, he "answered all questions with candor and to the best of his recollection."

However, Caputo's lawyer wrote that during his interview with the special counsel, which took place more than a month ago, "his recollection was refreshed regarding one brief interaction with a Russian national in May of 2016."

"In the course of his interview with the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, this specific contact was not discussed since at the time of this interview, Mr. Caputo had simply forgotten about this brief encounter in 2016," the letter states.

Caputo's lawyer relayed that he would be willing to brief the committee on the matter.

In his letter to Nunes, Stone's lawyer similarly called the testimony "entirely truthful," adding that Stone "feels obligated" to disclose the meeting because of "information brought to his attention after his appearance."

The letter states Greenberg approached Stone "wearing a Trump MAGA hat and T-shirt and spoke with what was possibly a Russian accent."

"Prior to meeting, Mr. Stone did not know anything about Mr. Greenberg, including his background or nationality. At the meeting, Mr. Greenberg proudly showed Mr. Stone photos of Mr. Greenberg and friends at several South Florida Trump rallies," the letter states.

Stone's lawyer described the encounter as a "one-time, 20-minute interaction" and stated that Greenberg offered Stone the "non-specific, damaging Clinton information" in exchange for a $2 million payment from Trump, but that Stone declined.

Stone told CNN he was disclosing the meeting now because "Mr. Caputo only brought this to my attention recently."

He also said he never discussed the meeting with the Trump campaign, nor anyone else, adding that it was "so ludicrous that I forgot about it."

California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Stone's testimony "appears inaccurate or deliberately misleading" and that the offer to Caputo "could not plausibly have escaped his recollection." Schiff called for the committee to provide the special counsel investigation with transcripts of their interviews and knocked the Republicans who control the panel.

"The truthfulness of many of our witnesses has been difficult to ascertain, which is why I have urged the committee to make the transcripts available to special counsel Mueller for a determination whether any witnesses committed perjury before our committee," Schiff said. "The majority's unwillingness to do so demonstrates that protecting the President remains its paramount objective, even when it means shielding witnesses who may have testified before us untruthfully."

President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, told CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday that he doubts Trump knew about Stone's meeting.

"I doubt it. I certainly didn't know about it. It's news to me," he said.

Greenberg, who the Post said sometimes went by the name Henry Oknyansky, had difficulties with the American immigration system, and spent two years in the custody of immigration services before returning to Russia. In 2015 court filings related to his immigration status cited by Stone and Caputo, Greenberg claimed that he worked as an FBI informant for 17 years.

However, Greenberg denied he was acting on the FBI's behalf when he met with Stone, according to the Post, and the court filing the newspaper obtained said his work with the FBI halted sometime after 2013.

The letters from the two political operatives' lawyers mention a text exchange after the meeting with Greenberg and say Stone's impression was that the meetup had been a waste of time and he viewed Greenberg as "a nut."

The exchange was obtained and published by the Post.

"How crazy is the Russian?" Caputo asked.

"Wants big &$ for the info- waste of time," Stone replied.

Caputo then texted, "The Russian way. Anything at all interesting?"

"No," Stone said.

An FBI spokeswoman and a spokesman for Mueller's office declined to comment to the Post.

The meeting with Stone reportedly took place a few weeks after former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos was told about Russian dirt on Hillary Clinton and two weeks before senior members of the Trump campaign met with Russian nationals -- including a lawyer with ties to the Kremlin -- in Trump Tower.

Greenberg initially denied Stone's account of the meeting but later changed his story, giving the Post a brief description of the meeting that matched Stone's depiction in part.

While Stone told the Post that Greenberg was alone for the meeting, Greenberg relayed that he was accompanied by a Ukrainian man only identified as Alexei. Greenberg told the Post that Alexei was fired from the Clinton Foundation. He also denied he asked for money, saying played a limited role in the meeting and left it to Alexei to talk with Stone while he sat at a nearby table.

Stone told CNN he had never heard of Alexei, nor was this person present at the meeting.

The Clinton Foundation also told the Post that they had never hired someone with the first name Alexei.

A news release from Caputo following the Post story states that in his meeting with the Special Counsel's Office, he "noted the Mueller team knew far more than he did about the Greenberg approach."

After his meeting with Mueller, Caputo investigated Greenberg, the release said, and he put the information he found into a dossier online.

(CNN) I don't want to be giving Donald Trump any bright ideas. Goodness knows he has enough of his own. But his latest -- a list of six former national security types whose security clearances may be revoked -- sounds an awful like the first fledgling move toward a Nixon-style enemies list, like the one that ensnared me four decades ago.

It is a cautionary tale of a time long, long ago, sadly all but forgotten. It shouldn't be.

In early February 1972, I was a reporter on the metropolitan staff of the New York Times when a top aide to John Ehrlichman, assistant to President Nixon for domestic affairs, reached out to me. My friend, Ehrlichman's aide, had just left the White House and had taken with him a large binder with internal memorandums circulating as the administration worked its way through the incendiary issue of whether to bus inner-city minority children to predominantly white schools to equalize educational opportunities.

Over the next several weeks, I worked with the Times' chief White House correspondent, Robert B. Semple Jr., to produce a front-page story based on these memos that ran on March 19, 1972: " Busing and the President: The Evolution of a Policy ."

In the end, among several documents we had not used was a striking memo from Patrick Buchanan, a top Nixon aide, that held, "The ship of integration is going down, and we should not be aboard." Lewis Lapham, editor of Harper's Magazine, agreed to run it in the issue of June 1972 with a small footnote naming me as the source. The day it appeared, the phone rang in my office. It was Buchanan's unmistakable voice. "Where'd you get that memo?" he snarled. "Oh, it came in over the transom," I replied calmly. "You'd be amazed what else can crawl in over that transom," he warned, and the line went dead.

__label__world (CNN) A politician was forced to leave a state parliament during a vote because she brought her baby, highlighting the difficulties faced by lawmakers with children.

Madeleine Henfling, a Green Party member of the state parliament of Thuringia in east-central Germany, tried to vote on Wednesday while carrying her 6-week-old baby.

Her participation would have taken a few minutes.

However, Christian Carius -- Thuringia's state parliament president -- told Henfling that babies are not allowed in the plenary hall. The session was suspended for 30 minutes while the issue was discussed.

According to current Thuringian state law , babies and children are not specifically banned from being inside the state parliament.

Nonetheless, the parliamentary advisory committee ultimately decided that Henfling would not be allowed into the plenary hall to vote if she brought her baby with her.

"We have made an inquiry into whether or not children are allowed in the chamber, and this examination and a decision by the board of governors has shown that we believe that young children are not allowed in plenary and I would ask that we also, for reasons of child protection, follow these rules," said Carius.

There are no childcare facilities at the Thuringia state parliament in Erfurt. When Henfling returned to parliament on Thursday, she brought her mother, who cared for the child while she participated in voting.

Regarding Carius' decision, Henfling told CNN: "It's a typical old man's thinking. I know a lot of men who think differently than this. But for someone to say: You should just give your 6-week-child to a babysitter, especially if you are still breastfeeding them, that's just not reality. Not for a mother. He doesn't know what problems you have with a child. The easiest thing is really to take the child with you at this age because they sleep all the time."

The Green Party is currently debating whether to take the case to court, arguing that Henfling was prevented from carrying out her elected duty.

Change is slow but coming

Politicians around the world have been praised in recent years as more and more lawmakers bring their children to work and breastfeed them.

Unnur Brá Konráðsdóttir, an Icelandic politician, captured headlines in 2016 when she breastfed her child during a debate on the proposed Foreigners Act.

In 2017, a 2-month-old baby -- the newborn daughter of former Queensland senator Larissa Waters -- became the first in Australia to be breastfed in the country's parliament.

Australia had previously changed its parliamentary rules, allowing politicians to take their children into the chamber.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) New satellite images show North Korea has made rapid improvements to the infrastructure at its Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center -- a facility used to produce weapons-grade fissile material, according to an analysis published by 38 North, a prominent North Korea monitoring group.

Captured on June 21, the photos reveal modifications to the site's plutonium production reactor and the construction of several support facilities -- long-planned upgrades that were already underway before North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump met in Singapore earlier this month.

When contacted by CNN about 38 North's analysis, the Unification Ministry said they "cannot confirm the report" and are "watching it closely."

The report states that "continued work at the Yongbyon facility should not be seen as having any relationship to North Korea's pledge to denuclearize," but the photos suggest that Pyongyang continues to proceed with business as usual when it comes to maintaining its nuclear sites following the summit.

"No change is actually a pretty significant story ... this is still an active site producing plutonium for North Korea," according to Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.

__label__politics Story highlights Millennials will be the largest voter-eligible group in the 2018 midterms

This steady shift in the electorate's composition should benefit Democrats

(CNN) In 2018, the American electorate will cross a historic threshold that could reshape the political balance of power-or leave Democrats fuming in frustration at continued Republican dominance of Washington.

For the first time, millennials next year will pass baby boomers as the largest generation of Americans eligible to vote, according to the well-respected demographic forecasts from the States of Change project at the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy group. That transition will end a remarkable four decades of dominance for the baby boomers, who have been the largest generation of eligible voters since 1978, when they surpassed what's been popularly referred to as the Greatest Generation (or G.I. Generation) raised during the Depression.

This steady shift in the electorate's composition should benefit Democrats. The baby boom, which is predominantly white, has drifted reliably toward the GOP in recent years: both Mitt Romney and Donald Trump carried about three-fifths of whites older than 45, exit polls found. By contrast, when compared to older generations, the millennial generation, which is more racially diverse and less religiously devout, votes more often for Democrats, expresses more opposition to Trump and professes more liberal views, particularly on social and environmental issues.

But the impact of this change will be muffled if millennials continue to vote at much lower rates than their elders, particularly in midterm elections like 2018. Though millennials are on track to soon surpass baby boomers as the largest generation of potential voters, experts caution that because of their lower turnout it may still be years until they exceed their elders among actual voters. With polls now consistently showing a huge generation gap over Trump in particular and the parties in general, the next several elections could hinge on how fast millennials convert their potential influence into actual power at the ballot box.

The long-term electoral shift from the baby boom and older generations toward millennials is unmistakable. The first millennials -- generally defined as the generation born from 1981 to 2000 -- entered the electorate in 2000. At that point, according to Census figures analyzed by States of Change, they represented just four percent of eligible voters; baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) constituted nearly 10 times as many eligible voters, at 39%. By 2016, the two generations had virtually converged, with Census figures showing that baby boomers represented just over 31 percent of eligible voters, and millennials just less than 31%. (In the process, millennials surged past Generation X, Americans born between 1965 and 1980, who comprised about one-fourth of eligible voters last year.)
__label__politics (CNN) US forces in Afghanistan confirmed Sunday that the head of ISIS in the country was killed in a strike a little over a week ago.

The strike, on Saturday, August 25, was in the eastern area of Nangarhar province and killed Abu Sayed Orakzai, according to a statement from US forces in Afghanistan.

CNN reported previously that the ISIS leader and 10 other fighters from the terrorist group were killed in an airstrike, according to provincial spokesman Attaullah Khogyani.

Khogyani told CNN previously that Afghan and coalition forces carried out the strike after receiving intelligence from Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security.

"America and her allies are in Afghanistan to maintain pressure on the networked, trans-regional terrorists attempting to plot, resource and direct attacks from here," Army Gen. Scott Miller, commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement Sunday. "This is only part of the coalition's work towards an Afghan security solution, but it is a vital part."

__label__politics (CNN) The looming verdict for President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman and new questions about what exactly the White House counsel told special counsel investigators, combined with Trump's increasingly combustible Twitter feed, have put the feeling of climax in the air.

Jury deliberations in Paul Manafort's first (of two) trials are expected to end this week, and whether special counsel Robert Mueller can secure a guilty verdict against the man who led Trump's campaign will be a pivotal moment for the probe, which Trump continues to attack as a "witch hunt."

Alongside the news that White House counsel Don McGahn spent more than 30 hours with investigators, it seems that Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 elections and possible conspiracy has tentacles that could be moving in directions the public does not yet understand.

A source told CNN that McGahn did not provide information that would be incriminating to the President, but Trump's lawyers also admitted they did not get a readout from the top White House lawyer about what he said.

It bears mentioning on a daily basis that no matter what happens, Trump's presidency will make history; the US has never encountered an administration like Trump's, where the chief executive is convinced the government he leads is out to get him.

And history was much on Trump's mind as he dispatched his takes on Watergate and McCarthyism on his Twitter feed over the weekend.

Rewriting history

Trump was alleging McCarthyism over the weekend, but it's the Watergate comparisons he rejects that seem to be sticking.

It was Richard Nixon's White House counsel John Dean who flipped on Nixon and helped bring him down. In Trump's telling, Dean is a villain of the Watergate saga because he told the truth about his boss, the president.

Trump called Dean a "RAT" on Twitter on Sunday and denied the comparison, but The New York Times reported officials in Trump's legal team don't actually know what McGahn might have said before Mueller's team.

Trump's legal team on Monday was trying to clean up an odd declaration by Rudy Giuliani over the weekend that "truth isn't truth" as he sought to explain why Trump shouldn't testify before Mueller because he could get caught in a lie.

"When you tell me that, you know, he should testify because he's going to tell the truth and he shouldn't worry, well, that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth. Not the truth," Giuliani told NBC's Chuck Todd on Sunday morning during "Meet the Press."

By Monday Giuliani was recalibrating on Twitter:

"My statement was not meant as a pontification on moral theology but one referring to the situation where two people make precisely contradictory statements, the classic "he said,she said" puzzle. Sometimes further inquiry can reveal the truth other times it doesn't."

Studying McCarthyism

Joseph McCarthy, a Republican senator from Wisconsin, stands before a map which charts Communist activity in the United States in 1954.

Watergate wasn't the only history Trump was rewriting Sunday, as he tried to paint Mueller as a latter-day Joseph McCarthy, the notorious anti-Communist crusader of the 1950s whose name became a stand-in for government overreach.

Brennan has publicly talked about that vote -- for Gus Hall for president in the 1970s -- but Trump was more concerned with the '50s on Sunday.

"Study the late Joseph McCarthy, because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby! Rigged Witch Hunt!" Trump said on Twitter.

The President may very well have studied McCarthy; in New York in the '70s, Trump was a protege of Roy Cohn, the lawyer who decades earlier helped McCarthy try to root out communists and allege ties to the Soviet Union.

McCarthy's effort, now seen almost universally as a stain on the country, saw him and Cohn run wild as they ruined lives and ginned up the Red Scare, alleging a communist infiltration in the State Department and producing a list of names he said were the culprits. He later held hearings about alleged communist sympathies in the Army. (Stylistically, McCarthy's secret list of communists and the innuendo he used to frighten Americans with a communist conspiracy theory shares more similarities with Trump's allegations of a "deep state" and his growing list of current and former government officials, including Brennan , whose security clearances Trump has either revoked or is reviewing).

Cohn, by the way, later worked with Roger Stone, an early Trump political ally who now figures in the Mueller investigation.

Trump appearing with Roy Cohn, who died in 1986.

Trump's ties to McCarthy are stronger than any comparison of McCarthy to Mueller, who is not a senator trying to use public hearings and reports for political gain, but rather a special counsel who by all accounts is proceeding quietly and methodically.

Verdict nears for former Trump campaign chief

The McCarthy allusion was the latest revisionist history lesson from Trump as the country waits for jurors to finish deliberating in the trial of Trump's former campaign chairman in Alexandria, Virginia, on tax evasion and fraud charges.

Earlier this month, Trump made the unwelcome comparison between that former campaign boss, Paul Manafort, and Al Capone, the infamous mob boss ultimately brought down by the IRS on tax evasion charges.

Meanwhile, it's unclear to everyone but Mueller and his team what they'll ultimately report. And it became clear this weekend, after Trump lashed out following a series of stories in The New York Times about White House counsel McGahn, who Trump says he early on encouraged him to cooperate with Mueller. The Times later wrote -- and a source confirmed to CNN -- that the White House is unclear what information McGahn may have shared with Mueller, a potentially frightening development for Trump, since McGahn could be witness to Trump's alleged efforts to quash quash or minimize the Russian investigation.

Don McGahn in the role of John Dean?

Trump lashed out in a two-part Twitter statement Sunday, mixing a Watergate allusion with another McCarthy one.

"The failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel, he must be a John Dean type 'RAT.' But I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn't have to. I have nothing to hide......

"....and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close. So many lives have been ruined over nothing - McCarthyism at its WORST! Yet Mueller & his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - Media is even worse!"

Speaking later Sunday on CNN, Dean responded, saying he'd be honored to be on a list of Trump's enemies, and pointing out that Trump should worry about McGahn's testimony, since McGahn's role is to be the White House's lawyer, not Trump's.

"You've got to put this in a larger perspective," Dean said on CNN. "McGahn is doing what he should do, and what was resolved after Watergate as to who is the client of the White House counsel. The client was presumed when I was there to be Nixon. The president. Today, it's clear that it is not the case. It's the Office of the President he represents, and there can be real differences between the incumbent president and the office itself, and McGahn represents the office."

While he held the same White House title as McGahn, Dean is also featuring in another of the dramas that swirls around Trump and the current and former aides talking to authorities.

The attorney representing former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen told Politico he has been consulting Dean on a regular basis. Cohen, facing his own legal problems, has indicated he could cooperate with Mueller.

"I certainly don't want to raise expectations that Mr. Cohen has anything like the level of deep involvement and detailed knowledge that John Dean had in the Nixon White House as a witness to Nixon's crimes, but I did see some similarities and wanted to learn from what John went through," Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis told Politico.

Dean cooperated with prosecutors and ultimately testified about Nixon's misdeeds at the Watergate hearings and served four months in prison for his own obstruction of justice. It's not clear what role if any McGahn might play in Mueller's final report, whatever it might say, despite mounting pressure from Giuliani to get it out of the way before November elections.

Another historical note, since Trump is conflating Watergate and McCarthyism, is that a key ally of McCarthy's before his efforts went fully off the rails was none other than Richard Nixon.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct Paul Manafort's former title. He was Donald Trump's campaign chairman.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) For all of Donald Trump's struggles in his first 19 months as President, there's one thing he's proven particularly adept at: Picking winners in contested GOP primaries.

That run of winners continued Tuesday night when voters went to the polls in Arizona and Florida

The most obvious example of Trump's power within the party is in the Florida governor's race, where, late last year, he tweeted favorably about the candidacy of Rep. Ron DeSantis, who was seen as a heavy underdog to state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam in the primary.

"Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida," Trump tweeted just days before Christmas . "He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!"

__label__world Hong Kong (CNN) The Pentagon kicked off the world's largest naval war games last week, the biennial, month-long Rim of the Pacific exercises, known as RIMPAC, bringing together 46 ships and submarines, 200 aircraft and 25,000 troops from 25 nations.

Missing from that contingent is China, which was disinvited from RIMPAC over its militarization of islands in the South China Sea.

But as ships were arriving in Hawaii for RIMPAC, China was completing naval exercises of its own, with a series of live-fire naval drills off Taiwan that began on June 17.

That the two sets of exercises overlap only serves to reinforce the differences between the two super powers, as both countries vie for military influence in the Pacific.

RIMPAC is about "building relationships," US military leaders said at a press conference in Hawaii on Thursday, pointing out Indo-Pacific nations making first-time or upgraded contributions to the exercises, including Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines, which all have claims in the South China Sea.

"We work together, build relationships here, so later on ... it's hard to turn down a friend," Vice Adm. John Alexander, commander of the US Navy's 3rd Fleet, told the Pearl Harbor gathering marking the beginning of the games.

And RIMPAC shows the US Navy is better at making friends than its Chinese counterpart, analysts say.

"China's absence means that it loses an opportunity to ... establish professional and potentially personal relationships with its regional and global naval counterparts," said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.

Beijing does not host any naval exercises on the scope of RIMPAC, Schuster said.

"There is a bit of the 'I'm the popular kid on the block' approach to all this," said Peter Layton, visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia, pointing out that the US Navy knows how to show off its and its partners' capabilities.

Among the planned RIMPAC missions are new missile demonstrations, amphibious exercises, mine clearing and anti-piracy exercises, according to the US Navy.

Expect all to be well publicized with tweets, photos and videos and postings on the RIMPAC Facebook page

"It highlights in graphic media detail lasting a month that navies want to exercise with the US Navy," Layton said.

And the presence of the South China Sea nations at RIMPAC shows loyalties in the region remain very much in play, said Layton.

Making friends and extending influence

Washington has periodically sent warships within boundaries declared by China around disputed islands, but those so-called "freedom of navigation operations" have not been joined by other Southeast Asian navies.

RIMPAC gives those Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) a chance to show "passive support" for the US position, Layton said.

Republic of Singapore Navy guided-missile frigate RSS Tenacious arrives at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in preparation for RIMPAC 2018. Singapore is one of seven ASEAN nations participating in the exercises.

The 10 ASEAN nations include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. All but Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar are at RIMPAC.

"ASEAN states might not be willing to sail with the US Navy through the disputed waters but they are keen to exercise with the US Navy and show solidarity that way," Layton said.

"Vietnam for the first time attending this year's exercise is significant in that regard. The Philippines involvement similarly indicates they wish to hedge their bets and remind China they have other options," he said.

Broad coalition

Outside of Southeast Asia, the US is giving important roles to other allies.

Canadian and Japanese admirals will be in the Nos. 2 and 3 overall command positions and Australian and Chilean commanders will the maritime and air components respectively.

Members of the Canadian 2nd Battalion Royal 22e Régiment wait to take off during loading and offloading drills for the MV-22 Osprey during Rim of the Pacific exercises on Thursday.

"The trust built in RIMPAC will pay dividends when we all respond together to crises that may arise," Adm. John Aquilino, the commander of the US Pacific Fleet, said at Pearl Harbor on Thursday.

China, meanwhile, sent a flotilla of warships for a week of "real combat training" around Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory but has been a self-governed, democratic island since 1949 following a civil war on the Chinese mainland.

Beijing said the combat exercises were "directed at separatist elements advocating "Taiwan independence," according to a report from the state-run Xinhua news service.

The Chinese military said two warships from its Eastern Theater Command spearheaded the exercises -- with added units from air and coastal defense forces -- in the Taitung Strait, the Bashi Strait and the Taiwan Strait, according to Xinhua.

Highlighting that the exercises were conducted by the Eastern Theater Command, formed during a Chinese military reorganization in 2016, was important, according to Schuster, the former US Navy officer now a Hawaii Pacific University professor.

"It means the PLA Navy and the joint command structure are getting better, more capable and they want Taiwan and the United States to know it," he said.

UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters take part in Taiwan drills simulating Chinese attacks in June 2018.

The exercises came while US Defense Secretary James Mattis, who had pulled China's RIMPAC invitation in early June, visited leaders in Beijing.

They included President Xi Jinping, who made his position on the South China Sea clear.

"Our stance is steadfast and clear-cut when it comes to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity," Xi said, according to state media, adding that " any inch of territory passed down from ancestors cannot be lost while we want nothing from others."

Alternative alliances

Beijing isn't showing any envy of RIMPAC either. On Thursday, the Defense Ministry announced its planning naval drills with the 10 ASEAN nations later this year, aiming to "enhance mutual trust, expand exchange and cooperation, and safeguard regional peace and stability," Xinhua reported.

Meanwhile, Layton says for all the US military's talk of building relationships, there's one person who could burn them down during the month of RIMPAC -- Donald Trump.

The US President has meetings with NATO and European Union leaders as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin scheduled for July.

"Donald Trump is widely expected to insult the Europeans and the Canadians, and actively try to damage NATO and the EU, while heaping praise on Putin for Syria and the Ukraine," the Australian analyst said.

"Some EU nations and maybe others may wonder why they are supporting a US exercise in the Pacific," Layton said. "Trump in attacking allies and friends will undo for all participants some of RIMPAC's soft power aspects."
__label__politics (CNN) Democrats now lead Republicans by 52% to 41% in a nationwide generic Congressional ballot according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released Tuesday. The blue lead has increased slightly from eight percentage points in June of this year to an 11 percentage point difference in the most recent poll.

Despite Democrats' advantage on that measure, a plurality (48%) in the same poll believe Republicans will maintain control of Congress after the election, compared with 40% who believe Democrats will gain control.

Among those who favor the Democratic candidate in their district, 64% say they think Democrats will ultimately win control of Congress, while among those backing Republican candidates, 83% think the GOP will maintain control.

Compared to previous elections, 68% of registered voters say they're more enthusiastic to vote in this election than in the past. Registered Democrats and Republicans report being more excited to vote at similar levels, with 70% and 68% saying so, respectively.

However, Democrats have taken a much higher leap in enthusiasm vs. 2016 than Republicans. When CNN last asked the question, in September 2016, only 38% of Democrats said they were "more enthusiastic," while 48% of Republicans said the same. Registered Democrats jumped 32-points since 2016 and Republicans moved 20-points.

__label__world (CNN) In rural areas across northern Bangladesh families are preparing to mark Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest dates on the Muslim calendar.

The holiday, which translates literally as the "sacrifice feast," is intended to be a time of great celebration. In small villages and towns, such as Beraberi some 134 kilometers northwest of Dhaka, residents spent much of the last year hand-rearing goats and cows in anticipation of the annual festivities.

Then the rains began to fall.

As the world's media trains its sights on the tragic events in Texas and Louisiana, another water-driven catastrophe is unfolding in villages like Beraberi throughout Bangladesh and parts of Nepal and India.

There, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) estimates that at least 1,200 have died and more than 41 million people have been affected by monsoon rains and severe flooding as of June this year. The rains are now moving northwest towards Pakistan, where more devastation is expected

At its peak on August 11, the equivalent to almost a week's worth of average rainfall during the summer monsoon season was dumped across parts of Bangladesh in the space of a few hours, according to the country's Meteorological Department, forcing villagers in low-lying northern areas to grab what few possessions they could carry and flee their homes in search of higher ground.

And still the rains keep coming. In Bangladesh alone, floods have so far claimed the lives of 142 people, and impacted over 8.5 million.

In Beraberi, one of numerous island villages know as "chars" dotted along the Jamuna River, entire homes have been washed away, and crops and food supplies -- including livestock -- all but wiped out. When aid workers carrying relief parcels from the IFRC arrived by helicopter earlier this week, villagers described the rains as the "worst in living memory."

"People were fearful they would soon begin to starve," says Corinne Ambler, who was among the IFRC team who visited the village. "They are used to seasonal flooding but nothing to this degree, this is a different level -- for miles around all you can see is water, the flooding has transformed the countryside."

Mother of two, Adere Begum, 34, was at home in the village with her daughters when the flooding began. "The water was up to our knees inside. There were snakes in the water and my children were very scared," said Begum, who lost much of her livestock, including ducks, chickens and cows in the floods.

The IFRC has described the flooding in Bangladesh as the most serious in 40 years. The organization estimates that 700,000 homes have been partially or totally destroyed and up to a third of its terrain -- much of it farmland -- left submerged, raising fears of a coming food shortage, as the country grapples to deal with a shortfall in staple produce.

"This is the season of rice cultivation," Reaz Ahmed, Director General, Bangladesh's Department of Disaster Management told CNN. Almost half of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector , with rice as the single most important product.

According to government estimates, to date a total of 61,877 hectares of cropland, mostly rice, have been "completely damaged," while 531 million hectares have been "partially damaged."

Recent figures from the the Asian Development Bank show that 31.5% of Bangladeshis live below the national poverty line. For many of those in the north of the country, where fragile sustenance farming remains the norm, even the slightest drop in crop production can prove devastating.

In areas where the flood waters are receding the government is advising that farmers return in the hope that some crops can yet be salvaged. "Farmers still have around 20 days to re-cultivate rice plants. The government is providing them seed, saplings and fertilizers," said Ahmed.

But such efforts are complicated by poor infrastructure. In areas north and northwest of the capital Dhaka, where flooding is most acute, a significant number of villages remain entirely cut off, with many major roads and highways inaccessible.

Bangladesh is no stranger to flood related disasters. Much of the country is built on low-lying and flood-prone areas, making it particularly vulnerable to seasonal monsoon rains. In 2007 more than half of Bangladesh was seriously affected by deadly monsoon flooding, leading to over 1,000 deaths, the majority of them children

A report by the World Bank group lists Bangladesh, a densely populated country of 165 million, as among the world's "potential impact hotspots" threatened by "extreme river floods" due to global rise in temperatures.

As of August 31, more than than 51,000 people have been relocated to emergency flood shelters set up by the government, according to Ahmed, though that number is expected to rise as food shortages begin to bite and families seek additional assistance.

The sheer number of displaced people would be a monumental challenge for any government, but in Bangladesh, where as many as 27,000 Rohingya refugees have this week arrived across the border from Myanmar -- joining an estimated 85,000 currently housed in camps -- the situation becomes additionally perilous.

With the country essentially left combating two separate humanitarian crises, aid agencies are appealing for international assistance.

"Providing clean water and sanitation are our major priorities right now. The floodwaters will soon become a breeding ground for deadly diseases such as diarrhea, malaria, dengue and Japanese encephalitis," said Antony Balmain, IFRC's Communications Manager in Asia Pacific. "As we've seen in flood hit parts of Sri Lanka, there is a very real possibility this could yet get much worse."
__label__politics Story highlights Between 1997 and 2017, Congress paid $17 million in settlements

The money comes from a fund set up to handle settlements within the US Treasury

(CNN) Two things have become painfully clear on Capitol Hill this week: Lawmakers and staffers say sexual harassment is "rampant" -- but even members of Congress have no idea just how widespread the problem is.

The controversial and sensitive issue has taken center stage in Congress this week, with female lawmakers making fresh allegations of sexual harassment against unnamed members who are currently in office, and the unveiling of a new bill on Wednesday to change how sexual harassment complaints are reported and resolved. On Thursday, a woman shared her story of being groped and kissed without her consent by Sen. Al Franken in 2006.

So far, there's been little specific data to help illuminate just how pervasive sexual harassment is on Capitol Hill, but one figure has emerged: the total that the Office of Compliance, the office that handles harassment complaints, has paid to victims.

On Thursday, the Office of Compliance released additional information indicating that it has paid victims more than $17 million since its creation in the 1990s. That includes all settlements, not just related to sexual harassment, but also discrimination and other cases.

An OOC spokeswoman said the office was releasing the extra data "due to the interest in the awards and settlement figures." The OOC has come under fire in recent days for what lawmakers and Hill aides alike say are its antiquated policies that do not adequately protect victims who file complaints.

__label__politics (CNN) Senate Republicans sharply pushed back on President Donald Trump's reported demeaning comments about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, with one top GOP senator comparing the President's tirades to a "whining" teenager.

"If the President doesn't like his service, he can look him in the eye and terminate him," Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker told CNN. "Whining is pretty unbecoming of a 13-year-old. But it's very unbecoming of a 71- or 72-year-old President."

Corker, a retiring Tennessee Republican, added that Trump's disdain for institutions like the Justice Department shows his "lack of appreciation for democratic values and institutions," warning he would turn the country into Venezuela "if left to his own accord."

As a retiring Republican, Corker often is a rare voice criticizing a number of the President's controversial statements and actions. But on Tuesday, more Republicans began to speak out about Trump's comments attacking Sessions, which were reported in the book by journalist Bob Woodward. In the book, the President reportedly called the attorney general, who is from Alabama, a "dumb southerner" and "mentally retarded." Trump has for months lashed out at Sessions because he recused himself from overseeing the Russia probe since the former senator served as a top surrogate for the Trump campaign in 2016.

As senators on Tuesday began to digest the new comments, more began to push back.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) As his Environmental Protection Agency delivers its latest blow to environmental regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions, President Donald Trump is heading into the heart of coal country to deliver the good news.

Trump will join supporters in Charleston, West Virginia, for a political rally on Tuesday to celebrate his administration's proposal to allow states to set their own emissions standards for coal-fueled power plants.

The move would reverse Obama administration efforts to combat climate change and marks the fulfillment of a campaign promise at the heart of his appeal in coal-producing states like West Virginia -- an appeal embodied by Trump's 2016 campaign stops in the coal country of West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, where Trump supporters waved "Trump Digs Coal" signs and where the President-to-be donned a coal-mining helmet.

The EPA Tuesday morning formally unveiled the details of its new plan to devolve regulation of coal-fired power plants back to the states, one that is expected to give a boost to the coal industry and increase carbon emissions nationwide.

The move is expected to spark an intense legal battle, with environmental groups already readying legal challenges to the new regulations.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced $113 million in new US investments in the Indo-Pacific region Monday, including $25 million to promote digital connectivity, $50 million for energy projects, and $30 million for infrastructure.

In making the announcement, Pompeo emphasized the US commitment to the region, and to the principles of freedom and openness, implicitly drawing a contrast to China's investment policies under its "One Belt, One Road" plan.

"With American companies, citizens around the world know that what you see is what you get: honest contracts, honest terms, and no need for off-the-books mischief," Pompeo said at an Indo-Pacific Business Forum at the US Chamber of Commerce. "For us the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is not just a law — it is a point of pride. Integrity in businesses practices is an essential pillar of our Indo-Pacific economic vision."

While President Donald Trump has frequently referred to China as a top US economic competitor, Pompeo avoided calling China out by name in his remarks. Still, he frequently sought to frame US companies as the better partners for countries seeking foreign investment.

The US "will never seek domination in the Indo-Pacific," said Pompeo, "and we will oppose any country that does."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The White House is scrambling to fix the confusion and humanitarian concerns unleashed by President Donald Trump's reversal on the separation of parents and children who come across the southern border as undocumented migrants.

Trump's hurried executive order designed to defuse a ballooning political crisis caused its own set of problems, especially because the move did nothing for the 2,300 children already taken from parents who are awaiting prosecution.

A set of legal challenges was also looming for the Trump administration which in one scenario could even allowed end up seeing the separations reapplied.

The chaos meant that Trump's hopes of quelling the political uproar over the separations were dashed. The uncertainty could deepen later Thursday if the House of Representatives fails to pass two Republican immigration bills that could partially alleviate the separations drama.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen responded to a wave of criticism by saying Thursday that the administration was trying to reunite split families.

"We have a plan to do that, as you know we do it on the back end. So a combination of DHS, DOJ, HHS reuniting as quickly as we can," Nielsen told CNN's Tal Kopan.

CNN reported Wednesday that the order did not contain any procedures for how to reunite children now in the care of the federal government with their parents. The agency later walked back the statement but said any further plans to reunite families were still in development.

"I think the intention was to change things (but) I think there is a lot of confusion. Frankly, I think the way the order is drafted is not executable," John Sandweg, a former director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told CNN's Anderson Cooper.

"I was really shocked to see they are not going to unite the kids. I thought the whole point of this was to reunite the kids," he said.

Trump's critics accused him of creating the problem by adopting a "zero-tolerance" policy of prosecuting undocumented migrants which meant brought into play restrictions on children being held in jail with their parents, thereby triggering the separations.

"He created a crisis, he said he solved the crisis. He has not," Democratic House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer told CNN's Kate Bolduan.

Trump unlikely to shift

Immigration was the foundational issue of Trump's 2016 campaign and it forms the essential link between the President and his base. So while his retreat is embarrassing, it's unlikely to signal any softening of his broader stance on undocumented immigrants.

Thursday morning he continued to express his displeasure with current immigration laws and mislead about the state of US immigration courts.

We shouldn't be hiring judges by the thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand, we should be changing our laws, building the Wall, hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2018

"We shouldn't be hiring judges by the thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand, we should be changing our laws, building the Wall, hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password," Trump tweeted.

His own Justice Department is trying to hire a few dozen immigration judges, not thousands, and the move is widely seen across bipartisan lines as a way to expedite hearings and clear a backlog of cases.

The President mentioned the reversal only in passing at a campaign event in Minnesota on Wednesday night.

"Today, I signed an executive order," he said. "We're going to keep families together, but the border is going to be just as tough as it's been."

While the President was campaigning Wednesday night, his critics accused him of solving the problem of separations by simply ordering the locking up of entire families indefinitely.

"When you have the most powerful nation on Earth saying that it is acceptable to detain families indefinitely, you are sending a signal to countries around the world that this is how they can treat immigrants and minorities," said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.

Unlikely odds for legislation passage

Congress could change the dynamic Thursday when the House votes on several bills that include language that would permanently end family separations.

But even if one of the measures passes, its inclusion of elements of Trump's hardline changes to legal immigration policy seems almost certain to kill it in the Senate.

Republican Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told reporters that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen argued that the President's executive order had only bought time for Congress to change the law after a Capitol Hill briefing on Wednesday night.

"She essentially said, 'Look, the President is trying to give Congress a little wiggle room on this but we do need Congress to act,' " Mullin said.

While the political situation is murky, the legal challenges to the executive order may be even more complex.

Under the Trump administration's new policy adopted earlier this year, many people are funneled into the criminal justice system when they cross the border illegally -- and US guidelines mandate at that point that children are separated from their parents.

The executive order lays down new guidelines, requiring families to be kept together in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security.

But that position is almost certain to be challenged in court because of a 1997 consent agreement that stipulates that children can be kept in detention only for 20 days.

That decision could even lead to families being separated again.

"It's absolutely a possibility," Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University professor of law, said on CNN, laying out two possibilities if the administration could not get the consent agreement modified, a scenario he judged as doubtful.

"You reunite the family; a clock is ticking. If it goes beyond 20 days, you either release the entire family, which is similar to the Obama policy that the President wants to change," said Turley. "Or you once again separate the family and send the child into some type of custodial care."
__label__politics (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May appeared to dismiss concerns raised by one of her own cabinet ministers that the UK could leave the European Union without a deal, saying that such a scenario "wouldn't be the end of the world."

May poured cold water on the warnings issued by her finance minister Phillip Hammond after he suggested last week that failure to reach agreement with the EU would have huge economic consequences.

Hammond's comments drew criticism from fellow Conservative party lawmakers following his assertion that GDP could fall and borrowing would increase by £80 billion a year by 2033-34 if Britain fell out on orld Trade Organization terms. Hammond said such a move would have "large fiscal consequences."

British Chancellor Philip Hammond has warned against a "no deal" Brexit.

"Look at what the director of the World Trade Organization has said," May, who is on a trade mission to Africa, told reporters when quizzed about Hammond's remarks. "He said about a no-deal situation that it would not be a walk in the park but it wouldn't be the end of the world."

"What the government is doing is putting in place the preparations such that if we're in that situation we can make a success of it, just as we will make a success of the good deal I believe we're able to get and the good deal we're working to get," she said.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona condemned President Donald Trump's attacks against former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman as "unbecoming," just hours after Trump called the only African-American to have served in a senior role in the White House a "dog."

"This kind of language is unbecoming of a President of the United States," Flake, an Arizona Republican, wrote on Twitter Tuesday. "There is no excuse for it, and Republicans should not be okay with it."

Trump's reference on Tuesday morning to Manigault Newman as a "crazed, crying lowlife" and a "dog" is at best a sharp departure from the language typically employed by Presidents and at worst a reference that traffics in sexual and racial imagery. Trump has long denied being racist and has dismissed a claim made by Manigault Newman that he used a racial slur on the set of "The Apprentice." He's also invoked "dog" to insult non-African-Americans -- including Mitt Romney and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.

Trump's latest attack against Manigault Newman comes amid the release of her tell-all book "Unhinged: An Insider Account of the Trump White House," which contains several unflattering claims against the President and his staff. The White House has denounced Manigault Newman's book as "riddled with lies and false accusations."

Flake, who is not seeking re-election in 2018, has been a frequent critic of the President. Trump has responded in saying that Flake decided not to run again because his career is "toast" and had " zero chance of being elected."

__label__politics (CNN) A year before the Trump administration's "zero-tolerance" policy resulted in more than 2,300 children being separated from their families at the border in a mere five-week period, a ninth-grader in McAllen, Texas, was taken from his mother.

He was riding in a car with friends last spring when the car was pulled over. The teenager, brought illegally to the country by his mother as a baby, was unable to show identification. Police called immigration officials, who arrested the boy and sent him to a shelter for unaccompanied migrant children.

John Doe 2, as he is referred to in current legal filings challenging his detainment, became one of thousands caught in a network of shelters and higher-security facilities that house undocumented minors, now gaining attention as newly separated children have been streaming in.

Immigration attorneys working directly with migrant children say some of these facilities provide the best care they can, given the circumstances. And a huge shelter in Brownsville, Texas, which opened its doors for a media tour last week, appeared to be clean and well-staffed at the time.

But John Doe 2 landed in a far more troubled corner of the system, according to a first-person sworn declaration in a current legal motion against the federal government for unlawful and inappropriate detainment of children. His account is one of dozens describing overloaded and secretive shelters, treatment centers and secure detention facilities for undocumented minors, which at their worst have allegedly been home to neglect, assault and other horrific abuse.

The allegations in these documents, as well as recent facility inspection reports and other lawsuits, range from unsanitary conditions and invasive monitoring of mail and phone calls to unair-conditioned rooms in hot Texas summers and dosing children with cocktails of psychotropic drugs disguised as vitamins. At one facility, children recounted being held down for forcible injections, which medical records show are powerful antipsychotics and sedatives.

This is the system the children who have been separated from their parents are entering. And, even after the executive order Donald Trump signed on Wednesday, presented as a way to end the separation of migrant families, it is the system in which the children already separated and thousands of other undocumented children currently remain.

"There seems to be a level of cruel intent I've never seen before and a real indifference to the well-being of a child," said Holly Cooper, one of the many attorneys challenging the government's detainment of minors. Cooper regularly visits facilities and represents a number of migrant children as co-director of the Immigration Law Clinic at University of California, Davis.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement did not respond to repeated requests for information, and a spokesperson said the agency can't comment on ongoing litigation. But in a press call, officials said that shelters are run by organizations that meet state licensing standards and are staffed by people who are well-equipped to meet the needs of children in their care. The agency also said it is ready to expand capacity as needed to meet the growing demand.

John Doe 2 tells another side of the story. When he tried to run away from the first shelter he was placed in after two months and began acting out, including harming himself and getting into fights, he said he was moved twice -- ending up at a public regional detention center in Virginia, Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center, intended for some of the most dangerous young migrant detainees.

He claims his case manager told him he was transferred there because of "behavioral issues." That assertion is backed up by legal filings from the facility, which say he had been diagnosed with conditions including ADHD, anxiety and intermittent explosive disorder.

His arrival there marked the last time he would breathe fresh air for months, the teenager said in a sworn legal statement in January. He was so upset about being there that he talked back and lashed out at staff, who he said he heard degrading him and other Hispanic children in English, not realizing that he could understand. His defiance led them to hurt and restrain him, he said.

"They will grab my hands and put them behind my back so I can't move. Sometimes they will use pens to poke me in the ribs, sometimes they grab my jaw with their hands," he said in his declaration. "They are bigger than me. Sometimes there will be three or four of them using force against me at the same time. The force used by staff has left bruises on my wrists, on my ribs, and on my shoulder. The doctor here gave me ibuprofen for the pain."

Immigrant children housed at Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center have made grave claims of abuse.

At this same facility, he said, he was sometimes kept in handcuffs and then tied to a chair with a restraint placed over his face with holes so he could breathe. This punishment was described in at least five other declarations from children, including one who said he was left naked, strapped to the chair for more than two days.

In court documents, Shenandoah denied any assault of residents, but it acknowledged that staffers use confinement and restraints when residents fight one another or staff, and it said it uses an "emergency restraint chair" as a last resort for aggressive behavior. "When the emergency chair is utilized, residents are restrained by their arms, legs, and torso, and a spit mask is placed on the resident to prevent staff from being spit upon or bitten," the facility stated. In a statement to CNN, the organization said, "Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center believes the allegations of the complaint to be without merit and looks forward to the opportunity to present evidence that will allow a jury to reach the same conclusion."

John Doe 2 was still in Shenandoah as recently as January, when he gave his declaration. "I'm frustrated about being locked up and I miss my family," he said.

On Thursday, in response to the allegations, Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia announced an investigation of the Shenandoah facility.

The US government doles out around $1 billion to nonprofits and local government agencies each year to house and provide services for detained migrant children, in facilities that range from the repurposed Walmart in Brownsville, Texas, that CNN visited last week to juvenile detention centers. The facilities where they are held are often opaque, not publicizing their locations and blocking journalists or lawmakers from viewing the conditions.

Some children in the system crossed the border alone, often fleeing violence in their home countries. Others arrived with their families and were separated, even before the new policy. Still others, like John Doe 2, have lived in the United States for years but lack citizenship. Regardless of their origins, they all enter the same system.

Immigration attorneys are battling the federal government over the conditions in these facilities, arguing that a high-profile settlement reached in 1997 that dictates how children are treated within the system, known as the Flores agreement, has not been upheld. Some of the allegations precede the Trump administration. Recent filings contain hundreds of pages of firsthand statements detailing abuses from children, medical records, intake paperwork, as well as internal correspondence and debate between attorneys and the federal government. Another, separate class action lawsuit filed in federal court last fall accuses Shenandoah of "unconstitutional conditions that shock the conscience," a claim Shenandoah denies.

Currently, nearly 11,800 children are housed in more than 100 facilities across 17 different states, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is required to take custody of the children within 72 hours of their initial detainment by immigration authorities. With many of these already operating at capacity, the government has been scrambling to find additional beds for children.

It is unclear how many children are currently housed in facilities more restrictive than shelters, but ORR data cited in court filings shows that such facilities received more than 800 admissions in fiscal year 2017.

Experts opposing the child-separation policy, including the American Medical Association and the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, say that even briefly separating and detaining children has been shown to cause long-lasting harm to them.

But at some of these shelters and other facilities, the harm to these children goes far beyond the mere fact of being detained in the first place. Some of the least restrictive facilities have been cited by regulators for problems -- including those run by Southwest Key Programs and BCFS Health and Human Services, two of the largest government grant recipients. And when trauma may cause kids to act out, children can promptly be moved or "stepped up" to more restrictive facilities, where children and their attorneys say they are treated like prisoners. Ultimately, their fate may depend on the facility where the US government decides to place them.

In shelter system, hundreds of 'deficiencies'

Though the worst abuses in the immigrant child detention system have been alleged in higher-security facilities, even the shelters where children begin their stays have seen allegations of neglect, assault, verbal abuse and missing background checks for staff, in a system that is increasingly straining at its seams.

Take, for example, the 26 shelters and higher-security facilities run in Arizona, California and Texas by Austin-based Southwest Key Programs, the largest ORR shelter contractor. This nonprofit has received more than $955 million in federal funding over the past three fiscal years, according to online government spending data. Company CEO and President Juan Sanchez made at least $1.5 million in 2016, according to government filings. That would put him among the five highest-paid nonprofit CEOs in the country that year, according to Charity Watch.

Dr. Juan Sanchez, president and founder of Southwest Key Programs

As recently as early 2017, Southwest Key shelters were mostly under capacity -- enough so that the company laid off workers and closed some shelters in mid-2017. But most of Southwest Key's 16 Texas shelters now operate under month-to-month variances granted by the state to let them hold up to 150% of their original licensed capacity, including the Casa Padre shelter in Brownsville that CNN visited last week.

Those variances have come even as state inspectors have found more than 246 "deficiencies" at Southwest Key's facilities over the past three years. State reports cite at least three cases of under-supervised children harming themselves, including one with plastic cutlery and one by drinking rubbing alcohol. They have cited staff for drunkenness; shoving, using other physical force and belittling children; for keeping kids in unair-conditioned rooms in mid-July at a shelter in El Paso; and in one case for having an "inappropriate relationship" with a child. In one case in a San Benito shelter, "Staff did not take child to the bathroom when he requested and consequently child urinated on himself during class time."

Twenty-three citations involved improper medical treatment. Inspectors cited Southwest Key for giving kids the wrong medications; for failing to give them prescribed medications; for withholding medical care -- for example, making a child with a fractured wrist at the El Presidente shelter in Brownsville wait three days before seeing a doctor -- or inappropriate care, such as vaccinating a pregnant teen at the same shelter.

In all three years, Texas cited Southwest Key for failing to get timely background checks on staffers.

In California and Arizona, shelters are inspected much less frequently. Arizona, which has eight open Southwest Key facilities and three that have been closed, generally only inspects accredited Southwest Key or other ORR-contracted shelters in that state when it receives a complaint, said Arizona Department of Health Services spokeswoman Nicole Capone. One citation of four recorded in that state since 2015 was for improperly restraining children.

One former Southwest Key employee in that state called the lack of supervision problematic.

"The whole time I worked at Estrella del Norte, I saw maybe one person from ORR," and no one from Arizona's oversight agencies, said Antar Davidson, who spent four months as a youth care worker at Southwest Key's shelter in Tucson. He quit on June 12, because, he said, he thought the way Southwest Key operated "was very damaging to the children." He has been outspoken about his experience in the last week since going public in the Los Angeles Times about his concerns, including that low-paid, high-turnover staff was not well equipped to handle the recent surge in distressed children newly separated from their parents.

Antar Davidson

Southwest Key's communications director, Cindy Casares, said all employees receive at least 80 hours of classroom and on-the-job training. She said the company takes deficiencies seriously, carries out internal investigations, and disciplines, fires or retrains employees who violate policy. "Whenever there is a finding of any kind, a corrective action plan is developed and submitted to licensing and implemented in the programs," she said.

Other ORR shelter contractors have a history of violations as well. State officials who inspected shelters operated by San Antonio-based BCFS Health and Human Services cited that nonprofit in 2016 for housing children in substandard conditions that included moldy carpets, rusty bathrooms and exposed nails in a bed. Staff were accused of inappropriate relationships with children in care; of using physical force and, in one case, an employee was found to have kept money sent to a child. This nonprofit will receive roughly $127 million in this fiscal year, according to online government spending data. BCFS could not be reached by phone, and a press release on its website referred all media inquiries to the federal government.

A nonprofit in Virginia, Youth for Tomorrow, has been the subject of state violations at a facility where it hosts migrant children, including findings that the facility hired people without the required education and experience, failed to conduct background checks, and didn't adequately supervise the children in its care. In one case in 2013, a facility neglected to call authorities when a staff member physically restrained a resident; the resident said he was hurt so badly that he couldn't swallow. In a statement to CNN, Youth for Tomorrow said the organization is in compliance with all state regulations and that the citations were "singular events" that "were satisfactorily resolved in a timely and appropriate manner" as required by regulators.

Another nonprofit operator, KidsPeace, has recently been cited by Pennsylvania regulators for its shelters' failure to include crucial information in children's medical records (such as attempted suicide), inappropriate monitoring of phone calls and mail to and from children and inadequate abuse training. KidsPeace said in a statement that it strictly adheres to state laws and that its mission is to "provide hope, help and healing to children in need of care, including those placed with us by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement."

Alleged restraints, assaults and pills known as 'vitamins'

The vast majority of unaccompanied children are held in shelters, but for the hundreds that are escalated to more secure facilities, conditions can be far worse. It can also become even harder to get out.

These places include residential treatment centers for those with severe psychiatric or psychological issues and risk of self-harm, "staff secure facilities" for children who require close supervision, and secure facilities for those who pose a danger to themselves or others or have been charged with committing a crime.

The government says these are a last resort intended to meet the specialized needs of the children and protect others in shelter care. But attorneys suing the federal government argue that many of these children have been moved to these facilities without "the most rudimentary procedural fairness or transparency," which the government denies. Some kids, they assert, should not have been placed in these facilities in the first place. And attorneys say those who do have documented behavioral issues, which are common given the trauma that many of these children have experienced, are only seeing their problems exacerbated by the conditions they endure in these higher-level detention centers.

"While all detainees (adults as well as children) should be treated with dignity and respect, this is especially critical for children and youth because of their inherent vulnerabilities," Gregory Lewis, a psychologist who reviewed the declarations of a number of youth held at Shenandoah, including the Texas teenager, stated in a legal filing. "It is likely that many of these detained youth will never fully recover from their traumatic experiences prior to and during detention."

In the first-person accounts reviewed by CNN, children describe being moved from facility to facility all over the country, often by plane, after being deemed unfit to remain in the shelter where they were originally placed. In multiple declarations, youths describe being awoken in the middle of the night only to end up transported to a new facility -- with no explanation of why they are being moved or opportunity to fight their new placement. And once they are placed in these secure facilities, attorneys say it becomes increasingly difficult to reunite them with family, because their release is contingent on a number of requirements and high-level approvals.

One of the places some of the most troubled children are being sent is the nonprofit Shiloh Treatment Center, located on a rural patch of land in Manvel, Texas. Shiloh has been the subject of controversy for years, with the founder being forced to close a separate facility, Daystar Residential Treatment Center, after a troubling history of abuse and deaths, culminating in a child dying in what was ruled a homicide by asphyxiation due to physical restraint. A local congresswoman called for Shiloh's closure four years ago after the Houston Chronicle documented years of abuse there, yet the government continues to pay millions to the organization.

The Shiloh Treatment Center in Manvel, Texas

Children held at Shiloh have recounted in their legal declarations being held down for injections of drugs to calm them. A 13-year-old from El Salvador described an incident when, after he tried to run away, he was assaulted by staff -- causing him to faint and leaving him with bruises. Then, despite his objections, he was given an injection of a drug "to calm me down." "Before they gave me the injection, I was feeling dizzy and was still having a hard time breathing. I was in a lot of pain with bruises all over, and I did not want the injection," he said.

Many also say they were forced to take pills that staffers called "vitamins," which they say were given to them without their or their parents' consent. Medical records filed as evidence show children were being injected with sedatives and antipsychotics, and that many of the pills they were given were powerful and sometimes addictive psychotropic medications.

An 11-year-old referred to as Maricela in court records said she was taking 10 pills a day, in a statement from late last year, and that she didn't know what they were for. "When I take medicine, I do not have any mood," she said in Spanish. "It is disgusting. I do not like being on this many medications and I have suffered side effects including headaches, loss of appetite and nausea." She said she was afraid to refuse the medication, knowing that her stay at Shiloh could be extended. And she described living in constant fear of staff members after being pulled forcefully out of a bathroom and witnessing them pinning other residents down to receive injections.

"Today, one of the girls was upset and someone was trying to calm her down but then the teacher said don't talk to her, just give her a shot," she said. She had become so sad at Shiloh that she wanted to cut herself, she added, but she hadn't learned how to do it yet.

"I do not feel safe here," said Maricela, who has been moved to an unknown facility but remains detained, according to a nonprofit law firm involved with the Flores motion. "I would rather go back to Honduras and live on the streets than be at Shiloh."

Shiloh, which is licensed to accept children as young as 3 years old and is on track to take in more than $25 million in funding between the 2014 and 2018 fiscal years, according to current government data online, referred CNN to the US government, which wouldn't comment either. A government letter the plaintiffs filed as evidence shows that as of April, 26 children were being housed at Shiloh through the ORR program. In a legal response to the allegations of inappropriate drugging and abuse, officials said the state of Texas carefully monitors the facility for compliance with state laws and guidelines, including those governing the use of prescription medications; that the facility psychiatrists strive to use no more than four psychotropic medications at once; and that consent is required except in emergency situations, when the youth could harm themselves or others.

At Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center, the facility in western Virginia where the Texas teen described being tied to a chair, other teenagers describe being violently restrained, beaten, and discriminated against for being Latino. The facility is facing a class action lawsuit alleging verbal and physical abuse, substandard care, excessive use of solitary confinement and other deficient conditions that result in suffering and even death.

In declarations about their experiences filed in both the class action and the Flores motion, detainees reported being stabbed with a pen, kept in handcuffs, taunted by staff and being deprived of clothing and mattresses. Shenandoah, which government data shows will have received nearly $20 million in funding between the 2014 and 2018 fiscal years, denied the assault of residents in legal filings and said that punitive measures were only used in extreme situations.

Another former detainee -- who spent around three years in ORR custody, including about a year at Shenandoah -- remembered the restraint chair described by the Texas teen. "(Y)ou feel suffocated with the bag on," he said. "(T)hey don't do it in a nice way. They don't explain what they are doing: they just grab the left side of your head and they force it over you. You can't move to resist. The first thing that came to my head when they put it on me was, 'They are going to suffocate me. They are going to kill me.'"

As another child, this one a 15-year-old from Honduras who described being repeatedly assaulted by staff at Shenandoah, plainly stated: "I want us to be treated as human beings."

Teenagers in the Flores documents described other forms of mistreatment across the country in California at Yolo County Juvenile Detention Facility, another secure facility paid by the government to house migrant children. Multiple youth discuss the use of pepper spray, with one teen saying he had been sprayed seven times in his eyes.

One teenager, who fled Guatemala to escape an abusive father and forced child labor, had been in federal custody for almost two years when he gave a sworn declaration in November from Yolo, which he described as "a juvenile jail where we are kept in cells, forced to wear uniforms and treated like criminals."

"The detention center makes me feel like an animal," said the teen. "The conditions at the detention center are terrible." The government, in a letter filed as evidence, said the teenager had psychiatric and behavioral issues.

The facility's own chief probation officer, Brent Cardall, told the Yolo County Board of Supervisors that the detention center could not meet the mental health needs of many of the migrant teens and previously stated in court filings that the government had often failed to provide any corroboration of gang affiliation of some of the supposed gang members sent there. In April, Cardall proposed ending the program for unaccompanied children altogether, saying "it would be in the best interest of the county to terminate this federal contract and end the program." The county supervisors instead voted to discuss reducing the number of migrant children accepted into the facility and requiring youth to have documented reasons for being there.

Yolo, which received more than $6 million in government funding between fiscal years 2014 and 2017, is on track to bring in more than $5 million for the 2018 fiscal year, according to online government data. The county said in a statement to CNN that in the 10 years it has worked with ORR, it has provided all youth with "the care and services they need," though staff are negotiating an increase in funding to meet the teens' needs. County officials also said they are "gravely disturbed" by the forcible separation of families, that no newly separated children have been placed there, and that the county has the ability to reject the placement of youth in its facility if officials don't believe they belong there -- which they have done in the past.

"The county does not, and has no interest in, operating a de facto federal prison for forcibly separated youth," the statement said.

While the conditions and alleged abuse at Shiloh, Yolo and Shenandoah dominate many of these first-person accounts, allegations of mistreatment and prolonged detention at other "stepped-up" facilities have surfaced as well. These have included taunting and physical abuse by staff, punishing children who refuse to take their medication, and claiming complaints about treatment could jeopardize a child's immigration status.

One Honduran teenager, identified as Roberto F., described employees at a "staff secure" Southwest Key facility in Brownsville insulting him and other residents. "There, too, I watched as they grabbed the minors brutally, throwing them to the ground," he said in his statement.

Casares, Southwest Key's director of communications, said in an email that "Southwest Key has a no tolerance policy on abuse," and that any program director aware of such allegations would be required to suspend the employee and report them to the state, to law enforcement and to ORR.

How separated children are joining a troubled system

Government officials have given inconsistent accounts of the precise number of children split from their families since the start of the zero-tolerance policy was announced on May 7. Border Patrol spokesman Brian Hastings said that between May 5 and June 9, agents separated 2,342 children from parents who crossed illegally. That doesn't include minors arriving unaccompanied or minors who arrived at ports of entry with parents seeking asylum. Though government officials have denied they split up families there, the American Civil Liberties Union is suing Homeland Security on behalf of several asylum seekers whose children were taken after they presented themselves legally at ports of entry.

During a tour for reporters of the Casa Padre shelter on June 13, Southwest Key CEO and president Juan Sanchez said that less than 30% of the almost 1,500 boys there, ages 10 to 17, had been separated. On June 19, a Southwest Key spokeswoman said about 10% of the children in its 26 shelters had been separated from their parents. Martin Hinojosa, Southwest Key's director of compliance, noted that the proportion of children separated from their parents is rising.

It's still unclear what the implications will be of Trump's new executive order, in which the President continued to blame Congress for his own administration's recent move to separate families. The executive order declares a goal "to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings." It also declared that the attorney general should prioritize immigration proceedings for detained families.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement didn't respond to multiple requests for comment or for information about where the children taken from their parents so far are now being placed. But attorneys and advocates say they believe it's only a matter of time before some of these newly separated children wind up being moved to some of the higher-security detention and treatment facilities with the worst conditions -- exposing them to more harm and making it harder for them to reunite with their parents.

"That's a significant concern that we have," said Nithya Nathan-Pineau, director of the Detained Children's Program at the Capital Area Immigrants' Rights Coalition. It's only natural for kids in prolonged detention -- and ones who have been separated from their families after harrowing journeys from dangerous homelands -- to have emotional or behavioral challenges, she pointed out.

On the June 13 tour of the massive Casa Padre shelter, Southwest Key's Hinojosa said staffers there move quickly to send boys who demonstrate troublesome behavioral or mental-health issues to higher-security facilities.

"Not a lot of the children detained in El Paso remain in El Paso," said Melissa Lopez, executive director of Diocesan Migrant and Refugee Services in El Paso, Texas. She has dealt with cases of children who she says were wrongly labeled as gang members. Lawyers say such children are often targeted for higher-security placement.

"They often make allegations with little or no proof. They don't have to tell us on what basis the finding was made. ... Our clients don't speak English. They don't understand what's going on. When a child is incorrectly flagged as a gang member, there are serious repercussions for the child and added difficulty for us, as practitioners, in figuring out on what basis the finding was made," she said.

Elissa Steglich, a clinical professor at the University of Texas Immigration Clinic in Austin, said she's seen increasing numbers of children being taken from parents at the border in recent months, and that in almost all cases, "there's no child-welfare rationale to support it."

By separating children needlessly and placing them into a system that can add to the harms they're experiencing, she said, "We've ensured there will be lifelong damage to these children."

__label__world (CNN) An explosion Saturday at a refinery in the town of Vohburg, in Germany's southern Bavaria region, has injured at least eight people and forced about 1,800 residents from their homes.

The blast, which occurred in the early hours, was followed by a fire, a statement from police in Bavaria said.

A fire burns at the site of the refinery in Vohburg early Saturday.

Three of the injured were taken to the hospital with moderate to severe injuries, police said.

About 1,800 people were evacuated from parts of Vohburg and from Irsching, just to the west, and are being sheltered in a local gym, police said. Residents have been instructed to keep windows and doors closed.

Footage from the scene showed thick, dark smoke rising from the refinery site.

1. Florida mass shooting

Two people were killed and 11 injured after a shooting during a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida. Police said the suspect in the shooting, 24-year-old David Katz of Baltimore, Maryland, opened fire on gamers before killing himself. A possible motive in the shooting, which took place at an open-air marketplace along the St. Johns River, hasn't been released.

Survivors of the shooting described a scene of absolute chaos, with people either running from the immediate area or hiding in bathrooms, calling for help. Florida has seen several mass shootings the past couple of years: at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, at the Fort Lauderdale airport , at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. This latest incident is sure to reignite the ever-smoldering gun debate.

2. John McCain

John McCain will be given an honor bestowed on just 30 people in our nation's history. McCain, who died of brain cancer over the weekend, will lie in state at the US Capitol on Friday. It's just one of many ways the "maverick" senator from Arizona will be honored this week . On Saturday, a memorial service will be held at the National Cathedral in Washington, where former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush will deliver eulogies. McCain will be buried the next day at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

Notably absent from the planned memorials will be President Trump. McCain's family didn't want Trump at his funeral, CNN reported back in May. The White House drafted a statement for Trump praising McCain for his heroism and decades of public service, but it was never sent out. brief tweet -- that didn't mention McCain's military or Senate service or include any praise for him -- was all that Trump put out. The exclusion of the President from McCain's funeral plans speaks volumes , says CNN's Stephen Collinson.

3. Pope Francis

Pope Francis' weekend trip to Ireland was already going to be difficult, with the clergy sex abuse scandals swirling around the church. It became even more so after an ex-church official called on Francis to resign for his handling of the cases. Carlo Maria Vigano, a former archbishop and Vatican ambassador to the US, claimed he told Francis about sex abuse allegations against American Cardinal Theodore McCarrick five years ago, but that the Pope did nothing. Francis, during Mass in Dublin yesterday, asked for forgiveness for abuses and told reporters on his flight back to Italy that he wouldn't say "a single word" about Vigano's allegations.

4. Neil Simon

Playwright and screenwriter Neil Simon died over the weekend from pneumonia complications at age 91. To tick through his work is to go through a list of the shining comedic achievements of the past few decades: "Barefoot in the Park." "The Odd Couple." "The Out-of-Towners." Simon's work was so hot for a period during the late 1960s, he had four shows appearing at once on Broadway. Of his more than 30 plays, 13 were made into movies. He received 16 Tony nominations and won best play three times. He also earned four Oscar nominations, a Pulitzer Prize and the Mark Twain Prize. Perhaps his greatest honor is the Broadway theater named for him; he was the only living person to have received such recognition.

5. Alcohol study

Think you're protecting your health because you're a light-to-moderate drinker? Think again. A new study says no amount of alcohol is safe for your overall health. The study, from the journal The Lancet, says alcohol was the leading risk factor for disease and premature death in men and women between 15-49 worldwide in 2016. That's almost one in 10 deaths. And for all ages, alcohol was responsible for nearly 3 million deaths. Those deaths include alcohol-related cancer and cardiovascular diseases; intentional injuries, such as violence and self-harm; and unintentional injuries, such as drowning, traffic wrecks and fires.

__label__world (CNN) At least 324 people have died in the Indian state of Kerala since the start of monsoon season in late May, officials said Friday.

In just the past 10 days, flash floods and landslides have killed 164 people in the southern state, authorities said earlier Friday, as torrential monsoon rains continued to batter Kerala. Half of those deaths have occurred in the past three days, State Relief Commissioner P.H. Kurian told CNN.

The flooding is the worst Kerala has experienced in nearly a century.

The death toll has steadily risen over the past week as rescue workers scramble to reach thousands of people stranded by floodwater. The army, navy and coast guard have been sent in to assist, and fisherman have been asked to help with rescue efforts.

Thirteen of Kerala's 14 districts remain under a red alert, the highest warning level issued during emergencies in India, according to the country's National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), which has deployed 53 teams across the state.

__label__politics (CNN) A racist robocall targeted Andrew Gillum days after the Tallahassee mayor won the Democratic nomination in the Florida governor's race, giving him a shot at becoming the state's first black chief executive.

The 78-second prerecorded message, obtained by CNN, is narrated by a man speaking in a caricature of a black dialect with cartoonish jungle noises in the background. It ends with a disclaimer that it was paid for by The Road to Power, a white supremacist and anti-Semitic video podcast hosted by Scott Rhodes of Idaho.

The phone message went to Florida residents, but it's unclear how many received it. The Tallahassee Democrat first reported the robocall.

The same neo-Nazi group recently sponsored robocalls in Iowa, using Mollie Tibbetts' death to attack Latinos and promote white supremacy, the Des Moines Register reported. There have also been reports the group previously targeted local officials in California, Virginia and Washington state.

The Gillum campaign's communications director, Geoff Burgan, said the robocall is "reprehensible -- and could only have come from someone with intentions to fuel hatred and seek publicity."

__label__politics (CNN) Florida's high-stakes gubernatorial race will be fought between a progressive Democrat vying to become the state's first black chief executive and a Republican congressman closely allied with President Donald Trump.

In a late primary season shocker, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum defeated the front-runner, former Rep. Gwen Graham, who had led in the polls for most of the campaign. He emerged from a field of five competitive candidates, in which he was the only non-millionaire and only supporter of "Medicare for all" single-payer health care, to become the state's first black gubernatorial nominee.

"The point has never been lost on me that my name on the ballot is simply a vessel, is simply the name,' Gillum told a raucous crowd of supporters in Tallahassee on Tuesday night. "But what is underneath that name are all the issues that we care so deeply about."

Gillum will face Republican nominee Rep. Ron DeSantis, setting up a clear ideological battle between progressive Democrats and a Trump-styled Republican in a major presidential battleground state.

In a statement Tuesday night, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , who campaigned for Gillum in Florida earlier this month, cheered the 39-year-old's "vision" and cast him as an emerging leader in the broader progressive movement.

__label__politics (CNN) Melania Trump announced Monday afternoon that she will go to Africa in October for her first major solo trip since becoming first lady.

"This will be my first time traveling to Africa and I am excited to educate myself on the issues facing children throughout the continent, while also learning about its rich culture and history," the first lady said in a statement. "We are a global society and I believe it is through open dialogue and the exchanging of ideas that we have a real opportunity to learn from one another."

The Associated Press was first to report her travel plans.

In January, CNN reported that President Donald Trump , at a closed-door meeting at the White House, bemoaned the influx of immigrants from what he deemed "s---hole countries" in Africa, according to sources.

The first lady's trip to Africa -- where she plans to visit several countries, to be announced in coming weeks -- will take place more than a year after her first solo international trip, which was to Toronto. Last September she attended the Invictus Games there, an athletic event hosted by Britain's Prince Harry.

__label__politics Trump's persona -- in politics, business and life -- relies on his self-image as the guy who calls the shots, closes deals and forces others to react to the shock moves of a master narrative weaver.

But as a legal web closes around the President, he's in a far weaker position than he would like, a situation especially underlined by the bombshell revelations that White House counsel Donald McGahn has spent 30 hours in interviews with special counsel Robert Mueller.

Trump reacted to a media frenzy over the McGahn revelations in characteristic fashion: by launching a new Twitter assault on Mueller, taking new shots at his new nemesis John Brennan and diverting attention with newsy comments on the Federal Reserve.

But sources told CNN on Monday that the President was unsettled that he didn't know the full extent of McGahn's testimony and had remained agitated through the weekend, believing the latest developments made him look weak.

McGahn's conversations with Mueller are not the only drama that is leaving Trump waiting on events, rather than dictating them.

Prosecutors and jurors over whom he has little control, the legal exposure of some of his top former associates and the surprising constraints of the most powerful job in the world and those who serve him are leaving him -- for once -- struggling to control his own story.

Trump is on tenterhooks, for instance, as a jury -- now entering its fourth day of deliberations -- weighs tax and fraud charges that could send Paul Manafort, his onetime campaign chairman, to jail for life.

New reports on Sunday that Michael Cohen is close to being charged in his own multimillion-dollar alleged fraud case ignited fresh speculation over whether the President's former personal lawyer could do a deal with prosecutors to testify against his former top client.

Then there is his duel with Mueller himself, who may be the most inscrutable, immovable foe Trump has ever faced.

The President has often raised fears that he could try to have Mueller removed or otherwise interfere with his investigation. But the consequences of derailing a criminal probe into the conduct of his own campaign would cause a crisis of governance in Washington and could so shift the political terrain that even Republicans who have given the President a free pass could be forced to confront him.

Still, on Monday Trump was still mulling the idea of a shock move -- or at least he wanted the special counsel, his own supporters and other Americans to think he might try something unthinkable.

"I've decided to stay out. Now, I don't have to stay out, as you know. I can go in and I could ... do whatever, I could run it if I want," Trump told Reuters in an interview, speaking about the Mueller investigation.

Trying to get back in control

After the McGahn news detonated, Trump -- as he often does when apparently caught off guard -- took pains to create an impression that he was in control.

He tweeted on Sunday that he had engineered McGahn's testimony because he had nothing to hide and rejected commentary that the White House counsel may have turned on him.

Of course, the President could be completely genuine in his comments if he has done nothing wrong. But many legal analysts saw the new details over the length and extent of McGahn's discussions with Mueller as a serious development that could have all sorts of implications down the road.

"I think the White House should be very concerned about it," CNN Legal Analyst Ross Garber said.

"The notion that the White House counsel -- the senior lawyer for the presidency -- was in cooperation with federal investigators and that the President and the chief of staff and others around the President don't know what he said -- that is troubling."

Powerless to do much else, Trump fired off wild tweeting sprees, in deflection mode, accusing Mueller of perpetrating McCarthyism and taking new swipes at Brennan.

"He won't sue!" Trump predicted in a tweet that branded Brennan "the worst CIA Director in our country's history," days after stripping him of his security clearance.

And on Monday the President tweeted: "Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel (sic), only with my approval, for purposes of transparency. Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone ... looking for trouble."

But it's becoming clear that Trump's immediate and ultimate destiny cannot be dictated by a tweet storm or by taking vengeance against an enemy like Brennan -- a tried and trusted tactic in a political arsenal that often relies on elevating and then dismembering a foil.

Other than wielding pre-emptive pardons for former aides that could ignite a constitutional showdown or launching purges of top judicial authorities handling various cases that are drawing him into a deeper legal morass, there is not much the President can do to help himself.

That's partly down to Mueller.

For all his increasingly poisonous insults, claims by his lawyer Rudy Giuliani that the special counsel is "panicking" and the assault by his allies in conservative media, Trump has failed to draw the tight-lipped special counsel into the kind of confrontation that favors him.

And for all Giuliani's demands for Mueller to release his "report" and the political jockeying by Trump's legal team over a potential interview of the President by the special counsel, the taciturn investigator appears to hold all the cards.

No one, least of all the President, can be sure exactly what Mueller knows about key issues like the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, the events that led up to the departure of indicted former national security adviser Michael Flynn or obstruction of justice allegations.

And given the tight clamp the special counsel has imposed on his probe, it is anyone's guess whether Mueller will file a report, what it will say and when he might make his conclusions public.

While Trump's team appears to be trying to make the probe a midterm election rallying call for his political base, it's also unclear whether the special counsel will make any new indictments, issue a subpoena for the President's testimony or take any other significant steps before November.

All that is a serious disadvantage for Trump's legal and political team as it games out a possible defense.

Not so powerful after all

As a zealous litigant during his business career, Trump was used to having lawyers ready to jump at his barked commands.

But he's found that things are different for a president, a reality underscored by the McGahn episode.

Because McGahn serves as White House counsel, his primary duty is not limiting Trump's legal liabilities but to the office of the presidency itself, a distinction that has left some experts wondering why the President did not invoke executive privilege to delay or limit McGahn's testimony.

Even then, there might not have been much Trump could have done, given the realities of McGahn's role and the fact that he is not the President's personal attorney.

"He works for the people of the United States, and there is a very limited scope to the confidentiality of his discussions with the President, especially when they involve conduct that might be legitimately the subject of criminal investigation," Paul Rosenzweig, a former senior counsel to Bill Clinton independent counsel Kenneth Starr, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin.

"He simply has that obligation as a servant of the American people who works for us, in effect."

Trump's frustration over the constraints of his role and the obligations of those who serve him has long simmered in his relationship with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Trump has repeatedly slammed the former Alabama senator for recusing himself from the Russia probe; in other words, protecting not the President but his duty to justice and good governance.

It may not be much longer before Trump feels the same way about McGahn.

The President is also all but powerless in another legal drama that has huge implications.

Like the rest of Washington, he was back in a waiting game as the jury in the Manafort trial in Alexandria, Virginia, slogged through a third day of deliberations Monday. Should it return a guilty verdict, it would hand a first, significant victory to Mueller's team and deal a symbolic blow to Trump, offering new evidence to critics who say he surrounded himself with corrupt characters from his former life.

The President, despite repeated warnings from his cheerleaders on Fox News opinion shows that the Manafort trial has nothing to do with him, has shown by a string of tweets that he is watching the trial closely.

But he cannot do much more than hope that it turns out well for Manafort, though on Friday he did call the trial "very sad" and his former campaign chairman "a very good person" in comments seen by some legal experts as an effort to influence a jury that was not sequestered.

Until the jury returns its verdict, the depth of Cohen's legal woes becomes clear and the inscrutable Mueller makes a significant move, Trump can only wait. And tweet.

He is going to have to get used to not being in control.
__label__world (CNN) China's first domestically built aircraft carrier began sea trials on Sunday, a historic step in the country's mission to build a navy capable of rivaling the world's leading maritime powers.

The new aircraft carrier, temporarily named Type 001A, sailed out at around 7 a.m. in Dalian, in the northeast province of Liaoning, according to reports in Chinese state media.

The 50,000-tonne ship will become the country's second aircraft carrier, and the first to be entirely built and designed inside of China, when it joins the navy sometime before 2020.

The carrier's maiden sea trial follows a speech given by Chinese President Xi Jinping on April 12, in which he announced plans to build a "world-class" navy under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party.

China's first carrier, the Liaoning, a retrofitted Soviet-era vessel bought from the Ukraine, was hailed as the fulfillment of a "70-year dream" of the Chinese nation when it launched to much celebration in 2012.

But experts said while the new aircraft carrier will dramatically boost China's military power in the Asia region, its technology was still outdated and lagged far behind the world's naval superpower, the United States.

"This is, in and of itself, not designed to be some frontal challenge to US power in the Asia Pacific, because it simply isn't in the class of America's aircraft carriers," Sam Roggeveen, senior fellow at Sydney's Lowy Institute, told CNN.

Chinese workers labor on the deck of China's first domestically built aircraft carrier, the Type 001A, at the shipyard in Dalian on 16 April.

Bigger and better

China's second aircraft carrier will be "modernized" compared to its first, experts said, with a design that's bigger and heavier to allow it to carry more planes.

The basic design for the new aircraft carrier is clearly modeled heavily on the Liaoning, including the signature ski-jump inclination at the front from which aircraft lift off.

The ship, which is roughly 315 meters (1,033 ft) in length and 75 meters (246 ft) wide, uses conventional rather than nuclear propulsion, and is believed to displace 50,000 tonnes, according to reports in state media.

Speaking to CNN, RAND Corporation senior international defense research analyst Timothy Heath described the design as generally easier to build and to operate aircraft from.

But expert analysis of pictures and satellite images of the new China-built vessel reveals it has been altered in subtle ways, possibly allowing it to accommodate up to eight additional aircraft.

By comparison, the Liaoning is thought to currently carry around 30 warplanes, including fixed wing aircraft and helicopters.

According to Peter Layton, visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute, the Liaoning was intended to act as more of a training vessel, whereas the new ship is likely to be deployed in combat missions, positioning China alongside a select number of countries with global naval capabilities, including Russia, France, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

As of this year, the United States Navy fields 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, more than any other nation in the world.

The US ships feature "catapult" technology, in which a gear attached to a steam-powered piston or an electromagnetic rail gets aircraft up to flight speed as they leave the deck.

Aircraft launched by catapults can get airborne and with greater quantities of fuel and ammunition, giving them an advantage over Chinese planes, which rely on their own power when lifting off from the Liaoning's ski-jump.

China's sole aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, arrives in Hong Kong waters on July 7, 2017.

Still more sea trials needed

Once an aircraft carrier passes its sea trials, that doesn't mean it's ready for combat. Although the type 001A has successfully left the ship yard, plenty of problems can, and most likely will, arise.

In late 2017, the United Kingdom's new aircraft carrier, the HMS Queen Elizabeth, embarrassingly sprung a leak during sea trials and needed repairs.

In the United States, the USS Gerald R Ford, the US Navy's newest carrier and the most expensive warship ever built at $13 billion, has a host of problems.

The Ford was commissioned into the fleet in July 2017, however, a January 2018 report from the Pentagon's Operational Test and Evaluation Office says the 100,000-ton warship is plagued with troubles in critical systems, including its catapults that launch planes, the arresting gear which catches them upon landing, and its radar.

Those deficiencies "make the ship more vulnerable to attack, or create limitations during routine operations," the report said.

Other problems are more mundane, but show just how many things have to be ironed out in a new warship: The test office report says the Ford is expected to be short of spaces for its crew to sleep.

China's second aircraft carrier was launched at a ceremony on April 26, 2017

Future of the Chinese navy

China may still be a long way from presenting a global challenge to the US Navy, but as a regional power its military program is moving fast.

With a military budget in 2018 of $175 billion dollars, up 8% on the year before , the Chinese military is pushing ahead rapidly with its modernization drive.

Between 2010 and 2017, the Chinese Navy increased its complement of ships from 210 to 320, Boston College professor of political science Robert Ross told CNN, including another 18 in 2016 alone.

By comparison, the active US fleet currently sits at approximately 272 ships, he said.

Meanwhile, the PLA has begun work on its third aircraft carrier, according to the South China Morning Post , which is rumored to employ a more advanced launch system different from the ski-jump.

"The US Navy and the capability for the US Navy will still be superior to the Chinese Navy in 10 years, but the size of the Chinese fleet will be larger and they'll have closed the gap in technology and training," Ross said.

China has made no secret of its desire to build a modern, "blue-water" navy which could operate around the world.

"If you look at China's acquisitions of facilities in the Indian Ocean and in Eastern Africa, they're quickly developing the capability to maintain a naval presence in distant waters," Ross said.

Still, the main focus of the PLA Navy in the near future is expected to be dominating the waters around the Chinese mainland, including the South China Sea.

China is fortifying islands in the region with facilities that could host military aircraft, creating what some experts have called "unsinkable aircraft carriers."

Last week, US intelligence assessed that there is a high probability the Chinese military had deployed anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles to three artificial islands there during recent military drills.

Compared to the rest of the Asia region, Ross said, only Japan can currently equal the Chinese navy and even then they probably only had about five years before they too would be surpassed.
__label__world Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) At the Ayaklı borsa -- or standing currency exchange in old Istanbul -- seasoned traders still ply their trade on their feet as they have for centuries. They say they have not seen such volatility since 2001, when Turkey faced its last major currency crisis.

Those at Ayaklı borsa described August 11 as "Black Friday," after a tweet by US President Donald Trump triggered a new round of tariffs on Turkish aluminum and steel, which sent the Turkish lira reeling. From their vantage point at the standing exchange, the lira's battle is far from over.

"As long as the tension with America continues to be high and Turkey has limited cash reserves, the dollar is open to rise," veteran currency trader Adnan Kapikaya told CNN in the midst of the noisy calls to place orders.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is seen arriving at the NATO Summit in Brussels last month.

Kapikaya is referring to the high-profile spat between Trump and Turkey's long-serving leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The lira has been caught in the crossfire.

__label__world Jerusalem (CNN) Israel on Saturday praised the United States' decision to end funding for the UN agency responsible for providing education, health care and other services to Palestinian refugees, while Palestinian officials said the move threatened peace in the region.

"Israel welcomes the American decision," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement. "It's worth transferring the money to other organizations which will use the money for the benefit of the population and not for the perpetuation of refugees."

Israel has long complained that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) serves to sustain the conflict, because it underpins the "right to return" of Palestinian refugees, a right that Israel rejects.

The head of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) delegation to the United States, Husam Zomlot, accused the Trump administration of reneging on its international commitment and doing Israel's bidding.

"By endorsing the most extreme Israeli narrative on all issues including the rights of more than five million Palestinian refugees, the US administration has lost its status as peacemaker and is damaging not only an already volatile situation, but the prospects for future peace in the Middle East," Zomlot said in a statement.

__label__politics (CNN) A number of Democrats running for the House have shunned Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi -- but they may have to thank her for their seats if they win this fall.

Internal documents obtained by CNN show that the California Democrat remains a fundraising juggernaut for House Democrats as they battle to pick up the 23 seats they need to retake the House majority for the first time since the GOP won control of the chamber in the 2010 midterms.

Through June, Pelosi had raised an eye-popping $83 million for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for the 2018 election cycle, more than double the next closest Democrat, according to an internal list for the group charged with electing more Democrats to the US House of Representatives. A source briefed on the matter said that through July she had raised nearly $91 million for the party committee, which is spending big in hotly contested races including where Democratic candidates are running away from Pelosi.

Despite facing more opposition from Democrats than any other time in her career, Pelosi's fundraising strength remains her biggest asset -- a clear sign why she continues to maintain a hold atop her caucus. If Democrats retake the House in November, Pelosi is certain to use that appeal to try to convince even her skeptics to give her another opportunity to take the speaker's gavel.

Yet Democrats running in Republican-leaning districts are wary of being tied too closely to her -- even though her fundraising is certain to help bankroll DCCC ad campaigns in their districts.

In Kansas, Democratic US House candidate Paul Davis demanded TV stations pull down a GOP attack ad that accuses him of having a campaign "bankrolled" by Pelosi and other House Democrats and says a "vote for Paul Davis is a vote for Nancy Pelosi."

"I've stated since day one of my candidacy that I will not support Nancy Pelosi for leader or speaker if elected," Davis asserted.

But Davis is a part of the DCCC's "red-to-blue" program, races for seats identified by the party committee that could flip from Republican control to the Democrats, and the committee is poised to spend on the airwaves in that race to defeat Republican Lynn Jenkins. About one-third of the 67 candidates in the red-to-blue program have said they wouldn't vote for Pelosi for speaker; a total of 35 Democratic candidates who have won their primaries have said they would not vote for Pelosi as speaker, according to a CNN tally.

The Davis campaign didn't respond to a request for comment about Pelosi's fundraising.

The June fundraising list -- which was obtained from a source outside of the DCCC and is the most recent list provided to members of the caucus -- pertains strictly to money raised for the party committee, candidates in the red-to-blue program and vulnerable incumbents in the party's so-called "Frontline" program. It doesn't include numbers that members raised for other Democratic candidates. The fundraising goals are set by the committee based on the members' respective positions, with Democrats in leadership spots and with prime seats on House panels expected to bring in bigger bucks.

Pelosi's office declined to comment, as did DCCC officials.

"The DCCC doesn't comment on internal documents," said Meredith Kelly, a spokeswoman for the committee.

Fundraising numbers detail shortfalls and big earners

The internal DCCC list also offers clues to how individual lawmakers are performing for the party committee -- particularly those ambitious members looking for spots at the leadership table. Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, who is running to be vice chairwoman of the House Democratic Caucus next year, had doubled her fundraising goal through June, raising $1.1 million, mostly for vulnerable incumbents and those in the red-to-blue program -- while transferring an additional $300,000 to the DCCC.

The second biggest fundraiser is Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, chairman of the DCCC, who has pulled in $35 million for House candidates, including $2 million for Democrats in tough races.

Other potential Pelosi successors have raised seven figures for their party but far less than the leader, with House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland pulling in $3 million and Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the assistant Democratic leader, helping pull in $3.7 million -- each exceeding his goal. Other prominent Democrats, like Reps. Adam Schiff of California and Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, have far exceeded their goals, with each pulling in roughly $2.1 million for the committee.

Yet the list also reveals members who have fallen well short of their goals. Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who challenged Pelosi for the House Democratic leader position last year and has suggested he may run against her again next year, had fallen well short of his goals through June.

Ryan had raised just $60,000 and had transferred just $5,000 to the DCCC through June, far short of his $250,000 goal. He had given nothing for the vulnerable incumbents in the Frontline program and the candidates in the red-to-blue program. Of Pelosi's haul, she had raised $3.3 million through June and nearly $4 million for the Frontline and red-to-blue candidates through July.

Michael Zetts, a spokesperson for Ryan, defended his boss' efforts, saying he's donated more than $165,000 to 105 Democratic candidates, local parties and progressive groups this cycle.

"Ryan has tirelessly traveled the country campaigning directly on behalf of our candidates," Zetts said. "We have 83 days left in this election, and Ryan plans to continue to help Democrats both financially and on the ground in their districts. But at the end of the day, as we have seen time and time again, we can have all the money in the world, but it doesn't buy you elections. Our candidates and our message matter more than money."

Another prominent Democrat -- the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Foorida -- had transferred just $2,500 of her dues to the party committee through June, despite having a $300,000 goal. A Wasserman Schultz campaign official said she has now transferred $35,000 in dues to the committee, while raising just over $372,000 -- still short of her $500,000 goal in that category.

Kevin Gerson, a spokesperson for the congresswoman, said she "expects to meet the fundraising goals set by the caucus." He added that she is helping nearly two dozen candidates in Florida and other states, "while vastly outraising all of her opponents in a general election that she refuses to take for granted."

Other prominent Democrats also haven't pulled their weight.

Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who is positioned to lead the House Financial Services Committee if Democrats take the House, has transferred just $20,000 to the committee despite having a $500,000 goal. Even though President Donald Trump has derisively referred to her as the true Democratic leader, Waters raised just over $90,000 for the committee, even though she set a $1 million goal, while raising just $5,500 for candidates in the toughest races. A Waters spokesman didn't provide a comment to CNN.

Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard had transferred just $20,000 to the committee out of her campaign accounts, despite having a $125,000 goal -- and raised just $500 separately for the DCCC while providing nothing to the candidates in the most competitive races.

A Gabbard aide said there's a reason she hasn't helped.

"Unfortunately, this cycle the DCCC has chosen to spend money on negative campaigning and mudslinging against progressive Democrats in primary elections, which is something Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard cannot support," said Erika Tsuji, who is Gabbard's political director.

(CNN) Look out Donald Trump, while you're not watching, China is quietly stealing a continent from you . And India may not be far behind.

Currently, the battle for supremacy on the African continent is being fought out between the leaders of Asia's two superpowers -- China and India -- and, for the most part, the United States is nowhere to be seen.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi all but tripped over each other last month crisscrossing the continent on personal goodwill visits

Meanwhile, the President of the African Development Bank had to come hat in hand to Washington, where, a source with knowledge of the situation told me, all he got to see were some officials in the Treasury Department

President Trump has still not visited the continent and has not announced plans to do so.

Why should we care? China and India care deeply. After all, Africa is home to Nigeria -- poised to become the world's third most populous country and all the challenges that poses in terms of more jobs for an increasingly youthful population, not to mention food and infrastructure.

But it's also where critical, strategically essential minerals including lanthanum, cerium and neodymium, essential for the electric cars of the future, are located.

And as Akinwumi Adesina, the President of the African Development Bank, told me this week, "there are 400 million hectares of arable land in the savannas of Africa" that will "determine the future of food in the world."

Not surprisingly, Modi announced in an address to the Ugandan Parliament, the first by a serving Indian Prime Minister, that India would be opening 18 new embassies, "deepen[ing] our partnership and engagement across the vast expanse of Africa."

Xi came with an even grander proposal -- membership in China's mega development project: the Belt and Road initiative, initially involving development of massive land and trading corridors across Eurasia and extending its scope even more broadly. Already, it has loaned some $94 billion to African governments and state-owned companies.

But these Chinese-led initiatives and this push into Africa have only been accompanied by considerable peril and deep challenges to the United States and its interests there.

Public debt in sub-Saharan Africa has soared from 28.5% of gross domestic product in 2012 to 48% of GDP this year, according to the International Monetary Fund , meaning broad swaths of the continent must use large chunks of their output just to service their debt.

All too often, pledged against this debt are the natural resources ranging from oil in Nigeria and Angola to rare minerals in Congo and deeply important geo-strategic locations like Djibouti.

At the same time, two-way trade between the US and Africa has plummeted from roughly $142 million in 2008 to $55 million last year, largely because the US has become increasingly energy self-sufficient, removing the need for African crude oil.

Meanwhile, as China and the US are embarking on a virulent trans-Pacific trade war, China is embedding itself in country after country across Africa, often quite profitably, occasionally quite toxically.

The US maintains Camp Lemonnier with 4,000 personnel stationed in what the Navy describes as "the primary base of operations for US Africa Command in the Horn of Africa."

As it happens, the base is located not far from a massive new billion dollar Doraleh Container Terminal complex that includes roads and a hotel, in addition to the port, all built by Dubai-based DP World, the mammoth owner and operator of ports and related facilities in more than 40 countries . Last year, China opened its first overseas military base right next door.

On February 22, armed Djibouti troops, without any warning, seized control of the DP World facility and claimed it for Djibouti's government.

The London Court of International Arbitration ruled the seizure illegal.

"Before the Chinese arrived, we had no problems here," Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chief efecutive of DP World, told me in an interview. "But as soon as the Chinese moved in, of course, the Chinese basically loaned them more than what they needed—to the point there the government became helpless."

China has failed to take any note of this, while the Djibouti government has said it was simply rewriting the terms of its contract with DP. The London Arbitration Court disagreed and termed it an outright seizure.

Sultan Sulayem paused and continued, "What is killing Africa is the infrastructure is collapsing and the only way to improve it is through public-private partnerships. And now, after Djibouti, who is going to invest?"

Djibouti is hardly the only African nation to be seduced by wbhat would appear to be easy Chinese money that will be difficult if not impossible to repay without selling its patrimony of raw materials at wholesale prices, thereby holding them hostage to or tying them ever closer to the Chinese sphere.

The African Development Bank, Adesina told me, has a number of programs designed to stem this drift away from western-style capitalism. But China's commitments may be simply too large and too seductive.

The US has few such profound ties to Africa. Yet it has become quite clear since the late years of the Obama administration that Africa is where instability can quickly morph into direct attacks on American security. Al Qaeda and ISIS have discovered vast new reservoirs and support in terms of manpower, funding and easy plunder in several African nations.

American troops have begun dying in terrorist incidents, most recently in Niger, where four US soldiers died in an ambush by ISIS.

Yet American interests diverge quite dramatically from China's in many corners of this complex continent. China has little interest in building strong, democratic institutions and states. Its goal is to create dependencies that will advance its own agenda of control and security. So, it is long past time for Trump to pay more than lip service to Africa's needs and undertake a substantive visit to this region where he is losing a vast and potentially quite deadly war.
__label__world (CNN) US whistleblower Chelsea Manning has been refused a visa to enter Australia where she was due to make a series of public appearances, her touring company announced Thursday.

The company, Think Inc., said in a statement it had been notified of the Department of Home Affairs' decision on Wednesday and would be appealing it.

"Think Inc. believes Ms. Manning is entitled to freedom of expression and political opinion which are foundations of a free and democratic society and fundamental human rights," the organization's official statement said.

Her first public engagement was due to be held at the Sydney Opera House on Sunday, her touring company said, before appearances in Melbourne and Brisbane.

Chelsea Manning attends an OUT Magazine event at the Altman Building in New York on November 9, 2017.

Manning was convicted in 2013 of stealing 750,000 pages of sensitive government documents and videos and leaking them to WikiLeaks. She was sentenced to 35 years in prison, but had her sentence commuted by then-President Barack Obama in January 2017.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Transportation Security Administration is considering eliminating passenger screening at more than 150 small and medium-sized airports across the US, according to senior agency officials and internal documents obtained by CNN.

The proposal, if implemented, would mark a major change for air travel in the US, following nearly two decades of TSA presence since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and comes as the Trump administration has stepped up screening measures for items such as laptops and tablets.

Internal documents from a TSA working group say the proposal to cut screening at small and some medium-sized airports serving aircraft with 60 seats or fewer could bring a "small (non-zero) undesirable increase in risk related to additional adversary opportunity."

The internal documents from June and July suggest the move could save $115 million annually, money that could be used to bolster security at larger airports.

According to the proposal, passengers and luggage arriving from these smaller airports would be screened when they arrive at major airports for connecting flights instead of the current practice of joining the already screened population at the larger airport. The high-volume airports have greater capacities and more advanced security measures than smaller locations, the documents say.

CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said it was "stunning that this is even seriously being considered."

"Al Qaeda and ISIS still regard aviation as a priority target -- that includes aircraft where you have fewer than 60 people on board," he said. "They would see that as a way to hit the headlines. They would see that as a way to inflict severe economic damage on the United States. If you have an aircraft of 50 or so people being blown out of the sky there is going to be a great amount of panic and there will indeed be significant economic reverberations, and of course significant loss of life."

"This is so dangerous," a TSA field leader at a large airport said. The individual is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Two senior TSA officials, who asked not to be identified, expressed serious national security concerns over the proposal. They said the idea was explored as far back as 2011 and has been resurrected. The documents referred to some 150 small airports in addition to some midsize ones. TSA currently screens passengers at 440 airports, according to its website.

The working group determined that the policy change would affect about 10,000 passengers who are screened by 1,299 TSA employees daily, which amounts to about 0.5% of the people who fly out of US airports on any given day. The report not list specific airports that could be affected by the policy change.

TSA spokesman Michael Bilello said the study reflects a recurring debate within the agency about its legal requirements.

"This is not a new issue," he said via email. "The regulations which established TSA does not require screening below a certain level, so every year is 'the year' that TSA will reconsider screening." Bilello did not respond to a request for the text of the regulations.

The two TSA senior officials said the level of activity around the proposal this year -- the formation of a working group to conduct a risk and cost analysis -- mean this is more than an annual exercise.

The documents said a TSA working group of 20 people, including a representative of the agency's administrator's office, met on June 21 to examine the potential risks of the policy change. An internal TSA memo dated July 17 from TSA Director of Enterprise Performance and Risk Strategy Jerry Booker to the TSA administrator's chief of staff, Ha Nguyen McNeill, outlines the group's findings. It contains no formal recommendation.

Small airport security issues

The concept of rolling back security at regional airports recalls the coordinated attacks that brought the TSA into existence.

Two of the September 11 attackers first flew from an airport in Portland, Maine, to Boston before boarding American Airlines flight 11, forcing entry to the cockpit and steering it into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. While Portland's airport likely would not be included in the proposal because of its volume of passengers, the 9/11 attackers perceived the airport to be less secure because of its relatively small size.

The proposal asserts that small aircraft would not be "attractive" to terrorists. The documents conclude that attacks with small aircraft would not as attractive a "payoff" because "the potential for loss of life" would be lower than terrorists could achieve with larger planes.

Juliette Kayyem, who was an assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs at the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, said small planes could still be weaponized to cause major loss of life.

"People, weapons, dangerous goods and what's boarding the plane are all potential risks," said Kayyem, a CNN analyst. "TSA is falling into the trap that this is just about terror. A gun could be brought on board too."

Shift from earlier administration rhetoric, policy

The proposal under consideration by TSA is different from the agency's current approach to screening passengers.

Since TSA's inception in 2001, the trend has mostly been toward more enhanced security measures, including limiting gels and liquids in carry-on bags, requiring more advanced screening and directing passengers to remove shoes and belts for screening.

In June 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly announced a laptop ban from carry-ons affecting nearly 280 airports in more than 100 countries.

"Terrorists want to bring down aircraft to instill fear, disrupt our economies and undermine our way of life," Kelly said . "And it works, which is why they still see aviation as the crown jewel target."

He continued, "The threat has not diminished. In fact, I am concerned that we are seeing renewed interest on the part of terrorist groups to go after the aviation sector -- from bombing aircraft to attacking airports on the ground."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump amplified his heated immigration rhetoric on Tuesday, accusing Democrats of wanting migrants to "infest our country" and turning a speech on the economy into an angry tirade defending his harsh stance.

It was a reflection of Trump's growing frustration that the family separation crisis roiling his administration has led to accusations of child abuse and heartlessness. Privately, Trump has insisted he is right to push forward with a practice that has drawn outcry from across the political spectrum.

In a morning tweet, Trump used language evoking images of pests, not human beings, when describing migrants approaching the US border.

"Democrats are the problem," he wrote. "They don't care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13. They can't win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!" he wrote.

Democrats are the problem. They don't care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13. They can't win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!

Later, he declared during remarks at a hotel that he had no choice but to remove children from their parents at the border.

"When you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally, which should happen, you have to take the children away," he said. "Now, we don't have to prosecute them, but then we're not prosecuting them for coming in illegally. That's not good."

It was a defiant stance amid growing outrage at the family separations. Democrats and some Republicans have decried the practice as cruel, citing images of children being detained inside chain-link cages, some erected inside empty box stores.

But Trump and his aides have staunchly insisted they have no choice, instead blaming Democrats for not supporting legislation that would allow the practice to end.

That's a false claim; The family separations are a result of the administration's "no tolerance" immigration policy. But Trump reiterated the accusation on Tuesday.

Speaking at the small business event in Washington, the President said the separation policy is "a result of Democrat supported loopholes in our federal laws" that he said could be easily changed.

"These are crippling loopholes that cause family separation, which we don't want," Trump said.

At the same time, the President appeared to suggest the practice could act as a deterrent for future migrants considering entering the US with their children.

"We want a great country. We want a country with heart. But when people come up, they have to know they can't get in," he said. "Otherwise it's never going to stop."

And he declared the US needs to be secured, whether or not that seems politically palatable.

"You have to stand for something and you have to stand for safety and security of our country. We can't let people pour in," he said. "Maybe it's politically correct or maybe it's not. We've got to stop separation of the families, but politically correct or not, we have a country that needs security, that needs safety, that has to be protected."

The President's entrenchment amid a loud uproar comes amid a developing humanitarian -- and political -- crisis on the United States' border with Mexico, where at least 2,000 children have been separated from their parents as a result of the administration's policy.

Last month, the administration publicly announced its decision to charge every adult caught crossing the border illegally with federal crimes, as opposed to referring those with children mainly to immigration courts, as previous administrations did.

Because the government is charging the parents in the criminal justice system, children are separated from them with no clear procedure for their reunification aside from hotlines the parents can call to try to track their children down.

In the past weeks, heartbreaking images and audio of children crying for their parents have captured the nation's attention as lawmakers seek to find a solution to end the separations and the White House doubles down on its insistence that it is simply enforcing the law.

On Tuesday, Trump is due to meet with congressional Republicans to discuss options for immigration legislation that might bring the practice to an end. But a path forward is unclear, and Trump himself suggested on Tuesday he'd likely make changes to whatever is passed.

"We have one chance to get it right. We might as well get it right, or let's just keep it going," he said.

White House and congressional officials said Trump was referring to family separation language that GOP leadership plans to add to a compromise immigration bill when he referenced making "changes" to the legislation.

Trump's hardline immigration rhetoric was a central piece of his campaign rallying cries, beginning with his campaign announcement speech in June 2015.

"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best ... They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people," Trump said at the time.

On Tuesday, he revived his assertion that some countries are not sending their "best," and threatened to withdraw US aid.

"When countries abuse us by sending people up -- not their best -- we're not going to give any more aid to those countries," he said. "Why should we?"
__label__world (CNN) After weeks of relative calm, a weekly protest at the Israel-Gaza border turned deadly Friday when Israeli forces answered arson attacks by firing on demonstrators, killing two Palestinian teenagers, Palestinian and Israeli authorities said.

Thousands had gathered at several locations along the Gaza fence, the Israel Defense Forces said, when incendiary balloons were launched toward Israel. The IDF also said some protestors hurled rocks and burning tires in the direction of its soldiers. The soldiers responded with live fire and riot dispersal tactics, according to the IDF.

Bilal Mustafa Khafaja, 17, was killed Friday, and Ahmed Misbah Abu Tayour, 16, died later, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

The regular Friday protests, which have taken place since March 30, began as the "Great march of Return" by organizers who say their aim is to highlight Palestinians' right to return to land lost to Israeli 70 years ago in the Arab-Israeli War.

The Palestinian Ministry of Health reports 179 previous Palestinian deaths since the weekly demonstrations began, with more than 19,000 injured. One Israeli has died and 37 have been injured, according to the ministry.

__label__politics (CNN) A federal district judge who was appointed by President Donald Trump has upheld Robert Mueller's appointment and constitutional authority in the special counsel's case against Russian social media propagandists.

Judge Dabney Friedrich, who serves at the trial-court level in DC federal court, said Concord Management and Consulting could not have its case tossed on constitutional grounds. The Russian company accused of backing a social media effort to sway voters against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton claimed Mueller didn't have power to bring the case because he was not appointment by the President and confirmed by Congress. Mueller was appointed under the authority of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has broad power as the acting head of the Justice Department for the 2016 election probe.

"The appointment does not violate core separation-of-powers principles. Nor has the Special Counsel exceeded his authority under the appointment order by investigating and prosecuting Concord," Friedrich wrote in an opinion published Monday morning. She was one of the first judges Trump placed into a federal court position.

Friedrich cited opinions by three other federal judges -- Amy Berman Jackson, who oversees Paul Manafort's criminal foreign lobbying case; T.S. Ellis, who oversees Manafort's financial fraud case; and DC District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell -- to back up her decision.

All three judges also denied requests to invalidate Mueller's authority, with Howell writing as recently as late July that a witness subpoenaed to turn over documents and to testify before the grand jury about Roger Stone would have to. That witness, Andrew Miller, has been held in contempt of the court and now may appeal.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Former California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger took another jab at President Donald Trump on Thursday, following news that the administration plans to revoke a signature Obama-era environmental regulation.

"For 48 years -- since one of my heroes, then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, requested it -- California has had a waiver from the federal government to clean our own air," Schwarzenegger tweeted Thursday. "If the President thinks he can win this fight, he's out of his mind."

The Trump administration wants to freeze a rule mandating that automakers work to make cars substantially more fuel efficient. It called its plan a "50-state fuel economy and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standard for passenger cars and light trucks."

The administration also proposed a withdrawal of California's Clean Air Act pre-emption waiver. California and about a dozen states follow its rules account for about a third of all the passenger vehicles sold in the United States.

In his tweet, Schwarzenegger described the proposal as a "stupid, fake-conservative policy announcement that no one asked for."
__label__politics (CNN) The Trump administration will hold back more than 100,000 pages of documents related to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's service because the White House and the Department of Justice have determined they are protected by constitutional privilege, according to a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee.

William Burck, a lawyer charged by former President George W. Bush with reviewing the documents housed in the presidential library, disclosed the exemptions i n a letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Friday . Burck explained that, in all, he received just under 664,000 pages of documents and that Bush had directed him to "proceed expeditiously" and "err as much as appropriate on the side of transparency and disclosure."

Burck said he has given the committee "every reviewable" document that he received except those that fell into exemptions that included "presidential records protected by constitutional privilege."

The disclosure comes days before Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, which are slated to begin Tuesday, and intensifies a battle between Grassley, who says he has produced a record number of documents, and Senate democrats who question the review being led by lawyers for the Trump administration and Bush. Democratic senators argue that Grassley is refusing to produce documents from Kavanaugh's years serving as staff secretary in the White House from 2003 to 2006.

Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer called the decision to withhold the documents a "Friday night document massacre."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Don McGahn will leave his job as White House counsel this fall following Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation.

The departure of a key member of Trump's legal team comes as special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation continues to consume much of the President's focus amid questions of potential obstruction of justice into the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

"White House Counsel Don McGahn will be leaving his position in the fall, shortly after the confirmation (hopefully) of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. I have worked with Don for a long time and truly appreciate his service!" Trump tweeted.

Sources close to the White House said earlier this month that McGahn was likely to leave his White House post after Kavanaugh is confirmed.

McGahn's standing in the White House has been the subject of much speculation following the disclosure earlier this month that he has cooperated extensively with Mueller's probe, participating in several interviews spanning 30 hours over the last nine months. The conversations have unnerved Trump, who didn't know the full extent of McGahn's discussions, two people familiar with his thinking have said.

Emmet Flood, who now directs the Russia legal strategy from inside the White House, is a potential replacement, CNN reported last week. McGahn fought to bring Flood onto the team and likes him very much, a source close to the White House said.

The news of McGahn's eventual departure comes amid the advancement of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, which is set to start in less than a week and last three or four days, according to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley.

Tumultuous tenure in White House

JUST WATCHED Haberman talks McGahn and Trump relationship Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Haberman talks McGahn and Trump relationship 01:17

McGahn leaves his White House post after serving as White House counsel through the tumultuous first 18 months of Trump's presidency, steering the White House's handling of the Russia investigation and responding internally to the President's mercurial moods as the investigation ballooned.

His departure marks the latest of the handful of top aides who worked on the Trump campaign before joining the White House. McGahn served as the Trump campaign's top attorney throughout the GOP primary and 2016 presidential election, becoming a trusted adviser to the future president in the process.

He immediately faced controversy in his earliest days at the White House, beginning with acting Attorney General Sally Yates' warning to McGahn that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn could be blackmailed by Russia and that he had likely lied to Vice President Mike Pence. Flynn was forced to resign after reports revealed Yates' warning to McGahn about Flynn's conduct.

As the Justice Department and congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election heated up, McGahn found himself increasingly at the center of Trump's and the White House's response to the investigation.

And when Attorney General Jeff Sessions faced pressure to recuse himself, Trump enlisted McGahn to urge Sessions not to take that step. Sessions eventually did recuse himself, giving his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, the ultimate authority to appoint a special counsel.

But for McGahn, the President's order to fire Mueller was a bridge too far -- with the White House counsel refusing to follow through on the order, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. The New York Times first reported Trump's move to fire Mueller and McGahn's refusal to carry out the order.

The slew of incidents involving the President and McGahn amid the Russia investigation made the White House counsel an important witness in Mueller's investigation.

Before joining the Trump campaign and the White House, McGahn worked at the powerful DC law firm Jones Day and previously served as a commissioner on the Federal Election Commission.
__label__politics (CNN) Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth gave birth to a baby girl Monday, her office announced, the first US senator to do so while in office.

"Bryan, Abigail and I couldn't be happier to welcome little Maile Pearl as the newest addition to our family and we're deeply honored that our good friend Senator (Daniel) Akaka was able to bless her name for us -- his help in naming both of our daughters means he will always be with us," Duckworth said in her office's statement.

Duckworth had her first child in 2014, when she was serving in the House of Representatives.

An aide close to Duckworth told CNN she's doing well and taking 12 weeks to bond with her new daughter and take care of her family. She's staying in Washington, DC, for her maternity leave and is available to vote as needed.

When she gave birth to her first daughter, she took her maternity leave at her home in Chicago, but this time she and her and her husband decided that she would give birth in the DC area in case she needs to vote, the aide said.

__label__politics (CNN) The playbook, by now, is familiar. Faced with a negative story -- or stories -- President Donald Trump uses his Twitter feed to float a conspiracy theory of some sort designed to distract and deflect.

On Tuesday, after weathering a self-inflicted wound caused by his unwillingness to acknowledge in any meaningful way the death of the late Sen. John McCain, Trump took to Twitter at 5:24 a.m. to send this message

"Google search results for 'Trump News' shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% of results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!"

So. The President of the United States is alleging a broad-scale conspiracy to filter news by the largest search engine in the world. His "evidence"? That when he types "Trump News" into Google, it produces "only the viewing/reporting of "Fake News Media."

Her conclusion:

"I expected to see some skewing of the results based on my extensive experience with Google, but I was not prepared for the blatant prioritization of left-leaning and anti-Trump media outlets. Looking at the first page of search results, I discovered that CNN was the big winner, scoring two of the first ten results. Other left-leaning sites that appeared on the first page were CBS, The Atlantic, CNBC, The New Yorker, Politico, Reuters, and USA Today (the last two outlets on this list could arguably be considered more centrist than the others).

"Not a single right-leaning site appeared on the first page of search results."

I replicated this same search for "Trump News." Here's what my first page of results looked like:

The first story was by ABC News, the second by Fox, the third by CNBC. According to the Attkisson model, that's two liberal publications and one conservative one.

There's a few problems here -- with both the PJ Media piece and the Attkisson media chart on which it's based.

First, Attkisson's "media bias" chart is not exactly an objective measure of journalistic fairness and integrity. Every major mainstream media outlet in the country -- from CNN to The New York Times to The Washington Post to Bloomberg is cast as left-leaning. Infowars, Alex Jones' conspiracy website, is placed in the center-right. Some conservatives will agree. I'm not going to convince them. But, if you believe that InfoWars has the same editorial processes to get something published as The Washington Post, I can guarantee you that you are wrong.

Second, Bolyard herself makes clear how Google's search engine works -- and how that has zero to do with a publication's ideology. She writes:

"Google is secretive about its algorithm, although the company does say that a variety of factors — around 200 of them, according to Google — go into how pages are ranked. In fact, a whole science has developed — called search engine optimization (SEO) — that purports to help sites become more visible in Google search results. Factors such as the relevance of the topic, the design of the website, internal and external links, and the way articles are written and formatted all can affect a site's Google traffic. Google is constantly tweaking their algorithm, and a website's traffic prospects can rise or fall depending on the changes. PJ Media's Google search traffic, for example, dropped precipitously after a May 2017 algorithm change. We have yet to recover the lost traffic. Other conservative sites have reported similar drops in traffic."

What Bolyard is suggesting is that because we don't know the algorithm that Google uses to populate its "News" tab, it's possible that they could be purposely editing out conservative sites. Because we can't rule it out, then no one can say what she's suggesting isn't true.

(I'd point you to lots and lots of smart pieces about how the Google News algorithm works -- and why it has very little to do with ideology.)

This is the essence of all conspiracy theories: You can't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am wrong, so I just might be right! The best conspiracy theories are perfect machines in that regard; any attempt to debunk them will a) necessarily come up short because definitive proof cannot and will not exist and b) the very act of attempting to debunk will be seen as a surefire sign you are in on the conspiracy!

A Google spokesperson responded Tuesday to Trump's tweet, saying in a statement: "When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds. Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology."

The statement continues: "Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment."

What's remarkable is that even in Bolyard's attempt to prove her point, she provides an insight that fundamentally undermines it. "I performed the search a multiple times using different computers (registered to different users) and Google returned similar results," she writes. "While not scientific, the results suggest a pattern of bias against right-leaning content."

... While not scientific.

That's like saying, "I'm not a doctor and have no medical training, but I am pretty sure you are going to die in the next week." Thanks for your opinion but, like, it's just an opinion. And not an expert opinion. Or one with, you know, science or methodology behind it.

What the President of the United States is peddling to his 54 million Twitter followers, then, is an anecdote hung on a flawed analysis of media partisanship. The conclusions Bolyard's piece draws are entirely based on what she believed going into her "investigation." If every major media outlet in the country is biased, and Google uses the size of media outlets and the frequency they are cited as sources in its search algorithm (and its does!), then voila, all searches conducted via Google are biased.

Like I said: Conspiracy theories are so pervasive because many are simply impossible to prove false. Which, of course, doesn't make them true.

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump pardoned two men on Tuesday who were involved in a dispute with federal authorities over federal land usage that sparked the takeover of a wildlife refuge in Oregon.

Dwight Hammond Jr. and his son Steven Hammond were granted executive grants of clemency by Trump, according to a White House statement. The father-son duo are cattle ranchers and were convicted in 2012 of committing arson on federal lands in Oregon.

"Justice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond, both of whom are entirely deserving of these Grants of Executive Clemency," the statement read.

The Trump White House took aim at the Obama administration as well, adding that it filed an "overzealous appeal" that led to the two men's five-year prison sentence: "This was unjust."

Dwight Hammond has served approximately three years in prison, and his son Steven has served four years, according to the White House.

__label__world (CNN) Just consider this incomplete précis of the past six days.

The Taliban stormed into the strategic city of Ghazni on Friday , ultimately killing hundreds over at least four days of intense urban fighting and undermining the Afghan security plan of focusing on keeping population centers safe.

On Tuesday night, 39 soldiers died in Baghlan province when the Taliban overran their base. And 17 troops were also killed when their base in Faryab was also overrun.

On Wednesday, dozens died when a Shia education center was hit by ISIS. Dozens apparently also died when airstrikes hit an insurgent target in Farah.

On Thursday, gunmen attacked a training center for the Afghan intelligence service.

Yet, despite this being the singular foreign policy issue that President Trump has personally delineated a lengthy strategy on , the White House has not appeared dismayed.

When asked, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders did not comment directly on Ghazni. The White House remains "committed to finding a political solution to end the conflict in Afghanistan," she said, and is "going to continue to review and look at the best ways to move forward."

Afghanistan has gone from being a Forgotten war, to the Ignorable one. Look at the list above and ask: exactly what has to happen to cause a sharp intake of breath?

Instead the onus appears to be on the West engineering a justifiable exit, or a discreet winding-down of the war.

An absolutely seminal, but almost unpublicized change happened in US policy over the past months: it has decided it's OK to talk directly to the Taliban.

While there's been no official confirmation, multiple sources have corroborated Taliban claims that they met with a senior US official recently in Doha.

Men carry the coffin of a relative who died in a suicide bombing that targeted a training class in western Kabul, Afghanistan.

Why does this matter? Because the US has sought peace talks with the Taliban for years, yet had one condition: it had to be between the insurgency and the Afghan government, with the US merely as a facilitator. The Taliban's leaders always wanted to talk directly to the "occupier." And now it appears they can.

We have no idea how these talks went, although there are signs there may be more. The major point is that the Taliban insurgents are in a position of strength, both on the battlefield and in the political consciousness of who they see as their adversary: the US and its NATO allies.

Hundreds have died in the past week, in perhaps the worst period of violence I can recall for years. Yet this bloodshed in America's longest war is barely registering on American TV screens.

The Pentagon has limited resources here. Intermittently, it is dragged into fighting the Taliban, as when its advisors helped order airstrikes to repel insurgents in Ghazni.

But there are around 14,000 US troops and some allies' troops still in Afghanistan. The US spends about $5 billion on Afghan security forces each year. Yet the Afghan army and police's main task -- as defined about a decade ago -- of becoming able to secure the country eludes them.

The US military's own figures show that the government controls about two-thirds of the population, a figure that has barely changed in the past year, despite an Afghan government goal of it rising to 80% by the end of 2019.

So where does this leave America's longest war? The Taliban is in its most radical incarnation for years. The al Qaeda-linked Haqqani network has been given the number two military position in its hierarchy.

A man inspects the scene of a suicide bomb attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Wednesday.

The Taliban's leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, let his son carry out a suicide bombing last year in Helmand. The hope that it will choose a peaceful settlement compatible with the West's moderate desires for Afghanistan's women, and its minorities, is remote. But negotiations seem to be more and more urgent to the White House.

President Trump has said that "winning" is the goal, but -- much like his predecessors -- the precise metrics of what that looks like remain vague.

Does a government in which the Taliban has a substantial say -- and a countryside where its fighters roam freely -- constitute an acceptable compromise?

Does the Taliban's regular and at times effective persecution of ISIS -- known as IS-K, Islamic State Khorosan, as it persists -- mean it is a useful anvil upon which to hammer its far more vicious and inhuman rival?

What about parliamentary elections? Due in October, they will prove a reminder of the lofty democratic ideals NATO swung in with, and how President Ashraf Ghani is still technically in a time-limited power-sharing agreement with the man he fought the last presidential election with.

They are both due to face the electorate again in 2019 for another presidential vote, which will struggle to have a cleaner outcome than its two messy predecessors.

Barack Obama and Donald Trump both (eventually) deemed Afghanistan a war worth fighting. Obama threw at it the full range of US military might, under a perhaps self-destructive time limit. Trump applied much less might, with no apparent time limit. But slowly, it appears security erodes in Afghanistan, its once-safe capital now feeling ever more like a front line.

The debate over what next has to address a simple fact: that the US and its NATO allies have had their military surge nearly a decade ago. Another one isn't coming. The Afghan security forces -- dying in record numbers -- are, at the most generous, not winning back lost ground.

There is not an obvious military victory anywhere in sight. Instead the insurgency is metastasizing, giving ISIS a foothold, and the government is nearing surely yet another round of chaotic elections that risks undermining its legitimacy.

The White House is correct to focus on a negotiated settlement, but times have changed. The US and its allies have to be candid that this will not be the "win" on its terms that it hoped for. The Taliban knows it is winning the ear of perception, and that Western patience is as taxed as ever, and fatigue is rife.

Yet the hope for an Afghan people who have -- according to US military figures -- found themselves in the majority living in government-controlled areas, must be that the "win" that is declared doesn't see the insurgency exacting vengeance and control over their homes.

As we edge toward year 18, the West has forgotten why it first went to Afghanistan, is sketchy about why it stayed and is increasingly unsure about what it must do before it ultimately leaves.

__label__politics (CNN) Two leading senators are asserting that President Donald Trump has not focused on the clear threat the Kremlin poses in the 2018 elections, with one Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee contending that Russian hackers may have already targeted most -- if not all -- sitting US senators.

Ratcheting up the push for a more robust US response to Russian interference in the midterms and 2020 elections, Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma and Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are now slated to get a committee vote this month on a bipartisan bill is aimed at shoring up the nation's election system. But the two senators said their plan has run into hurdles for months -- and say the Russian threat is real headed into the midterms.

In a joint interview as the primary season wraps up and with the November midterms less than 100 days away, the senators told CNN Wednesday that there is far more that has to be done -- from the White House on down to the states.

"The intelligence community has been very active on this, the Department of Homeland Security has been active on this," Lankford said. "While the President has been inconsistent in his tweets, and some of the messaging that he's put on it, he's the only one in the government that hasn't been paying attention to this."

Klobuchar added: "There were clearly delays based on things the President was saying that weren't really directing their people to coordinate, they've admitted that under oath. But from the very beginning, Director (Dan) Coats made it clear that Russia has been emboldened and they're getting bolder."

Both lawyers were relatively junior but frequently spotted members of Mueller's corps. Both have worked on court cases that Mueller opened as part of his investigation into Russian interference and coordination with the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential election.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, declined to explain on Thursday what the departures mean for the state of Mueller's office.

Over this summer, as Mueller opened more criminal cases, other Justice Department units including the US Attorney's Office in Washington and the National Security Division have begun to work on the court action, wedging the cases deeper into the Justice Department's portfolio.

Carr said that neither Dickey nor Richardson left the office because of political allegations, the appearance of bias or any other wrongdoing.

Police admitted being unprepared for the scale of the protests, which took place after a 35-year-old man died from injuries sustained in a fight.

Footage posted on social media shows participants clashing with police and shouting "Foreigners get out," "This is our city" and "We are the people," a phrase used 30 years ago to call for the reunification of East and West Germany, but now frequently heard at far-right gatherings to express anti-immigrant sentiment.

In one video, two men are seen chasing after someone they believed was an immigrant.

About 800 people took part in Sunday's protest, police said, with around 50 of them encouraging violence. The demonstration, which took place on the final afternoon of the city's summer festival, was called only a few hours earlier, and police initially did not have enough officers available. Extra officers were called in from the nearby cities of Leipzig and Dresden to deal with the incident.

__label__world Written by Jenni Marsh, CNN

A Tokyo skyscraper is set to become the world's tallest wooden building. Japanese company Sumitomo Forestry says its 1,148-feet-tall timber tower will be completed in 2041, to mark the 350th anniversary of the business that year. The W350 tower will cost an estimated 600 billion yen ($5.6 billion) to build.

The 70-story tower will be a hybrid structure made from 90% wooden materials. A steel vibration-control framework will underpin the design -- an important feature in a city where earthquakes are frequent.

Green balconies will populate the skyscraper's exterior, connecting the building to its environment.

"The aim is to create environmentally-friendly and timber-utilizing cities where (cities) become forests through increased use of wooden architecture for high-rise buildings," the company said in a press release.

The Japanese government is trying to encourage more developers to use wood. In 2010, it passed the Promotion of Use of Wood in Public Buildings Act, which required all government buildings up to three stories high to be constructed with wood, or to utilize wood.

Spreading like wildfire

It isn't only Japan where wooden skyscrapers are putting down roots. Over the past decade, there has been a global explosion of timber towers, either built or proposed, every one seemingly a recorder breaker in some respect.

Canada currently holds the world record for the world's tallest timber tower, at 164 feet tall. The 18-story Brock Commons Tallwood House, a student residence, topped out last year at the University of British Columbia (UBC), in Vancouver, and has been dubbed the world's tallest "plyscraper."

Before it topped out, The Treet in Central Bergen, Norway, was the world's tallest timber. It took that title in 2014 from the 10-story, 104-feet-high Forte residential block, which overlooks Melbourne's Victoria Harbour and was completed in 2012.

Meanwhile, the Oakwood Tower is a proposed joint project by PLP Architecture and Cambridge University's Department of Architecture. It's been called an experiment in pushing the frontiers of building with wood.

The 80-story tower, if given the green light for construction, will be London's first wooden skyscraper. At 1,000 feet tall, it would only be overshadowed in London by The Shard.

Branching out

New types of ultra-strong timber are partly driving the trend for wooden buildings. "There's a whole bunch of new materials made out of wood that are structurally able to build big buildings," says Dr Michael Ramage, of the Center for Natural Material Innovation at Cambridge University.

Cross-laminated timber, for example, sees thin layers of wood placed across one another at right angles, and laminated with fire-resistant glue to create a stronger weave.

But it's bamboo -- a material that has been used in Asian construction for centuries -- that most interests Ramage. With a five-times higher growth rate than wood, but similar mechanical properties, there are 31.4 million hectares of bamboo worldwide, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization.

"We're working on engineered bamboo," says Ramage. "We can take the walls of bamboo tubes, cut them up into rectangles and glue them into big slabs. You get large pieces of what looks like lumber. But it's stronger than timber."

Kevin Flanagan, a partner at PLP architects, adds that in the future he can imagine the industry genetically modifying wood to make it even more conducive to high-rise construction.

London's burning?

Obviously, when it comes to wooden buildings, there's one burning question. Are timber skyscrapers a fire hazard?

Ramage says Oakwood Tower -- an extension of the Barbican Center in Central London -- would exceed Britain's fire standards of regular steel and concrete buildings. His center has been awarded £250,000 ($353,785) from the Engineering Physical Sciences Research Council in the UK to research timber construction techniques, such as fire proofing.

"There is a huge perception problem," says Ramage. "Timber doesn't burn in the way the public imagines. The great fires of London and Chicago were both sparked by very small pieces of wood. Very big pieces of wood are quite hard to set on fire -- they aren't kindling material."

Wood, he says, burns predictably. Therefore, fire engineers can calculate how large a block of wood is needed to provide a protective layer to sustain a building for a certain period of time.

"All buildings over a certain size need to have sprinklers and active fire suppression systems -- irrelevant of whether it's wood, concrete or steel," he adds.

A series of blazes at Dubai skyscrapers in recent years have highlighted that it isn't just timber buildings at risk of catching fire.

Aren't we meant to be saving the rainforest?

The other potential problem with using wood is the depletion of our forests. According to the World Wildlife Organization, up to 58,000 square miles of forest are lost each year -- that's equivalent to 48 football fields every minute.

Forests cover approximately two thirds of Japan, but Sumitomo Forestry says many of the cedar and cypress trees planted after the Second World War, which are now ready for harvesting, are "being left in an unmaintained state." The company argues that increased timber demand will promote better maintenance of forests and encourage communities to ensure their sustainability.

Ramage adds that "Russia has huge timber reserves, largely because we're finally using less paper." Furthermore, he says, wood is, on average, four times lighter than concrete, so transporting it uses less energy.

From the magnificent Tudor timber arches of Westminster Hall in London to the wooden rooftops of the Forbidden City in Beijing, wood has been used to construct some of the world's most beautiful, iconic buildings. And they haven't fallen victim to rot.

With midterm elections looming, he's facing new questions about his fitness for office, and he's hunting a hidden rebel within his own camp.

The President took immediate steps to address the situation on Monday, hitting out at Bob Woodward's new book, which, along with an op-ed by an anonymous senior official in the New York Times, presents a devastating picture of his performance.

"The Woodward book is a Joke - just another assault against me, in a barrage of assaults, using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources..." Trump tweeted.

"Many have already come forward to say the quotes by them, like the book, are fiction. Dems can't stand losing. I'll write the real book!"

Typifying the sense that what would once seem absurd now counts for normality in this White House, Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday offered to take a lie detector test to prove he was not the author of the op-ed which assailed Trump for "half baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless" leadership.

Pence and the President's counselor, Kellyanne Conway, tried to put the spotlight on the motives of the anonymous official, warning that there could be "criminal" dimensions to the op-ed, boosting Trump's calls for a Justice Department investigation.

But the controversy is unlikely to ease in the week ahead. Woodward's new book is due to be published on Tuesday, and the veteran journalist is promoting his damning account of the President's leadership.

"People better wake up to what's going on," Woodward said on CBS's "Sunday Morning" while touting "Fear: Trump in the White House" as a detailed inside account that mirrors the op-ed's claims that a group of senior officials is working to save the nation and the world from Trump's rash decisions.

If the version of events revealed by Woodward and the anonymous official is true, America is facing a deeply dysfunctional presidency and crisis of governance with no parallel in modern history, apart, perhaps, from the paranoid final days of the Nixon administration.

According to these accounts, the President of the United States would appear to be deeply unsuited to his responsibilities, uninterested in the details of policy, lacking knowledge, and in the words of the anonymous senior official, "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective."

Such a state of affairs would leave the country with a leadership void in the Oval Office and compromise the effectiveness of government. It would also tarnish America's image in the world and could offer openings to adversaries if the White House is constantly distracted.

But the idea that there is a core of "adults in the room," as described by the op-ed writer, subverting the President's authority and wielding for themselves the power granted to the commander-in-chief during an election season should also be a troubling one, since it raises questions about the integrity of America's democratic system itself.

The counter punches

Following days in which the White House was in a defensive crouch, Conway and Pence fought back on political talk shows Sunday after sources told CNN the administration had narrowed its suspicions over who wrote the article to a few individuals.

"To the President's point, there could be a national security risk at hand; he doesn't want this person in a meeting where he's discussing China, Russia, North Korea," Conway told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union."

She said there could be a criminal aspect to the writing of the opinion piece -- though she was unable to say exactly how the author might have broken the law when it appears that the act of disloyalty amounted to exercising the right to free expression.

"I have really no idea, nor do you, what else this person has divulged," Conway told Tapper. "I think somebody so cowardly and so conceited would probably go a step further."

On "Fox News Sunday," Pence was asked whether senior officials should take lie detector tests to prove they did not write the explosive opinion piece in the Times.

"I would agree to take it in a heartbeat and submit to any review the administration wanted to do," Pence said.

The Vice President also argued that the author of the Times article was guilty of more than just disloyalty.

"The honorable thing to do here is for this individual to recognize that they are literally violating an oath. If they are that senior administration official, they are violating an oath not to the President, but to the Constitution."

Pence appeared to be arguing that by showing such disloyalty to the President and even whispering about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him, the "resistance" the op-ed writer mentions is subverting the democratic process.

But those who have praised the actions of the op-ed writer, and officials mentioned in Woodward's book who appear to be acting to contain an impulsive President, counter that senior officials may be acting to protect the Constitution itself from Trump's attacks.

Trump's calls for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate the author of the Times article have renewed fears about the President's expansive view of executive power. After all, he is effectively calling for the government's instruments of criminal investigation to be brought to bear against someone who has committed no obvious crime.

"Does this President not understand that the Justice Department is not a tool of his own personal power?" Virginia Sen. Mark Warner asked Sunday on "State of the Union."

Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, meanwhile, warned that the incessant chaos at the White House was distracting from crucial problems.

"I don't have any desire to beat this President up, but it's pretty clear that this White House is a reality-show, soap-opera presidency," Sasse, a frequent Trump critic said on NBC's "Meet the Press."

"What you'd like is the President to not worry so much about the short term of staffing, but the long term of vision-casting for America, pull us together as a people, help us deliberate about where we should go and then build a team of great, big-cause, low-ego people around you," he said.

November is coming

The fresh uproar at the White House and questions about Trump's leadership style and personality could not come at a worse time for Republicans, with less than two months to go before midterm elections in which Democrats hope to cripple his presidency by winning the House of Representatives.

Some pundits are now beginning to wonder if Democrats have a narrow path to victory in the Senate as well.

Any sense of demoralization that sets in amid GOP voters could dampen their turnout in the election, one reason why Trump is stepping up his campaign swings through red states and imploring his loyal base to turn out in record numbers.

One top Trump aide, budget chief Mick Mulvaney, warned behind closed doors on Saturday that even GOP candidates such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could be at risk of losing and were not "likable" enough, The New York Times reported.

Mulvaney made his comments, according to the Times, at a meeting with party donors alongside Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. The Times said a person at the private event provided the paper with an audio recording of Mulvaney's remarks.

Trump however is adamant that there will not be a "blue wave" of Democratic victories, but a Republican tide in November, based on the strong economy and what he claims is the record-breaking performance of his administration.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton said on Monday that the administration does not feel North Korea is living up to its end of an agreement to denuclearize.

The comments from Bolton came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been stressing the process will take time, revealing a possible split within the administration over how to handle Pyongyang.

"We're waiting for the North Koreans to begin the process of denuclearization, which they committed to in Singapore and which they've not yet done," Bolton told CNN the same day.

Bolton also stressed in the CNN interview that Trump had been willing to have a dialogue with North Korea and likened the US approach to North Korea with its pressure on Iran.

"Maximum pressure on both governments to give up their pursuit of deliverable nuclear weapons, but a willingness to talk to their leaders to see if there's a way out," Bolton said.

__label__world Story highlights In March of last year, it was announced that polio had been eradicated in India

Photographer Elena del Estal couldn't help but wonder about those already living with the disease

(CNN) Imagine sitting on a dusty, busy street in New Delhi, crowded with vendors and people running quickly about the market. A woman's lapis-colored sari swishes past you in the golden-colored dusk. You've been here since morning.

A tourist extends a hand with a crumpled paper bill. You try to lift your hand to accept, but you can't. The muscles are paralyzed, and your mind can't command them to move. You use your knee to balance your arm and grasp the rupee. Then you use your foot to pick up your bag and head home for the day.

This is everyday life for Bipin Kumar. Kumar, known as BK, contracted polio as a child, and he has learned to adapt to how he moves and lives. Kumar has no brothers or father to provide for him, so he moved to New Delhi 10 years ago to pursue the only means of income he could -- begging on the streets.

Photographer Elena del Estal was in India last year when the World Health Organization announced that polio had officially been eradicated from the country. It had been exactly three years since the last contracted case. Del Estal was fascinated by this. She couldn't help but wonder about those already living with the crippling effects of this horrible disease.

Photographer Elena del Estal

She traveled to a small village near Kolkata to meet a little girl who was India's last case of polio. This gave her the inspiration to begin a long-term project on those suffering in a country that's now "polio-free."

__label__world (CNN) Seeing a rainbow often fills people with a sense of joy, regardless of whether it is their first or 19th time witnessing the colorful creation.

Rainbow Gatherings -- annual events that take place throughout the world -- encompass a vibrant mixture of the environment and people to produce a similar feeling of excitement.

Photographer Matjaz Krivic's "Somewhere Under the Rainbow" series was shot over 19 years at Rainbow Gatherings in various countries. According to Krivic, the meaning behind the name of the events originates from an ancient Hopi Native American prophecy about "Rainbow Warriors."

Rainbow Gatherings involve a temporary community of people who meet to share their similar ideals -- peace, harmony, freedom and respect. Those participating in the gatherings collectively refer to themselves as a "Rainbow Family."

The community, which welcomes a wide spectrum of ages, comes together to embrace nature and establish an alternative space away from society's popular culture of consumerism, materialism and mass media.

Photographer Matjaz Krivic

Those who attend are not required to pay any form of money, not even for food, and the gatherings do not have rigid structures of dominance nor one specific leader. Instead, Rainbow Gatherings are essentially idealistic movements driven by the convergence of its community's beliefs in a more equitable society and its people's love and tolerance for one another.

"The magic hat goes around and you put money if you have or if you want," Krivic said. "(But) nobody needs to pay for the food. Everybody is welcome to go and eat there."

Krivic says that Rainbow Gatherings also tend to take place in regions of the world that "need to be healed" after having experienced devastating conflicts. Past gatherings include those held in Serbia, Bosnia and Ukraine.

"I really don't like what's going on in this world. ... There's just so much stuff happening," Krivic said. "You can always go to (Rainbow Gatherings) and stay there and have a nice time, and you don't even have to pay for it. It will be a nice time, nice energy, not aggressive."

One of the most enjoyable aspects about Rainbow Gatherings is the many workshops and activities that are available, where people engage in and learn about everything from yoga and tai chi to meditation and healing techniques.

Another significant part of Rainbow Gatherings is the all-encompassing sound.

"I like the music, I'm an audiophile. I like all sorts of music, but when I go there it's live, it's there," Krivic said. "It's like two guys playing and eventually it's like 50 people playing and the music is just so beautiful."

The first Rainbow Gathering took place in Colorado in 1972, and it is believed to have been organized by youth counterculture "tribes" from Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. Since then, the gatherings have extended to other areas in the United States as well as a number of different countries.

The international gatherings generally take place during the summer, before August's full moon. According to Krivic, the exact locations of some of the Rainbow Gatherings are revealed through hand-drawn maps and presented to those who have attended a gathering in the past.

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

Krivic has had a diverse range of experiences at Rainbow Gatherings, and maintaining a consistent photographic process over the years has enabled him to witness firsthand the growth of his photography. Ever since his first Rainbow Gathering, Krivic has been using the same two film cameras and lenses.

"The gatherings didn't change," Krivic said, "but my photography did change -- a lot. ... I consider photography differently now."

Krivic says a key consideration when taking photos was the use of film cameras as opposed to digital, which he believes do not fit in with the atmosphere of the gatherings. He also had to carefully decide who to photograph.

"I had some friends and I could take photos of them, and then eventually when I was going on and on, it just became like a family," he said. "It's like people that you know for 20 years and you see them every year."

Just as every person sees a rainbow in their own unique way, "Somewhere Under the Rainbow" enables viewers to let their vision roam freely around every corner of the photos, leaving them to cultivate their own perspectives and ripen their imaginations.

In one photo, Krivic takes viewers to Pakistan in 1998, where a man mesmerizes viewers as he stands in pristine blue water holding a mango in his hands.

It's then 2003 in France. Light rays power through colossal trees, illuminating tents and tepees and dosing the atmosphere with warmth.

Viewers later discover a delicate morning hug between a man and woman at last year's Rainbow Gathering in Hungary, with a sunflower softly blooming out of a ukulele.

As for Krivic, he feels that "Somewhere Under the Rainbow" is not finished and will never be.

"I will never complete it. I will always go because I like it," he said. "I will take photos again of friends, and just go on with it."

__label__world (CNN) As he tended to his goats one afternoon in the Ethiopian highlands some 12 centuries ago, a herder named Kaldi noticed that his bleating charges seemed energized after chewing mysterious red berries.

Intrigued by the strange reaction, Kaldi took the berries to a local monastery, where the monks promptly threw them in the fire disapproving of their apparently magical attributes.

As the berries were roasted by the heat, a heavenly aroma spread, and they were used to make the first coffee.

Or so the legend of coffee goes. What is more certain is that Ethiopia, widely regarded as the cradle of coffee, is a nation devoted to the stimulating beverage. The country is Africa's biggest producer and ranks fifth globally. Last year it exported 190,000 tonnes of coffee beans, earning around $700 million, and in 2016 Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa will host the 4th World Coffee Conference, a high-level gathering of global experts.

Saudi Arabia and the United States have not agreed on support for Israel or engagement with Saudi Arabia's regional rival, Iran

Saudi Arabia was a founding member of the Arab League in 1945.

It currently maintains close ties with its neighbor, Bahrain, and helped the Sunni monarchy there put down an Arab Spring uprising in 2011

Religion -

The Wahhabi, or Salafi, branch of Sunni Islam has been closely tied to the Saud family since the 18th century. When the Saud family established the modern country of Saudi Arabia in the 1930s, the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam become the country's official state-sponsored religion.

One of the five pillars of Islam is performing Hajj , by traveling to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, at least once. Approximately two million people a year make the pilgrimage.

Saudi Arabia bans public worship by non-Muslims and severely restricts public displays of religion by non-Wahhabi sect Muslims, including Shiites.

__label__politics Costa Mesa, California (CNN) David Daleiden wanted to show exactly what a 19-week-old aborted fetus, being held in the hands of a medical technician, looked like. The problem was he didn't have that picture. So he went to the Internet, found something close and inserted it into his documentary.

The photo, two cupped hands holding a tiny male fetus, appeared on screen as dramatic music played. Against this backdrop, a medical technician detailed how she was present when an intact 19-week gestated fetus was aborted at a Planned Parenthood clinic and, she says, harvested for tissue samples.

Daleiden's video failed to mention that the photo and the story do not match.

Abortion photo actually stillborn child

The photo was not an aborted fetus at a Planned Parenthood clinic. It was the stillborn child of Alexis Fretz, whose son was stillborn in 2013. Fretz took the photo and posted it on the Internet to memorialize the son she named Walter.

CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.

Without Fretz's knowledge, Daleiden and his two-man documentary group called the Center for Medical Progress plucked that photo from her web page and dropped it into his anti-Planned Parenthood documentary.

"Was it clear?" Fretz asks herself in a CNN interview, "No it was not clear. Was it deceitful? I don't know that."

Daleiden told CNN the fact that the photo is not an actual photo of an aborted fetus makes no difference. He insists the fetus is the same age as the one referred to in his film, and he used it only as an illustration.

Misleading video cited in Republican debate

Daleiden also is being criticized for a second, potentially misleading use of video that has found its way into the Republican presidential campaign. GOP candidate Carly Fiorina cited a portion of the Center for Medical Progress videos in which an intact fetus kicks its left leg and moves an arm shortly after being aborted.

Fiorina described the video during CNN's Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential library on September 16, using the horrific image in her call for an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

In an interview in Southern California earlier this month, Daleiden now admits he has no information on where the video was actually taken. There is no evidence it was taken at a Planned Parenthood clinic.

Daleiden says the image came from an outside source, an anti-abortion group called the Center For Bioethical Reform and he doesn't know its origin beyond that. A spokesman for the group tells CNN it won't disclose the location either, only that the video in question was paid for. Despite its source, Daleiden again insists the video is only used as an illustration of what an intact aborted fetus would look like, not the actual fetus referred to in his film.

Critics call videos heavily edited, discredited

The two examples of misleading pictures and video have allowed Planned Parenthood and its supporters to label the Center for Medical Progress's entire production a fraud.

Dawn Laguens, an executive vice president with Planned Parenthood, repeated the defense the women's health group and its many supporters have been trying to convey since the first of the Center for Medical Progress's nine videos began to be released online.

"All of the tapes and footage David Daleiden has released out into the world has been heavily edited," Laguens told CNN. "And I think pretty thoroughly discredited."

Daleiden insists the two uses of video and photos are not misleading, and says the entire controversy has been manufactured by Planned Parenthood and its "allies in the mainstream media" in order to divert attention from the main point of his documentary: that Planned Parenthood uses aborted fetal tissue as a revenue source.

Planned Parenthood ends payments

The Center for Medical Progress spent several years taping Planned Parenthood employees, medical directors and some of its affiliate partners discussing the technique, costs and reimbursement payments for the harvesting of fetal tissue samples for scientific research.

The filming was done without knowledge of those speaking. In several instances, CMP argues that Planned Parenthood representatives appear to be bargaining, negotiating and detailing the best ways to collect or "harvest" aborted fetuses for maximum financial gain.

In one episode, Dr. Mary Gatter, a medical director for Planed Parenthood, is filmed during a meal discussing her proposal that each tissue sample harvested should fetch a $75 charge.

JUST WATCHED The fight to defund Planned Parenthood Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The fight to defund Planned Parenthood 05:29

Since selling fetal tissue samples is illegal, Planned Parenthood has been quick to label the transactions as reimbursement costs and that they were made only at a tiny fraction of the organization's 700 clinics and affiliates. Planned Parenthood executives continue to claim the videos are heavily edited, taken out of context and deceptive.

But last week Planned Parenthood announced it would no longer accept any reimbursement costs at any of its clinics for the transfer of fetal tissue-samples. In a letter to the National Institutes of Health, Planned Parenthood's president defended her organization and insisted all transactions in the past were legal. But says the new change in policy was being taken "...in order to take away any basis for attacking Planned Parenthood to advance an anti-abortion political agenda."

Contacted after the announcement, Daleiden says the sudden change in policy is an admission that he and his videos were right.

"If the money Planned Parenthood has been receiving for baby body parts were truly legitimate 'reimbursement,' why cancel it?" Daleiden wrote in a statement to CNN. "This proves what the Center for Medical Progress has been saying all along -- Planned Parenthood incurs no actual costs, and the payments for harvested fetal parts have always been an extra profit margin."
__label__politics White, Working-Class and Worried is a CNN partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation - an extensive survey of white, working-class Americans and voters, who form a backbone of the support for Donald Trump. Watch Anderson Cooper 360 and CNN.com for reports throughout the week.

Washington (CNN) The white, working-class Americans who form a backbone of Donald Trump's political support have a split view of Muslim immigrants -- strong majorities believe both that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the threat of terrorism in the United States, but also that most immigrants from those countries are good people.

The data is from a new survey from CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation and is aimed at unveiling the political motivations of the voting bloc that has propelled the GOP nominee.

Threats of terror, both abroad and at home, have repeatedly rolled the race for the White House and the candidates have sought to improve their standing with voters in their responses to the terror attacks in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino, Calif., and most recently after the attacks in New York and New Jersey. Polls generally show that voters trust Trump more than Hillary Clinton to handle terrorism.

Trump's tough talk about combating terrorism and threats abroad, including a plan to erect a wall at the US-Mexico border and his repeated suggestion that profiling as a preventative tactic against terrorism has helped fueled his rise.

While a majority (63%) of white, working-class Americans say immigrants from Muslim countries are generally good people, the same share say that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks.

Members of this group, which exit polls had at around 44% of the US electorate in 2012 though the exact figure is difficult to quantify, also have a more negative view of immigration: nearly half (47%) of whites without a college degree view immigrants as a burden on the country.

Even among those white, working-class voters who view immigrants as a burden, 50% say immigrants from Muslim countries are good people compared with 35% who say they are not.

There is also a partisan divide: White, working-class Democrats are more likely to hold positive views about immigrants from Muslim countries than their white, working-class Republican counterparts. 47% of white Democrats without college degrees say Muslim immigrants increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US compared with 83% of white Republicans with no college degree.

Trump has made his hard line against Muslims a key component of his campaign, and his white, working-class supporters have strong views about the impact of immigrants from Muslim countries. Fifty-three percent of white voters without college degrees who are considering supporting Trump say immigrants from Muslim countries are basically good, but 82% say they increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US.

'Under attack'

More than 6-in-10 white, working-class Americans also say that Christian values are under attack in the United States. That viewpoint is more widespread among older working-class whites than among younger ones. Seventy-three % of white, working class adults 65 and older said Christian values are under attack, while just 41% of working-class adults under the age of 30 said the same.

Trump backers were more likely to say that Christian values were under attack than those who support Clinton. Eighty-one percent of white, working-class voters who would consider supporting him in November said Christian values were under attack, compared to 31% who support Clinton.

Candidate positioning

In the hours following the bombings in New York and New Jersey, Clinton and Trump tussled over who was better qualified to combat terrorism as well as its cause.

Clinton cast herself as the candidate best prepared to combat terrorism and said that her opponent's positions are "not grounded in fact" and "meant to make some kind of demagogic point."

"I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges," the former secretary of state told reporters on Monday, "not engage in a lot of irresponsible, reckless rhetoric."

Trump blamed Clinton and President Barack Obama for failing to keep the country safe and called for profiling to beef up what he sees as currently lackluster anti-terrorism efforts. Instead of treading lightly, Trump said on Fox News Monday morning, the better approach would be to "knock the hell out of 'em."

"Our local police, they know who a lot of these people are," Trump told Fox. "They are afraid to do anything about it, because they don't want to be accused of profiling. And they don't want to be accused of all sorts of things."

Its construction-crane neck, toothpick legs, knocked knees and two-story stature make it an awkwardly lovable favorite of children's book authors and cartoonists. This animal brings an odd sort of wonder to the savannahs of Africa.

But perhaps it's best for us to start imagining a world without the humble giraffe.

It moves up from the category called "least concern."

The reason: a sharp 36% to 40% decline in giraffe populations in recent decades.

In 1985, the group said, there were as many as 163,452 giraffes.

Now the estimate is 97,562.

This puts the giraffe in good company. The elephant, the orangutan, certain bees, coral -- so many of the Earth's mind-blowingly cool creatures face extinction risk these days. If poaching rates continue, some fear African elephants will be extinct in 20 years. Scientists worry coral reefs will mostly vanish by 2050 because humans continue pumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere, warming up the oceans and making them more acidic, and making life hard for coral.

I've spent much of 2016 reporting on the mass extinction event that's brewing all around the world for a CNN series called "Vanishing." That reporting will debut on CNN International on Friday and on this website Monday morning.

If there's one take-away from my travels, it's this: We can't take species for granted.

We too often assume they'll survive one generation to the next -- that those elephants or giraffes will be out there, somewhere.

They won't. Not unless we humans drastically change our ways.

In California, I met with Anthony Barnosky, executive director of Stanford University's Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve , and a global expert on extinction. He told me that we humans have -- at the very most -- 20 years to change the way we treat nature or we will bring about the sixth mass extinction event in the entire history of Earth. We are talking dinosaur-ending stuff here -- as in three-quarters of all known species, not just the cute and iconic ones, could vanish in a couple of centuries.

Having trouble imagining that world?

"The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone," he said. "That would be a very impoverished landscape."

It certainly would.

If you're not moved by that, consider the consequences for humans, too.

"We are basically annihilating the life on our planet -- and that is the only known life ... in the entire universe," Paul Ehrlich, also of Stanford, told me. "It's life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here. It's life that still makes it possible for us to live here. (If) we don't have the diversity of other organisms, we're done."

What's causing the collapse?

Barnosky has boiled it all down to three words: "power, food and money."

Power, meaning we're burning fossil fuels for electricity, transit and heat. That's warming the planet and wreaking havoc all over the world. We're not just talking polar bears here -- amphibians, oceans, everything is affected.

By food, he's referring to the fact that humans have plowed up or otherwise altered about 40% of the Earth's surface, he said, for agricultural production, much of it for livestock. Some biologists think we have to set aside huge chunks of land -- 50% of the Earth, according to Harvard University's E.O. Wilson -- to stop the sixth extinction from occurring, or to lessen its scope.

Add the population boom to this and you can see why farms are going to be a big issue this century.

Finally, money. That means poaching -- illegal networks are decimating the populations of some animals, including elephants, rhinos and the pangolin . And it means thinking of nature as an endless vat of cash.

"How do we get off of treating nature as this bottomless checking account and begin to treat it as an investment account, where we're living off the interest?" Barnosky asked during our interview.

I'm not sure how we'll change. But I have to hope that understanding the scope of this crisis is part of moving toward solutions. Giraffes are constricted by human development; they're poached for their tails, which are used as bracelets, and for their meat, according to the African Wildlife Foundation . We shouldn't see the giraffe's plight as an isolated crisis. Humans are reshaping the face of Earth as never before. It happens in slow motion, making us easily distracted from the cumulative destruction one generation passes to the next. And many of us are so disconnected from nature -- we see it through car windows, from the suburbs, on safari -- that we don't realize the scope of our responsibility in this collapse.

Imagine a world without giraffes.

In the long term, without big changes, that's what we reasonably can expect.

La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica (CNN) The "blue jeans" frog is practically screaming to be noticed. Its head is blood red, and its legs are denim blue. It looks like it's wearing jeggings. But this little critter, also known as the strawberry poison dart frog, is only about the size of a fingernail. It spends most of its time either high up in the trees in this Central American rainforest or rooting around in the gooey "leaf litter" of the forest floor.

As such, it's practically invisible.

Unless you open your ears.

Chit-chit-chit-chit-chit.

"It sounds like an insect. It buzzes."

That's Bryan Pijanowski, a "soundscape ecologist" from Purdue University and one of the few people paying attention to the fact that nature -- especially the amphibian part -- is growing exceptionally quiet these days. Pijanowski and collaborators from around the world have been strapping audio recorders to trees here at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. The microphones look like funny little robots -- boxes with windscreen ears on each side.

Researchers have installed microphone sensors in the rainforeset to listen for the sound of extinction.

The equipment has a critical mission.

It's listening for the sound of extinction.

Have you heard it already? I ask Pijanowski.

"I think so," he tells me. His muted, baritone voice sounds like a public radio host sharing secrets with you in a library. "There is evidence all around the world."

'Rapid extinctions'

Scientists fear Earth is on the verge of the sixth era of extinction.

There have been five mass extinctions in the planet's history.

Biologists fear we are on the verge of -- or have already entered -- the sixth era of extinction in Earth's history.

If we usher in the sixth, three-quarters of all species could disappear in a couple of centuries, says Anthony Barnosky, executive director of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve at Stanford and author of "Dodging Extinction: Power, Food, Money and the Future of Life on Earth."

"The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction," he told me, "is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone."

If you study amphibians, it can seem like that dystopian future already is here.

About 10% of birds and a third of mammals are at high extinction risk.

Not good.

But more than 40% of amphibians are in similar straits -- making them worse off than any other vertebrate group, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Amphibians are vanishing without warning, and often without explanation.

Chytrid fungus, which humans helped spread, has decimated frog populations around the world.

"In the past 30 years or so, we've seen really dramatic, really rapid extinctions for frog populations all over the world," says Steven Whitfield, a conservation ecologist at Zoo Miami who joined Pijanowski and me on the visit to Costa Rica this summer. "Many of these extinctions are due to habitat loss. But other extinctions have occurred in pristine rainforests like this -- places that look healthy but the frogs are telling us there's something clearly wrong."

'Unable to see it'

Whitfield spent years studying frogs at this research station in this particular forest.

I ask him to show me how it's done.

It doesn't take long to realize it's not easy work. When Whitfield conducts a study, he often ropes off a small plot of land and then spends hours searching for every single frog he can find.

The search begins with his ears.

CNN Map

"I'll hear [a frog] call and spend half an hour or more looking into a small patch of vegetation, knowing that it's right there and that I need to find it but unable to see it," he tells me.

Whitfield is an expert at pulling frog sounds out of the EDM freak-out that is the rainforest. If you've been, then you know these places, in healthy conditions, are LOUD. I actually had a hard time falling asleep some nights in Costa Rica because it sounded (awesomely) like the forest was yelling at me; and I woke up early to screams of howler monkeys. (Fun aside: Researchers warn newcomers to always wear shoes -- because, vipers -- and to watch the trees, since the "bullet ant," which delivers the world's most painful bite, like a bullet, is all around.)

Whitfield's amphibian-listening powers are impressive, but even he has trouble finding frogs by sight. He takes me and a group of researchers from the Center for Global Soundscapes deep into the forest just after dusk one evening, when some frogs tend to be the most active. Our headlamps provide a washed-out sort of tunnel vision of the diversity hiding all around us.

A Mexican Treefrog at La Selva Biological Station, which is a hub for field ecology.

Whitfield can hear and identify frogs at great distance. There's the "chit-chit-chit" of the blue jeans frog (the one with jeggings), the panicked meowing of a creature aptly nicknamed the "kitten frog." He hears the slot-machine rattle of the "glass frog," which has a translucent belly, allowing you to see organs through its skin. Smoky jungle frogs scream like human babies when they're threatened, and the tink frog seems to be named for its metallic call, which sounds like that ear-piercing noise a smoke detector makes when it wants you to change its battery.

This place is way beyond "ribbit." The sounds are staggering.

But finding these frogs by sight?

That's more difficult.

In a couple of hours, we saw only a handful of frogs.

Spiders almost seem easier to come by.

"Those bite," Whitfield says, pointing to one. "Don't touch that."

'Something is happening'

I'm grateful for the research Whitfield and other field ecologists have contributed when it comes to frogs. Their diligent, painstaking, searching-through-the-leaves work is how we know important (and fun) frog facts, like that the female blue jeans frog is an amphibian supermom.

A view from the forest canopy at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica.

Her tadpoles hatch on the forest floor, he says, but that's a precarious place for them, so she carries them, on her back, high up into the forest canopy, sometimes 10 to 15 meters off the ground -- about 33 to 50 feet. She drops the tadpoles off in little puddles of water up there in the forest canopy and makes a mental note of their location. She does this again and again, leaving her young all over the forest canopy. She remembers where all these tadpoles are (!!) and spends her days climbing the trees to deliver food.

"That's pretty complicated behavior for a tiny little frog," Whitfield says.

His research also has helped show that frogs at La Selva are in decline.

"We have really good long-term data on what's been happening with frog populations over four decades," he tells me. "In the forest here now, there's only about 25% as many frogs as there were sustained throughout the 1970s. And for us, that's a concern because it says that something is happening to this rainforest but we don't fully understand what that is."

The strawberry poison dart frog is sometimes called the blue jeans frog.

That's worth stating again.

Locally, only a quarter of the frogs from the 1970s remain.

Meanwhile, the human population jumped from less than 4 billion to 7.4 billion today.

Whitfield's search-the-forest work is critical.

But even he would say it could use a technological assist.

That's where Pijanowski and his tree-hugging microphones come in.

He's listening for changes Whitfield might not be able to see.

'Your ears ring'

Bryan Pijanowski is an ecologist by training. Before that, he was a "quiet alterboy-ish kind of kid" in the Midwest who also was sort of an audiophile -- and an amateur musician. He played guitar in a high school band called Destruction. "Everybody wanted you to play 'Freebird,'" he said, "so that's what I played -- over and over again."

In school, he set out to become a medical doctor but changed his mind after hearing the "dawn chorus" of a swamp in Michigan. He became obsessed with nature and its music.

Bryan Pijanowski is a "soundscape ecologist" from Purdue University. He's also director of the Center for Global Soundscapes.

So he studied birds and ecology, and eventually turned to "soundscapes," the emerging field of using sound to understand the shifts in the health and function of ecosystems.

The work makes him so sound-focused he now has to wear earplugs to sleep.

He can't stop listening.

"There are times when [the rainforest] is almost too loud," he tells me.

"It's like being too close to the speakers at a concert. Your ears ring."

La Selva is now one of his study sites. He's working to develop others around the world, including underwater to listen for changes to coral reefs. His microphones have taken him to the tip of South America and the deserts of Mongolia. But this site is special both because the rainforest is nearly untouched -- and because there's so much data. Pijanowski got his hands on recordings that date back to 2008 and started making his own recordings here in 2010. At the peak of his research, he'd installed 34 microphone sensors.

Now he has 255,000 recordings here, totaling about 6.8 years of tape.

He's still analyzing the data with the help of computer algorithms.

What he's heard -- or rather, what he doesn't hear -- definitely freaks him out.

'Acoustic fossils'

One evening, insects and frogs chattering outside, Pijanowski sits me down in an open-window classroom at the research station and shows me some of his sound files.

He visualizes the audio in charts called spectrograms.

These charts illuminate trends that a walk through the forest can't.

Take a look at this La Selva recording from 2008.

And then another from 2015, recorded under similar conditions.

Hear the difference?

Those are just two moments.

Pijanowski's team can compress a year's worth of sound into one chart.

Take a look at what happens when you look at those years side by side. The red parts of the charts indicate more audible activity. The main frog frequencies grow much bluer, and quieter.

A year of audio is compressed into spectrograms. Red indicates more sound coming from the forest. Blue is much quieter.

It's too soon to draw scientific conclusions from this, Pijanowski tells me.

But he's frightened.

"I'm worried that these would potentially become acoustic fossils," he says.

"In other words, the animals that are in these files are no longer alive. And the only record that we have of some of their presence is in an audio recording.

"That is somewhat disturbing to me, as a scientist and also as a citizen of this planet."

A collaborator of Pijanowski's, Michael Towsey, tells me he has a file of an Australian frog that's thought to be extinct -- a recording that already is an acoustic fossil.

You can listen to that frog's call here on the Internet.

But you can no longer hear it in nature.

'Most beautiful sound in the world'

Why does this matter?

There's the self-interested argument.

Here's Steven Whitfield's take on that.

"We are all dependent on the planet for clean water, for oxygen. And ecosystems not only provide food to people but rainforests like this are an important source of medicines. Some of the frogs that live in the rainforest here have chemicals in their skin that have been found to be important medicines. They can be painkillers or heart medicines. So these are things that can be really useful for medicine. And we'd like to not lose those. If we do lose those, it hurts us all."

Frog populations at La Selva Biological Station have plunged 75% since the 1970s, according to Steven Whitfield, Zoo Miami.

There's the ecosystem collapse argument.

Bryan Pijanowski: "Some of the theoretical work that we're doing and ecology suggests that we could have ecosystem collapse. And that's not good ... You don't wanna start removing organisms and expect the ecosystem to survive and function in a healthy way. It could very well mean that some of the things that we are much more emotionally attached to are lost."

That should be enough to sway a pragmatist.

Still, I think there's a more human reason you should care about the disappearance of amphibians.

Chances are you never or rarely see frogs in your day-to-day life. But when you learn about them -- those with translucent bellies, supermom instincts, blue-jean legs and poisonous skin, all of which are calling to be noticed by each other if not by us -- then it's hard to ignore their plight.

There are multiple causes of the amphibian apocalypse, but all the trouble points back to us. We've helped carry a killer fungus, called chytrid, around the globe, with disastrous consequences. Climate change has been implicated in frog die-offs. Pollution is a big problem since frogs live part-time in water and basically breathe through their skin.

They are the front lines -- the most vulnerable of species.

Yet few of us seem truly outraged by their disappearance.

Maybe that will change if we start listening more closely.

After all, frog choruses are some of the most fascinating songs in nature.

One recording from the island of Borneo -- called "dusk by the frog pond" -- was voted by the always-wise Internet as "the most beautiful sound in the world."

It's not too late to stop the sixth extinction from taking permanent hold of us, according to Barnosky, the Stanford researcher. We have at most 20 years to change our ways.

There's hope. But we must ditch fossil fuels, mitigating climate change. We have to stop the spread of invasive species and disease. And, in the view of one prominent biologist, we must set aside half the planet for the benefit of biodiversity and nature.

Otherwise, we risk silencing the frogs.

And perhaps the rest of nature, too.

Nosy Andragnombala, Madagascar (CNN) It's 2 a.m. when the half-moon wakes Hary. He senses its gravitational pull -- feels the moon coaxing fish out of a nearby reef and into his fishing nets here at the edge of Africa.

The 33-year-old fisherman seems to have an almost-telepathic relationship with the coral that surround this castaway island, which is little more than a heap of sand off the southwest coast of Madagascar. That relationship was passed down from his father, and it's one held by Vezo people here.

That word -- Vezo -- is taken to mean "at struggle with the sea," and residents of Nosy Andragnombala define themselves by that struggle. At birth, their umbilical cords are placed in seashells and tossed as an offering into deep blue waters.

They are part of the reef, and it is part of them.

There's little else: No electricity or freshwater. No industry, no jobs, no school. If you don't know the reef -- can't feel its tides and sense its moods -- then you can't survive.

And that makes what's happening on this island all the more tragic.

The reef is disappearing.

Coral have started turning white and dying. No one here understands why.

Local theories abound. Was it that hurricane? A chemical spill? A curse? Moake, an older neighbor of Hary's, told me white coral snagged his fishing net one day. It spooked him, and now he won't return to that spot. "I've already seen the white coral but I don't know what's caused it to become white," Hary tells me. "I don't know whether it's something in the water that's caused it to turn white."

Hary wakes well before dawn to cast fishing nets into the Mozambique Channel.

Yet, he's seen clues.

"There's a time when you see it," he says. "During the hot season."

Scientists can explain the mystery of the white coral.

But, frankly, I'm starting to see it as a curse, too.

A curse you and I cooked up.

'And then we wept'

By now, the storyline should be familiar: We humans are burning loads of fossil fuels and chopping down the rainforest, and that's causing the atmosphere to heat up rapidly.

That's true regardless of who's in the White House.

What's less understood is that the ocean is actually storing much of that heat.

Beneath the surface, there's evidence of a mass extinction brewing.

Coral are among the silent victims, and the results are undeniable.

This year, amid record heat, 93% of the Great Barrier Reef experienced bleaching , the term used to describe sick coral that eject the bright-colored algae that live on them. Bleached coral turn white, and while they're not dead, they are suffocating. The colorful algae feed the coral with the oxygen and sugar they need to survive. With prolonged or repeated bleaching, coral begin to die, eventually turning to rubble or becoming smothered by plants. It doesn't help that adding CO2 to the atmosphere and ocean also makes the waters more acidic, and worse still for the survival of coral.

CNN Map

The consequences are truly stunning.

Research indicates nearly all the world's coral reefs could be lost by 2050.

This is just one sign of the sweeping changes we humans are inflicting on the natural world, and ultimately on ourselves. Biologists say we are on the verge of the Earth's sixth mass-extinction event -- something akin to the end of the dinosaurs. Anthony Barnosky, a researcher at Stanford, told me we have perhaps 20 years to change course -- including addressing climate change -- or three-quarters of the world's species could vanish in coming centuries.

Overfishing and pollution also threaten coral in Madagascar. But climate change -- and the warming and ocean acidification that come with it -- is expected to land the soundest blow.

To stop that, we need to eliminate net carbon pollution.

Basically, that means purging fossil fuels from the global economy.

If we fail, there will be dire consequences.

Journalists often see the end of coral through the eyes of scientists. "I showed the results of aerial surveys of #bleaching on the #GreatBarrierReef to my students, And then we wept," Terry Hughes, a professor at Australia's James Cook University, wrote on Twitter in April.

Or we focus on losses for the tourism industry, which could be considerable.

Those perspectives matter.

More critical, though, are the 275 million people who depend on coral reefs for survival.

Hary and Lydia are raising six children. They can't afford to send them to school.

They're people like Hary, his wife, Lydia, and the six children they're raising.

Their fates are linked to a catastrophe we are helping to cause.

'My children can't eat'

Hary stops by my tent on his midnight walk to the ocean.

"Ooh-OOH! Ooh-OOH!" he calls.

Translation: Get up, reporter dude. The fish are waiting.

I stumble out of my sleeping bag, groggy and confused. Soon, we push off into the darkness of the Mozambique Channel in an outrigger canoe that Hary built by hand. Hary is in the back; the butt cheeks of his shorts are patched from years spent perched on the rails of the narrow boat. His second eldest son, Harizo, is up front. The 13-year-old is his dad's professional shadow.

A blood-colored moon hangs on the southern horizon. Father and son are faint silhouettes against the midnight sky and charcoal sea. The air tastes of salt, and the lull of the waves feels almost womb-like. Most surreal: The waters are bioluminescent, so each stroke of the paddle causes twinkling constellations of light to swim across the reef below us, as if mirroring the stars. The scene is exhilarating, especially for a city dweller like me.

In this moment I understand how completely tied Hary is to waters around the island.

As we paddle away from shore, sea melting into the distant horizon, I think about the disaster unfolding below the hull of the boat: The reef already is dying.

If we don't find anything out there, my children can't eat. Lydia, Nosy Andragnambala

A local nonprofit called Blue Ventures has been doing scuba surveys of reef health in this area. Their divers found 70% of reefs were bleached in April, at the peak of a heatwave, which is attributed partly to El Niño but also to the warming trend we're causing by burning fossil fuels.

Hary and the other fishermen know their catch is a fraction of what it once was.

"We really suffer when we go a week without catching anything," he says.

Their children cry from hunger, his wife, Lydia, tells me.

"If we don't find anything out there," she says, "my children can't eat."

'Ways of the sea'

Hary and Lydia's response to the crisis? Try harder.

They're nothing if not resourceful.

They moved to this island years ago because the reef on mainland Madagascar was too degraded -- and because the fishing was farther away. Hary lived out here with his father as a boy, and Lydia later joined him. They'd known each other as little kids in school. Neither was able to finish, though. They had to fish.

They have four kids together and care for at least two others; one is the son of a relative who died. The village is home to a few dozen people, and many depend, at least in part, on Hary's catch for their own survival.

Out here, people have to work together to make it.

After putting his net in the water about 3 a.m. Hary makes it back at shore by about 5 a.m. He is out again at dawn to collect his nets, and then spends the afternoon on the water, casting a long line with 50 hooks on it into the deep ocean just beyond the barrier of the reef.

In all, he spends about 12 hours per day at sea.

Lydia and the kids are hard at work, too. If you walk around Nosy Andragnombala, you're sure to see tiny children building and playing with wooden toy boats. They whittle out the hull and mast and then attach scrap-plastic sails. The kids push these little boats out onto the waves, tapping them with sticks so they catch the wind just so. When the children are about 10 years old, Hary says, they'll be ready to fish out on the water. He won't need to teach them to sail, though. They'll already understand how wind and wood work together.

Lydia searches reef flats near the island for octopus.

Like other women on the island, Lydia hunts octopus and cooks. At dusk, she boils fish on a fire while the sun sets and humpback whales perform their lumbering acrobatics on the horizon.

It's an idyllic place, but the struggle to live here is real. Several years ago, locals created an ocean reserve to protect the reef. They work with a village association to police the waters. Those efforts, combined with an intimate knowledge of the reef, make survival possible.

But barely.

One day, Lydia asks me, though an interpreter, if I want her to "teach me the ways of the sea."

I do, of course.

I slap some $12-a-bottle sunscreen on my face, and she leads me onto the ankle-deep reef flats, a spear in her hand and a notebook in mine.

'Hara, John!'

Lydia is a woman defined by brightness. Her shirt is magenta, yellow and blue. Her smile is loud and infectious, and she paints her face with a paste of mashed-up mangrove seeds, turning it orange and protecting it from the sun. Her intellect shines, too. If you duck down and follow her into her home, whose footprint is about the size of three queen mattresses and often sleeps eight, you'll notice two pieces of butcher paper pinned to the thatched walls. On them: English words translated into phonetics and then into Vezo, the local language.

"Water = oatere = rano."

"Fish = fise = fia."

"This is our octopus reserve = Dise ize ore aketapose rezeriva = Ato misy ty rezeriva horita nay."

She has been learning English in case a visitor showed up someday.

"Photo, John! Photo!"

Lydia points at a black urchin in the ankle-deep water. Each time she sees something new -- especially spiky, don't-step-on-that stuff, like an urchin -- she gestures frantically and insists I take a photo and write down the Vezo word for the creature in my notebook.

"John, photo!" A round, pink urchin.

"Photo!" Some greenish blob that apparently will kill you.

"Horita!"

That's an octopus, which she identifies by noticing the way the creature has arranged a pile of rocks, just so, in front of its secret den. The spot is completely unremarkable to me until she dips her spear into the hole and then twists it gently, like a baker rolling bread sticks. A tentacle emerges and wraps itself around the stick. Lydia pulls the creature out, notes that it is large enough to harvest sustainably (she won't take small octopuses because she worries about depleting the reef; and the community has established its own reef management system to try to protect its natural resources) and then stabs the tip of the spear through its Jell-O head.

A black ink cloud puddles in the water.

She ties the octopus to a bright blue string and drags it like a rag doll.

The tour continues.

Local coral is damaged for many reasons, but climate change could deliver the knock-out punch.

"Hara, John!"

Hara means coral.

Lydia points at one piece of healthy coral in a mess of rubble, a vast expanse of reef that looks something like the ruins of an ancient city. It stretches on like almost as far as I can see, a few live coral here and there, but mostly khaki, beige and gray.

It is heartbreaking to see this rubble.

Especially juxtaposed against her enthusiasm.

'Don't touch it'

I struggle with whether or how to engage Hary and Lydia in a conversation about climate change and the white coral -- this foreign curse that understandably makes little sense out here.

How do you tell someone that factories and cars and deforestation on the other side of the world are slowly heating up the entire planet, warming the ocean, making it more acidic, and messing up reefs worldwide? It's a tricky concept even for those of us who are climate culprits, who live in polluted cities and burn coal to pump electricity and air conditioning into our homes.

Out here, there are no factories, no air pollution, no cars or roads. Lydia says she's only been in a car once in her life, and it was to take her son to another family member's funeral. Her son cried, she says, because he didn't understand what was happening. Only one or two cell phones (solar powered) exist on the island, and there's a single dusty television set. Its owner uses it mostly to play Kung Fu movies from a USB stick for the island's kids.

Yet, this is an existential crisis.

To be Vezo, according to some, you have to work on the water.

This place -- and its culture -- could vanish with the reef.

I ask James Paul, a diver who surveys reefs in this area for Blue Ventures, and is Vezo himself, how he handles local conversations about climate change.

It's difficult, he says.

"I tell them just be careful, it's sick. Don't touch it. If you touch it, it's dead quick."

Of course, there are solutions.

But if you're on an island with essentially no carbon footprint there isn't much you can do to prevent global warming -- aside from sharing your story.

Their only real hope is for us to listen.

'We're as good as dead'

I invite Lydia to sit down on a sand dune to talk about all this.

I feel like the prophet of doom.

I tell her that people like me on the other side of the world -- people who are addicted to dirty energy sources, like coal and oil, and who drive around in cars and make things in factories that billow black smoke -- have a hand in turning the coral here white.

Lydia is a master at finding and identifying ocean creatures.

Yes, there are local problems contributing to problems with the coral. The cyclone that almost killed her son destroyed some coral, and overfishing plays a role. But scientists say people like me must change or coral reefs all over the world -- not just here -- will disappear.

She stares at me -- more in disbelief than anger.

Then she laughs, seemingly to cover the discomfort.

"We're as good as dead," she says.

"There'll be no more ocean livelihoods when the coral turns white."

"It scares me, people far away are causing this," she adds, rightly. "It's like they're the ones sending us this heat, which is destroying the coral. So what happens if there's something else they do or make that causes death here?"

She worries about her children. Before Hary's mother died two years ago, some of her kids lived with their grandmother on the mainland so they could attend classes. But after she died the family couldn't afford it, she tells me, so they had to come back to the island. ( School, by the way, costs only $3 per month per child , but the family earns too little.) She wants her children to grow up Vezo -- to know the ocean -- but she also wants them to have options.

Without an education, what other career options will they have?

What happens to them if all the coral turns white?

She turns to our translator and asks a question about me and a CNN videographer.

"So when they go back home, they'll teach people what they've learned here? They'll tell people about what they've seen? They'll tell people this is what life is like in Madagascar?"

She trails off.

"Maybe there are just too many cars where they're from."

I tell her the reason I've come is to tell her story. And that yes, I hope that when people turn on their lights or start their cars or get on airplanes (or, most importantly, vote for public officials who care about this) that they will think about a tiny island in Madagascar.

About people whose lives are threatened by the curse of the white coral.

But, secretly, I worry about those of us causing the curse.

Will we actually care enough to stop?

Side to side

The night after that conversation I wake up with a piercing headache.

I'd been dreaming about swimming down a pristine canal that suddenly turns into an industrial wasteland.

Blue water turns brown and smells of gasoline.

Smoke fills the air.

Nosy Andragnambala is located off the coast of Madagascar, a large island nation in eastern Africa.

When I awake, I realize the smell of gas is real. I unzip the tent and walk into a stiff wind, toward the beach. The horizon glimmers the color of peach, the first sign of dawn.

Where is that smell coming from? I can almost taste the tang of gasoline in my mouth. But how can that be? There are no motors on the island.

Then I see it.

Our boat, with its 25-horsepower Yamaha engine.

We used the motor to cut across the Mozambique Channel to this island in an hour, as opposed to the three or four or five needed to cross by sail. The irony didn't hit me at the time. I figured we would need the motorboat to maximize the reporting we'd do.

We're as good as dead. There'll be no more ocean livelihoods when the coral turns white. Lydia, Nosy Andragnambala

We make these choices by default. Too often, we don't see them or smell them -- don't actually feel the results of our actions. That's particularly true of climate change, since the effects are both diffuse and long term. Our actions now determine the type of world Lydia's great-great-great-great-great grandchildren will inherit. Climate change is sinister that way.

There are signs of progress.

We're moving into the clean-energy era. Technology is helping.

But all this is happening at a glacial pace.

And it doesn't help that US President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to scrap the Paris Agreement, which aims to get the world to ditch fossil fuels and limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius.

Will we do enough to save the coral -- and so many other species?

We depend on them more than we know.

I walk around the boat to get some fresh air, blowing in straight from the sea.

I sit down to watch the sunrise. A flock of birds hold formation in the wind. Crabs with little telescoping eyes skitter side to side in the sand. A hunk of dead coral is at my feet.

We are scheduled to leave Nosy Andragnombala in a day.

The scent of gasoline will evaporate then.

But our mark remains.
__label__world At least it wasn't a text, like the hasty, solitary line that exploded K.S. Narendran's world almost three years ago: "We deeply regret that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived."

His wife of 25 years, Chandrika Sharma, was one of the 239 people aboard the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing on March 8, 2014.

On Tuesday, Narendran learned the search for the missing plane had been suspended. He saw the email a little before noon at his home in the southeastern Indian city of Chennai.

"An email is an improvement over an SMS message," he posted on Facebook. "So, small mercies in an otherwise difficult period."

K.S. Narendran is no closer to knowing what happened to his wife, a passenger on MH370.

Then came the media requests for interviews. India Today, BBC, The Guardian, Deutsche Welle, NPR. He had become a spokesman for the MH370 families. After a group statement on the search suspension was made public, every journalist wanted to know Narendran's reaction.

He expressed deep disappointment that the search was over. Anger that the governments of Malaysia, China and Australia had not followed a recent recommendation to search another 25,000 square kilometers north of the last search area. And betrayal: Those governments, he said, had made a commitment to the families of the lost passengers, and now they were reneging.

JUST WATCHED The search for MH370 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The search for MH370 01:11

"I sensed my faith in the search and investigation erode precipitously, indeed faith in the entire gamut of institutional arrangements in place globally to keep us safe and secure, reassured that the journeys we undertake will indeed take us to our chosen destinations," he wrote on Facebook.

"MH370 didn't make it to Beijing. And we may never know why it didn't. We can never be sure that there will not be another tragedy."

The day seemed not to end. A flurry of emotions led to many moments of futility. Suspending the search was in part a message that the world was asking him to move on. As though he could.

The next morning, he boarded a plane for a business trip to Mumbai on India's west coast. After MH370, Narendran developed a dread for planes. Sometimes in his seat, he role-plays and goes to a dark place. What was the experience like for his wife?

Narendran met his wife in college and the two were married for 25 years.

The question consumes him to the point where he, an articulate man with considerable language skills, finds himself at a loss for words. He has to virtually kick himself out of that state and force himself to sleep. It's his only way out.

"I don't even wait for the plane's doors to close," he tells me. "I just try to sleep."

I first spoke with Narendran a few days after MH370 vanished from the skies. I reached out to him after a mutual friend showed me his Facebook posts, and we have been in touch ever since.

This time, we talk two days after he learned of the decision to stop the search. I want to ask him many things, but first he analyzes the mystery of the missing plane. He doesn't understand why the search was called off when debris -- confirmed to be from MH370 -- had been found off the coast of southern Africa.

"Common sense would suggest they would be hurrying to go and look there," he says. "It is really puzzling. I have wracked my brain all this time on why then have been such a laggard on this front."

That leaves him wondering whether there is truth to conspiracy theories that suggest a cover-up.

"Maybe they know more than what was said and they want a closure to this investigation," he says.

I can hear the frustration in his voice. I can hear the exhaustion.

I ask him about a difficult question a radio interviewer posed the day before: "Have you been able to have any kind of ceremony for her -- funeral?"

He attempted to answer: "We have had no ceremony. It's hard to think of one when you don't know ... when was the end? Where was the end?"

Narendran and I have discussed this several times in our many conversations via phone, Skype, email and even in person at a Bangalore coffee house. He said in the past that his family and friends suggested some sort of memorial to help him let go, move forward, bring closure and all those clichéd things we say after loss.

The truth is he doesn't take kindly to rituals and besides, he wouldn't even know how to begin planning such a ceremony. It would drain his energy, he tells me. And for what?

How do you say goodbye to the person you loved most -- without knowing?

In the summer of 2015, he initiated the process of obtaining a death certificate for Chandrika. The pragmatic part of him said it was needed to settle insurance policies, bank accounts, property matters and other assets his wife held.

All he really had was a message from Malaysia Airlines confirming Chandrika was a passenger on the missing plane. A death certificate would provide documentation.

But it has to be issued by a court in Kuala Lumpur, and he is still waiting. One of his unsavory chores is to keep writing to ask about the status, and it adds to a host of other reminders.

They include the daily walks he used to take with Chandrika. After she was gone, he often imagined conversations with the woman he met in college and had shared life's joys and disappointments with.

Where have you been, Chandrika?

Oh, many places. All at the same time. Can you believe that?

When will you be back?

Your guess is as good as mine.

For good. That is.

What if I am gone for good?

He fantasized about new facts being unearthed that might provide incontrovertible evidence. Then he could say: Case closed, like the ending of a Sherlock Holmes story. Time to move on.

But those facts never came, and for almost three years now, Narendran has lived life with crushing uncertainty. There were days that were more jarring than others: when the missing plane was in the news, when debris was found, when the first anniversary came and then the second. And now, the end of the search.

But to him, day 364 was the same as day 365. It was another day without her.

I sense that perhaps Narendran has begun to move on, however slow the progress. I ask him if he still speaks with his wife.

"My conversations lately have been with myself," he says. "What I wish to do with my life. And I don't think I have answers yet."

Nor has the uncertainty abated as much as he would have liked.

One reason, he surmises, is his role as spokesman for Voice 370, the support group for families of the missing.

"That role travels with me 24 hours a day," he says. "It has a way of keeping alive the questions and continues the agonizing. I think the questions about finding answers, finding an explanation that is credible enough, sufficiently substantiated, remains very important.

"Why? I have often asked myself the same question. And I don't think I have a very clear answer. The sense of incredulity about all that's happened doesn't just go away. That something like this should ever have happened where there is neither a trace nor understanding or explanation of how this might have happened is very deeply disturbing."

Then there all the relatives and friends who constantly ask him questions or want an update. "Tell me what is happening," they say.

"There is always this underlying assumption that the families know something more than the rest of the world. And we don't," he says.

So it remains unfinished business.

"I also frankly believe there are larger questions of fairness, justice, accountability that can't be so easily put away," he says. "There are levels of agitation and I tell myself: I can't just let this pass. I can't get on with life. I have not flushed my system of MH370."

These are the sorts of things Narendran is often not asked about in the myriad interviews he gives. How do you even begin in a 5-minute radio or TV segment? But I have learned about him over the course of our acquaintance.

From the beginning, I felt his strength in the quietness of his voice and the power of his words. He is someone who doesn't always emote outwardly -- I've never heard him cry, although on several occasions he has brought tears to my eyes.

He tells me that writing about MH370 and his life without Chandrika has helped him enormously. It has forced him to learn about himself.

People who suffer great pain or sorrow often find refuge in prayer and hope. Many of the families of MH370 held onto the hope that everyone on that plane was still alive. That included some of Narendan's relatives.

But Narendran was not one of them. He found comfort in his writing. It helps him gain insight on how he has been dealing with life after tragedy.

The eye cannot see itself, he tells me, quoting Shakespeare. "I need to hear from others on how they see me and then reflect back on what resonates with me."

We end our conversation there. What I don't tell him is that I can see he has already done a lot of reflection; that he's already come a long way in his recovery. The search for the missing plane may have ended Tuesday, but what continues is Narendran's quest to find himself again.
__label__world (CNN) Sixty-four years ago, Tenzing Norgay, who's also known as Sherpa Tenzing, and Sir Edmund Hillary became the first two people to reach the summit of Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain.

This 2015 photograph shows a distant view of Mount Everest in China's Tibet Autonomous Region.

Monday is the anniversary of their accomplishment, which is celebrated as Everest Day.

Children have been orphaned, and need food and clothing

(CNN)

Mudslides and floods have killed more than 450 people in Sierra Leone including more than 150 children. That number is expected to rise as hundreds are missing.

Sierra Leone buried at least 300 victims of devastating floods.

Torrents of mud wiped away entire communities. Nearly 20,000 people have been displaced.

"Many of our compatriots have lost their lives, many more have been gravely injured, and billions of leones' worth of property [has been] destroyed in the flooding and landslides that swept across some parts of our city," President Ernest Koroma said

Volunteers search for bodies from the scene of heavy flooding and mudslides in Regent, just outside of Sierra Leone's capital Freetown.

Safe drinking water and shelter are now the immediate priorities for thousands of people, according to the United Nations . One of the main concerns is an outbreak of cholera and malaria.

"Some residents have gotten skin infections from the water they have been washing in, and officials are putting in place plans for cholera preparedness and prevention," Deputy Health Minister Madina Rahman said. "We are equipped to a point. We can't do it alone."

Youssif had extensive facial reconstruction and counseling in the United States

Arwa Damon is a senior international correspondent based in CNN's Istanbul bureau. In April, she received the World of Children's 2017 Crisis Award for her work starting INARA, a charity which aids children affected by war. While at the ceremony, Damon had the chance to spend time with a young man who holds a special place in her heart. The opinions in this article are solely those of the author.

(CNN) "Superman is one of my favorite superheroes because he also struggled to fit in and was different, but in the end he was accepted and made his mark and I can somehow relate to that," said Youssif to those gathered at the World of Children gala in Los Angeles in April.

Now in his early teens, he looked so handsome, confident and unwavering. This was the same young man we had met a decade ago who was sullen, angry and mad at a world he was too young to even understand.

"All children should have a chance to make their dreams come true," Youssif said at the conclusion of his speech.

__label__politics (CNN) Gallup released new polling this week with an eye-popping headline: Donald Trump's re-election numbers are very similar to those of Barack Obama in 2010 and Bill Clinton in 1994.

Wait, WHAT? The narrative of Trump's first 15 months in office has been that he is at historic polling lows. Then this.

What gives? In an attempt to suss that out, my friend -- and resident CNN big brain -- Harry Enten and I exchanged a bunch of emails trying to figure out the Gallup result and what, exactly, it tells us about Trump, Republicans' chances in 2018 and Trump's own fortune heading into his 2020 reelection race.

I've reproduced that email conversation below.

: I was struck by this new Gallup poll -- or at least the headline: " Trump's Re-Elect Figures Similar to Those of Obama, Clinton ."

Trump is at the same place as Obama and Clinton! That's remarkable, given that he has had the worst 15-month polling start of any president in the modern era.

Then I read the fine print. Yes, 37% say that Trump deserves re-election which is the exact same number who said that about Bill Clinton in 1994 and Barack Obama in 2010.

BUT, the numbers for Obama and Clinton are from October 2010 and 1994, respectively. That's after a full year of Republicans spending millions of dollars to campaign against them. We are only in April for Trump -- and the fall campaign is at its earliest stages. Virtually no ads attacking him have even run.

So, apples and oranges, right? Or wrong? And what else did you see in the poll?

Enten: Thanks for the email. I think you're on the right track with thinking this poll result isn't all it's cracked up to be.

Gallup itself released numbers closer to this point (late April of the midterm year) for both Obama and Clinton. Obama was at 46% in late March and 48% in late May of 2010. Far above Trump. Clinton was at 46% in late March and 40% in late April of 1994.

So, I don't know why Gallup did what it did. Of course, one could argue that because Trump's approval rating has been so steady that it will be in a similar position later this year, but I don't like to make assumptions like that. Who knows what all the ads Democrats will run this summer and fall will do to his ratings?

Does that make sense? And I also think there are larger problems with this question, if you're interested in hearing about them?

Cillizza: OK. We agree on that one: The Gallup poll is making an apples-to-oranges comparison.

And, yes, tell me what else you don't love in the poll.

One thing I don't want to lose sight of amid all of this: In 1994 and 2010, the president's party took an absolute beating at the polls -- losing control of the House in both elections. So, even if Trump winds up at 37% in October -- like Clinton and Obama -- that's not great news for Republicans.

Enten: Re: your last point, I think you're 100% correct. The reelect figure is really a stand-in for presidential approval. In the : Re: your last point, I think you're 100% correct. The reelect figure is really a stand-in for presidential approval. In the latest Gallup poll , Trump's at a 38% approval rating. Based upon history, that, on average, points to a net seat loss in the high 30s. Democrats only need a net gain of 23 for control.

So perhaps biggest problem I have with this question is it doesn't make it a choice between a Democrat and a Republican. There's a good chunk of voters who belong to the same party as the President who are thinking to themselves that they want a different person representing their party, but will ultimately vote for their party's nominee.

If you're truly interested in gauging the presidential matchup at this point, I think it's better to ask a question which forces the respondent think about a Democrat and a Republican. At the very least, it gets us beyond simply the incumbent. As it stands, this question is really just another way of asking about approval and disapproval. So what's the point?

When we ask about a Democrat vs. a Republican, it's when we see how unique Trump's standing in the polls really is...

Thoughts?

Cillizza: If by "unique," you mean "historically bad," then I am with you ;)

I think the country was significantly polarized before the 2016 election. But that election coupled with the fact that Trump won and immediately began governing in ways to please his base (and not a lot of other people) took that polarization to new heights.

The impact of that rush to your partisan extreme on polling is that almost EVERY question you can ask essentially becomes a proxy for this one: "Do you like President Trump or not?" Which makes nuance in polling -- and how it informs opinions about Trump -- very hard to divine.

Enten: I think there's something to that. If you're a Republican, you like Trump. As I've written about, : I think there's something to that. If you're a Republican, you like Trump. As I've written about, the Republican Party is Trump's now . Heck, take a look at where Trump's approval rating is with Republicans. It's in the mid 80s (very close to the re-elect question). It basically makes it impossible for there to be a primary challenger who has any shot of taking Trump down.

But to your larger point, I think in order to fully grasp the historicity of Trump's bad ratings, we need to look at how he's doing against potential Democratic nominees. Then we need to compare that to how other presidential incumbents were doing at this point.

That is, we need to make an apples-to-apples comparison that takes into account the polarized era in which we live.

In a CNN poll conducted earlier this year, Democrat Joe Biden and Democrat Bernie Sanders both led Trump by double digits among registered voters. I cannot begin to explain how bad of a position that is.

There were six different times since the 1948 election with polls at this point in the cycle in which the eventual matchup was surveyed.

1948: President Harry Truman was tied with Republican challenger Thomas Dewey

1956: President Dwight Eisenhower held a 8-point advantage over Democrat Adlai Stevenson

1980: President Jimmy Carter held a 7-point lead over Republican Ronald Reagan

1984: President Ronald Reagan was tied with Democrat Walter Mondale

1996: President Bill Clinton was ahead of Republican Bob Dole by 9 points

2012: President Barack Obama was up 8 points over Republican Mitt Romney

Note that in none of these polls was the incumbent in anywhere near as bad shape as Trump is right now. I'll note there were other years where the eventual matchup wasn't polled at this time, but in all of those the incumbent was either tied or well ahead of the leading challenger.

Trump is in historically bad shape. He could recover and do better than expected, but at least right now it's not looking great.

Cillizza: RIGHT.

This is the broader point I keep reminding people about. Sure, Trump's approval numbers have improved marginally over the past six weeks or so. But, he is STILL in a position that, if history is any guide, suggests his party is in very bad shape in the 2018 midterms and Trump himself faces an uphill fight to win a second term in 2020.

The retort to that point is something like: "2020 is a long time from now." And it is! 924 days to be exact!

But Trump's approval numbers just seem to have a very hard floor and a very hard ceiling -- almost certainly because of how polarized we are as a country and how much the policies Trump has pursued have pushed that polarization.

So while, sure, anything can happen, the likelihood of a double-digit (or even high single-digit) improvement or decline in Trump's approval ratings seems very, very low to me.

Right? Wrong? Tie a bow on all of this for me.

Enten: I think these are all valid points. I think as I've pointed out before Trump is scoring pretty well on the economy, and he's still stuck in the high 30s or low 40s. That's quite unusual.

There just hasn't been a ton of movement in Trump's numbers. I mean he couldn't even hit 50% approval in the usual post-inauguration bump.

How in the world is his approval rating going to go higher than the low 40s? Maybe, he gets a bump if special counsel Robert Mueller says "Trump is good." Maybe he gets a bump if we start seeing an even better economy.

I think the better question that I'm asking in a piece that hopefully will see the light of day is whether you believe the normal rules of politics apply to Trump. You're going to see a lot of fancy models out there about Trump and low approval ratings...

But let's be clear, presidents who have approval ratings of 40% usually don't get reelected. That's especially the case when their favorability rating (a slightly different measure) is also in the same area.

Unless the normal rules don't apply to Trump, the only way he wins in 2020 if his approval rating is 40% is for the Democrats to nominate an equally unpopular candidate.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) While Democrats came up short in last Tuesday's Arizona special election -- losing by fewer than five points in a district Donald Trump carried by 21 points -- the results offer yet another sign the party still holds the energy edge heading into November's midterm election.

As we approach a cluttered stretch of the primary calendar, the results from those contests -- and the next wave of campaign fundraising reports in June -- will help to clarify the Democratic Party's prospects this fall.

That deadline will offer a good idea of whether Democrats can maintain momentum. More than three dozen Democratic House candidates outraised Republican incumbents for the second quarter in a row after the most recent filing.

Trump's national approval rating, meanwhile, continues to hover around 40%, which poses an additional challenge for GOP candidates running this year.

With all that in mind, we are moving a dozen Republican held House districts to a more competitive rating. Each race below is moving in the direction of the Democrats even though the Republican remains favored in all of them.

As a reminder, Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats in order to win control of the House. Of the 11 races rated Lean Democratic by CNN, seven are currently held by Republicans, as are 19 of the 21 races rated Toss-Up. Of the 25 races CNN now rates as Lean Republican, all are Republican-held -- or in the case of the Ohio 12th District seat vacated by Pat Tiberi, had been held by a Republican.

AZ-06: You might not have to look very far for reverberations from last week's special election results. The neighboring 6th District, represented by GOP Rep. Dave Schweikert, is more favorable terrain for Democrats than the 8th District -- more suburban and home to a higher percentage of college graduates. Trump won here by 10 points, a much slimmer margin than Mitt Romney's 21-point spread in 2012. Arizona has a late primary at the end of August, but Democrats believe Arizona State University nursing professor Heather Ross has the potential to make this race more competitive if she emerges as the nominee. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

AR-02: Arkansas state Rep. Clarke Tucker gives Democrats a candidate who could make inroads in the 2nd District, home to Little Rock. Tucker announced his bid in early February, and despite the late start managed to beat GOP Rep. French Hill in fundraising by about $130,000 in the first quarter. Trump won the district by 10 points, slipping from Romney's 12-point margin four years earlier. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

CA-04: There are some shared qualities with the northern Sacramento suburbs of California's 4th District and the Phoenix suburbs from Arizona's 8th District. Both have a large contingent of senior citizens. They also have a similar racial breakdown. Trump won only 53% in this district, falling off five points from Romney's 58% mark in 2012. Veteran GOP Rep. Tom McClintock has been outraised by leading Democratic candidate Jessica Morse in three consecutive fundraising quarters. Morse also has a $715,000 to $676,000 cash on hand lead. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

FL-16: GOP Rep. Vern Buchanan has won comfortably the last two cycles, and while he remains a heavy favorite he'll have to work a bit to earn a seventh term in this Sarasota-area district. He's sitting on $2.5 million in the bank and raised $480,000 in the first quarter. He'll likely face Sarasota attorney David Shapiro in November. The Democrat raised $400,000 in the first quarter and is just shy of half a million cash on hand. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

IL-14: Lauren Underwood, a registered nurse and former Department of Health and Human Services adviser in the Obama administration, scored 57% of the vote in a crowded Democratic primary last month. Democrats are hopeful she can give GOP Rep. Randy Hultgren a serious challenge in the 14th District, which is made up of Chicago exurbs. Hultgren has benefited from weakly-funded challengers in previous cycles -- a luxury he likely won't have against Underwood, who raised $465,000 in the first quarter. Hultgren brought in $360,000 -- but still has a significant cash on hand advantage ($783,000 vs. $235,000). While Trump won this district by four points in 2016, Barack Obama carried it with 50% in 2008. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

MI-01: This northern Michigan district, which includes the Upper Peninsula, went for Trump by 22 points, but gave Romney and McCain single-digit victories. The race is shaping up to be a contest between two Marine Corps veterans -- incumbent GOP Rep. Jack Bergman and Democratic candidate Matthew Morgan. Morgan has outraised Bergman in each of the past two quarters and now holds a $317,000 to $307,000 advantage in terms of cash on hand. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

NJ-03: GOP Rep. Tom MacArthur's support for Trump's agenda (health care repeal and tax cuts) and a strong challenge from likely Democratic nominee Andy Kim make this swing district competitive. The district went for Trump by six points, but backed Barack Obama by four in 2012. Kim, a former national security adviser to Obama, outraised MacArthur by more than $200,000 in the first quarter, though the Republican still holds an advantage of roughly $270,000 in cash on hand. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

NM-02: Both parties are facing primary fights in the 2nd District, which opened up when GOP Rep. Steve Pearce decided to run for governor in the Land of Enchantment. On the Republican side, it appears to be a contest between state Rep. Yvette Herrell and former Hobbs Mayor Monty Newman. Xochitl Torres Small looks to the the frontrunner for the Democratic nod. The attorney and former field representative for Sen. Tom Udall raised $313,000 in the first quarter, beating Newman and Herrell combined. While registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in this district, Trump carried it by 10 points, which was a wider margin than Romney's seven-point win in 2012. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

OH-01: All eyes in Ohio are on the 12th District special election in August, but the House race in the Buckeye State to watch in November is likely to be the 1st District, where GOP Rep. Steve Chabot could face a serious challenge from Democrat Aftab Pureval. Pureval, the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts, outraised Chabot by nearly half a million dollars in the first quarter of 2018. This district, which includes the western and northern parts of the Cincinnati metro area, went for Trump by seven points and Romney by six points. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

OH-07: Speaking of Ohio, GOP Rep. Bob Gibbs improved a bit on his lackluster $86,000 fundraising quarter at the end of 2017 -- raising $113,000 in the first quarter of 2018. Democrat Ken Harbaugh, a former Navy pilot, hauled in $441,000 -- after raising $272,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gibbs still has $1.3 million in the bank compared to Harbaugh's $726,000. The Gibbs campaign and Ohio Republicans have been attacking Harbaugh's primary opponent, Patrick Pikus, who is little known and has only raised $5,000 for his campaign -- perhaps in an attempt to raise his name ID. Democrats see the move as an indication the Gibbs campaign views Harbaugh as a threat. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

WA-05: Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the House GOP leadership, has a tough race on her hands against Democrat Lisa Brown, the former chancellor of Washington State University Spokane. A recent Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the House GOP leadership, has a tough race on her hands against Democrat Lisa Brown, the former chancellor of Washington State University Spokane. A recent poll of the district showed McMorris Rodgers leading Brown by six points, 44% to 38%, with 16% undecided. McMorris Rodgers hauled in $776,000 in the first quarter compared to $649,000 for Brown -- and the Republican leads in cash on hand by more than $700,000. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

WI-06: Even with House Speaker Paul Ryan's retirement, a lot of attention in the Badger State will be paid to the 1st District race. But the contest in the 6th District could be the best pickup opportunity in the state for Democrats, with Dan Kohl -- nephew of former Sen. Herb Kohl -- giving the party a serious challenger to GOP Rep. Glenn Grothman. Kohl has outraised Grothman now in three consecutive quarters and has $136,000 more in the bank to start April. This is another district where Trump outperformed previous Republican candidates, winning by 17 points. Romney won it by seven in 2012 while Obama carried the district in 2008. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

__label__world Hoi An, Vietnam (CNN) New Yorker Neal Bermas had traveled around the world, but Vietnam literally stopped him in his tracks.

There, the businessman saw starving children in Ho Chi Minh City while on a trip to Asia in 1999.

"There were bands of these poor, homeless kids on the streets ... and they were begging for milk, not for money," Bermas said. "It stayed with me."

Bermas, who did consulting for hotels and restaurants, saw there was an effort under way to help street kids get simple food service jobs. He realized he could help.

Combining his business savvy with an ambitious nonprofit model, in 2007 he co-founded STREETS International , based in Hoi An. The organization provides at-risk young people with a rigorous 18-month training program, preparing them for careers in Vietnam's booming culinary and hospitality industries.

"(They) come from the whole country with all kinds of very, very difficult paths," Bermas said. "We offer them a structured program and a very rich apprenticing experience."

STREETS' participants range in age from 16 to 22. The group provides housing, meals, medical care, clothing and support services to help trainees gain skills and confidence for employment at top resorts.

Some come from more than 600 miles away to participate in the free program. They receive a stipend and transportation assistance to visit their family.

"We build possibilities and aspirations for those communities," Bermas said. "Where we take one young person from the village, suddenly ... the whole village starts to think about, 'maybe my kid, too.'"

Currently, 75 trainees are enrolled. The group's full-time staff and teachers are all Vietnamese, and Bermas often brings in chefs and other experts to enhance the training.

He and his team work with the government and ensure they follow all safety and labor laws and regulations.

JUST WATCHED CNN Hero Neal Bermas: 'Oodles of Noodles' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Neal Bermas: 'Oodles of Noodles' 02:39

By the end of this year, nearly 250 young people will have completed the program. Bermas said 100% of STREETS graduates have found employment, mostly at four- and five-star hotels in Vietnam.

"It works. And that's a push to do more to reach more young people," he said, adding that the group stays in regular contact with all graduates for at least two years after graduation, most longer.

Bermas plans to expand the program to other areas of the country.

CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Bermas about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: Who are the young people applying to your program?

Bermas: All the young people in our program come from poverty -- without enough to eat, without electricity and plumbing. From leprosy villages, from HIV backgrounds; some have been trafficked, sometimes more than once.

Part of the process of selecting and getting to know the trainees is that we visit wherever they're from -- the home, in many cases the orphanage, the NGO, the isolated village, sometimes even a street corner. We want to know the most about them we possibly can, how difficult their conditions have been and how they have been wounded by life. Or what support there is. It's a great resource to a young person's development in our program.

This is the first real chance for many (of them) to transition from poverty and life on the streets to the dignity of self-sufficiency that comes with a successful career. You shouldn't discount a young person's future because of their past, no matter how dire it's been.

CNN: You've created an extensive program. Besides the hands-on culinary and hospitality training, what else is involved?

Bermas: There's a whole team of colleagues, educators and professionals who have worked developing all this. We have daily curriculums and lesson plans, from the first day to the last day -- designed to deliver quite sophisticated, substantive material.

We have a computer language lab. We have tutoring every day of the week. English language instruction is a big part. And a whole array of life skills, from hygiene to CPR, budgeting and banking, physical exercise and being healthy.

Depending on which track the trainees are going, they have classroom experience in a small teaching kitchen if they're becoming professional chefs, or in the classroom to learn about hospitality and service. And our three eateries have many purposes; each one brings a different set of skills for apprenticing.

CNN: You left Manhattan behind to do this. Why did you decide to move to Vietnam?

Bermas: The truth is, the early vision was that I would work with colleagues and assemble a team here. And I could travel back and forth and make sure everything was going well.

It became clear very early on that if I was to really realize this ambition on behalf of the young people in the program, I would have to be here and do it. It was probably the best, if not certainly the most meaningful, decision I've made in my adult life.

This work at STREETS is never easy, but it's important. I know now that I need to be sure there is a STREETS around 10 years from now.

CNN: You've kept your focus on the local community. How have they embraced you?

Bermas: It's traditional here in Vietnam when you open a new business that the business community and friends and family all send you large wreaths of flowers opening day to wish you good luck.

The day we opened the restaurant -- we'd been working so hard to open, to get this thing going -- and I came down the street, and there were so many of these big, beautiful wreaths full of flowers that said in Vietnamese, "Congratulations" and "Welcome." And who had sent them? All the local shops and friends we had made. I was so touched by this.

The flowers poured out into the street. It was amazing. I literally couldn't get in the front door of the restaurant.

__label__politics (CNN) The headline on Sean Hannity's website blared the news: "BLUE WAVE CRASHING: Poll Shows Americans Side with TRUMP on Economy, Security."

The piece on hannity.com was actually just a summary of a broader piece written by the Washington Examiner's Paul Bedard -- which carried the same headline and the same message: Republicans (and Trump) are actually in much better shape heading into the November election than people believe.

That conclusion was based on polling conducted by Zogby Analaytics, a firm run by pollster John Zogby, and shared exclusively with Bedard.

Here's the spine of the argument made in it:

"When asked 'Who do you trust more?' on the economy, it was Trump over Democrats 41 percent to 35 percent, and on national security the president again led, 40 percent to 38 percent. ... Added to the poll's other findings that support for Democrats is down among millennials, blacks, and so-called Walmart and NASCAR voters, it would appear that Trump is back in favor among voters and that the ballyhooed 'Blue Wave' is dissipating."

Khartoum, Sudan — Amal is 11 years old and seeking a divorce.

The young Sudanese girl was in elementary school when a 38-year-old man asked for her hand in marriage.

Her father accepted the proposal, and Amal (not her real name) was immediately wed.

In Sudan, child marriage has been woven into the fabric of the country's culture, driven by tradition and poverty. More than a third of girls there are married before their 18th birthday, according to a 2017 UNICEF report , and 12% are wed before they reach 15. Under the country's 1991 Personal Status Law of Muslims, children can marry when they reach "maturity," which is only 10 years old. It's the lowest legal age of marriage in Africa.

The recent case of Sudanese teenager Noura Hussein , sentenced to death earlier this year for killing her husband as he tried to rape her, has focused attention on child marriage in Sudan. Now 19, Noura was just 15 when she was forced to marry a man more than twice her age.

Pre-teen bride Amal says she was repeatedly abused at the hands of her husband, who smoked cigarettes as he beat her.

In an interview in Khartoum, her father sitting beside her, Amal told CNN that her husband had another wife who lived in the same house with them.

After the abuse, Amal said that she went to her father for help, but he kept sending her back. Eventually she escaped with the aid of her husband's first wife.

"He treated me horribly," Amal said of her husband. "Then when the beatings became every day, I went to the police station."

A doctor who evaluated Amal's injuries at the station found evidence that she'd been tied up and assaulted.

Though he had heard her story before, Amal's father wept while his daughter talked to us.

"Twice, she came to my home, twice, and was terrified and frightened. I sent her back," he told CNN. "I am regretful."

Amal's father, who works as a tinsmith laborer in the street, is raising six daughters on his own. When he described why he married Amal off -- despite her young age -- he cited tradition and honor.

"When I let him marry my daughter, it was on trust, on the basis that he would look after her, let her continue with her education and honor her as agreed," he said. "But I found that this was not happening. It was all beating, humiliation and provocation."

Many Sudanese parents marry off their daughters in hopes of avoiding poverty, violence or family shame. Unmarried women are often stigmatized as agir, "infertile," or bayra, "not demanded for marriage." But, in reality, child brides are more likely to face sexual, physical and psychological violence, according to UNICEF.

"I didn't know that getting married at a young age could have such consequences," Amal's father added.

Despite what happened to Amal, he says it won't stop him from marrying off his younger daughters.

In December 2015, the Sudanese government joined the African Union campaign to end child marriage on the continent. One year later, Sudan received recommendations from the United Nations with the same goal.

In the intervening years, Sudan's National Council for Child Welfare (NCCW) formulated a strategy for abandoning the practice, but the reform sparked counter-mobilization by conservative religious groups in the country and little has been done to implement it.

The SEEMA Center, a nongovernmental organization working with victims and survivors of gender-based violence in Khartoum, is among civil-society groups working to change that.

Nahid Jabralla, director of SEEMA, has been campaigning in support of Amal, Noura and other young women and girls with stories like theirs.

"Many of the cases brought to SEEMA Center are related to forced marriage, child marriage or domestic violence, including marital rape and cases to do with injustice," Jabralla told CNN. "However, what is brought to SEEMA Center is a very small portion of the cases of the violations that women and children are subjected to in the Sudan."

The Sudanese government has not responded to CNN's requests for comment on child marriage in the country, or Noura's case.

While official statistics show that 34% of girls in Sudan get married before they reach 18, this varies significantly across the country. In Sudan's East Darfur State, for example, 57% of women marry before the age of 18, according to a 2014 UNICEF health survey

Sudan is full of Nouras and few have seen justice, Jabralla says.

Despite these odds, young girls like Amal are still fighting for a different future.

The 11-year-old, who likes to play with dolls and has filled countless notebooks with poetry, is adamant on having her divorce finalized.

As soon as it is, she wants to get back to school, to be reunited with her friends.

Asked what advice she would give other young girls fighting early marriage, Amal looked down at her hands.

"Be brave," she said.

"I wish I was braver."

The father of Richard Harris, a key member of the team of international experts involved in the dramatic rescue mission, died soon after all the boys were freed.

Harris, an anesthetist and underwater cave explorer who is also known as Harry, was the last man out of the cave Tuesday.

"Early this morning Harry's father passed away here in Adelaide... after they'd all come out of the cave," said Andrew Pearce, of the MedSTAR rescue service.

Pearce said Harris had "given his all, his family have given the support and we've given the support as well as an organization."

__label__world Hong Kong (CNN) China's navy is getting bigger and better and doing it at a speed unmatched by any nation around the globe.

Earlier this month, the People's Liberation Army Navy launched two 13,000-ton Type 055 guided-missile destroyers -- Asia's largest, most sophisticated and most lethal combat ships.

"This ship in particular has a sophisticated design, stealth features, radars, and a large missile inventory. It is larger and more powerful than most US, Japanese, and South Korean destroyers," said Rand Corp. senior analyst Timothy Heath.

The double launching shows Beijing's unmatched military shipbuilding ability and its desire to project naval power far from Chinese shores, said Heath and other military analysts.

One of the two Type 055 guided-missile destroyers takes water at a shipyard in Dailan.

According to a report by China Daily, posted on the PLA's English-language website, the Type 055 will have double the firepower of China's Type 052D destroyers, which it said are currently "the largest and most powerful surface combatant commissioned in the PLA Navy."

China says each new destroyer will have 112 vertical launch tubes, from which it can fire long-range attack missiles, the equivalent of the US Navy's Tomahawk missile used as recently as Washington's strikes in Syria this year.

The missile launchers can also carry weaponry to target incoming aircraft, enemy ships and missiles. Anti-submarine warfare operations are the responsibility of two helicopters aboard each Type 055.

The new destroyers also boast a stealth design and high-end electronic battle management system to integrate Chinese aircraft carrier battle groups, the China Daily report said.

"This ship ... is designed for escorting Chinese aircraft carriers to more distant regions such as the Middle East," said Heath.

That would give China a so-called "blue water" navy, one that can operate far from homeland coasts, something that right now only the US Navy can do in overwhelming numbers across the world's oceans.

"The PLA Navy is progressively building a particularly well-defined 'blue water' fleet that will be in place at a certain date," said Peter Layton, a former Australian military officer and now fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute.

'The majesty of the Chinese state'

But through the Type 055's sheer size, it can send a message in waters closer to the Chinese mainland too.

"The Type 55As are big, very big," said Layton."The ships are a demonstration of the power, prestige and indeed majesty of the Chinese state and its ruling party," he added.

The Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam is the closest US match to China's new Type 055A destroyers.

China's new ships displace about 3,000 more tons than US or South Korea warships that have been the ones to look up to in Asian waters.

In the South China Sea, the Type 055As will have a considerable size advantage over the US Navy's 10,000-ton Ticonderoga-class cruisers and 9,000-ton US Arleigh Burke-class destroyers.

"The Type 55As handled aggressively they might be able to crowd US Navy ships out simply by their size," Layton said.

In the optics test outside China, big is almost always better, he added.

"It could be that China places more weight on naval diplomacy and thinks port visits from a very large warship will simply overawe the locals," Layton said.

Back in China, the July 3 double launch made big statements about what the US and its Asian allies, and indeed the world, can expect from Beijing in the future.

The two Type 055s join two others put into the water in June , 2017, and April this year. Those ships came off a production line in Shanghai. The most recent two came off lines in Dalian, in Liaoning province, according to the China Daily.

It "showcases the enormous capacity of Chinese shipbuilders," Heath said. "Most countries, including the United States, usually launch one ship at a time due to limited shipyard manufacturing capacity."

Maintaining two simultaneous production lines for one model of ship, especially in the same shipyard, is pricey, showing Beijing ranks delivery schedule as more important that cost, Heath said.

"China will pay whatever it takes to get them finished to a specified deadline," he added.

Matching the US Navy



Beijing will pay whatever it takes to stand toe-to-toe with the US Navy, said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.

He said he expects China to build around 20 of the high-end Type 055s and augment them with smaller Type 054 frigates and aircraft carriers in service or under construction to field four carrier battle groups by 2030.

Other shipbuilding is under way for amphibious assault ships -- essentially baby aircraft carriers -- and helicopter platform docks that can move and deploy Marine ground battalions, said Schuster, now a Hawaii Pacific University professor.

And China has been leaking through state media that it's working on things like an electromagnetic pulse cannon, hypersonic aircraft and the most modern of launching systems for its aircraft carriers, he said.

"China is indeed sending the signal that it is both expanding the PLA Navy and equipping it with modern naval combatants equal to that of the US Navy," Schuster said.

The China Daily report said the two Type 55As launched on July 3 would soon begin sea trials, where crew and engineers will make sure everything works as planned.

Those trials have yet to be completed for the two previously launched Type 055s and no estimation was given on when they might actually be ready to be commissioned and join a carrier battle group.

Palestinian officials accused Israel of committing a "horrific massacre" in response to the protests and called on the international community to intervene. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his military's actions, tweeting that "every country has the duty to defend its borders." Israel's military said protesters threw Molotov cocktails, stones and burned tires at Israeli soldiers positioned along the fence separating Israel and Gaza.

__label__world (CNN) An Australian father who lost three children in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 has lashed out at President Donald Trump for his relationship with Russia, on the fourth anniversary of the tragedy.

The plane had been above Ukraine territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists, and investigators in May said the missile had been fired by a Russian brigade. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the incident.

In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Maslin lambasted Trump's unwillingness to condemn Russia, accusing him of ignoring "irrefutable facts."

"That passenger flight MH17 was shot out of the sky and 298 innocent people were murdered is an irrefutable fact," Maslin wrote.

"That the plane was hit by a Russian missile has been proven to be an irrefutable fact."

"That the man whose arse you've just been kissing did this, and continues to lie about it, is an irrefutable fact."

"I miss them I miss them I miss them underlies everything," she wrote of her three children.

"I am Grief. This is me. Grief is me."

Calls for justice

The posts come amid a national outcry in the US over Trump's reluctance to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin over his country's alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election.

At the Helsinki summit on Monday, Trump declined to endorse the US government's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and instead appeared to side with Putin, leading to a wave of criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump shake hands before a meeting in Helsinki, on July 16.

The political controversy came as leaders worldwide spoke out to commemorate the fourth anniversary of MH17 and demand accountability.

The G7 foreign ministers condemned the shooting down "in the strongest possible terms."

"We fully support the work of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), an independent criminal investigation led by the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine," the statement read. "The JIT's findings on Russia's role in the downing of MH17 are compelling, significant and deeply disturbing."

"We are united in our support of Australia and the Netherlands as they call on Russia to account for its role in this incident and to cooperate fully with the process to establish the truth and achieve justice for the victims of MH17 and their next of kin."

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop also issued a statement on Tuesday expressing her condolences to the families of the victims. 38 of the victims on board were Australian.

"On 25 May 2018, Australia and the Netherlands announced that we hold Russia responsible for its role in the downing. We hope that through negotiations with Russia we can open dialogue around the circumstances leading to the tragic loss of innocent lives," Bishop wrote.

"We owe that to the memory of the victims and their families and friends."

The Russian government has repeatedly disputed those allegations, and has suggested instead that Ukrainian forces shot the plane down with either a surface-to-air missile or one of their own fighter jets.
__label__world (CNN) Australia's federal government will consider a "values test" for migrants hoping to gain permanent residence, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday.

The comments follow a speech by Australia's Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs Alan Tudge, warning that the country was veering towards a "separatist multicultural model" as a result of unchecked immigration policies.

Speaking during a trip to Tasmania, Turnbull said that a values test is "one of the issues" currently being debated for new migrants, and repeated previous assertions that Australia is "the most successful multicultural society in the world," according to CNN affiliate 9News

"This is a country where 28% of Australians were born outside Australia, over half have a parent born outside Australia, but isn't it remarkable that we live together in so much harmony because of the values we share?" said Turnbull.

That notion of harmony was called into question Thursday, in a speech delivered by Tudge at the Australia-UK Leadership Forum in London.

Australia's multiculturalism relied on "careful immigrant selection" and "an insistence on immigrant integration," said the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs.

"Our ship is slightly veering towards a European separatist multicultural model and we want to pull it back to be firmly on the Australian integrated path," Tudge said, noting that Australia, like the UK, was facing "ethnic segregation and liberal values being challenged."

Focusing on social cohesion in the age of mass migration, Tudge made numerous comments on European immigration, saying countries had "done too little for too long," and that he is "thankful" Australia doesn't have integration policies like Denmark.

Some of his comments didn't land well with the London audience.

"It's pretty odd that an Australian government minister goes to the UK and talks our country down," said Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese to 9News.

It's not the first time the Turnbull government has acted to tighten Australian immigration. Last year, the prime minister implemented new requirements for permanent residency , including English proficiency and proof that applicants had integrated into Australian society.

Shifting political winds

Turnbull and Tudge's remarks come amid shifting political winds in Europe , where far-right populist parties have risen in influence during the migrant crisis, including the AfD in Germany and the National Front in France.

Like Tudge, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly offered Europe as a bad example of immigration policy.

"I think it has been very bad, for Europe...I just think it is changing the culture," Trump said last week at a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, apparently referring to a wave of refugees who have entered Europe from unstable societies in the Middle East and North Africa.

Not even football has escaped the political turmoil. Earlier this week, South African comedian Trevor Noah got into a back-and-forth with France's ambassador to the US, Gérard Araud, over a joke about the World Cup.

After Noah joked that "Africa won the World Cup," pointing to French players of African heritage, Araud replied that the comment "legitimizes the ideology which claims whiteness as the only definition of being French."

Noah defended his joke, arguing against the notion that "in order to be French, you have to do away with what makes you African."
__label__world (CNN) New Zealand's acting Prime Minister Winston Peters has accused Australia of copying his country's flag, telling its neighbor to get its own design.

"We had a flag that we've had for a long time, copied by Australia," Peters told local network TVNZ on Tuesday.

"They (Australia) should actually change their flag and honor the fact that we got there first with this design," added Peters, who is filling in for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern while she is on maternity leave.

The flags are indeed similar. Both are based on the British ensign, with a dark blue background, a United Kingdom Union Flag in the top left corner and the Southern Cross star constellation.

Among the few distinguishing features is that Australia's stars are white, rather than red and the flag also features an extra star with seven points representing the Australian states and territories.
__label__politics (CNN) A number of potential 2020 Democratic presidential contenders are behind a bill that would allow Puerto Rico to terminate its $73 billion in debt.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, introduced a bill Wednesday that would give the US territory a way out of its crushing debt crisis exacerbated by the damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017.

The US Territorial Relief Act of 2018 includes as cosponsors two other Democratic senators mentioned as prospective 2020 candidates: Kamala Harris, from California, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.

Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-New York -- the first Puerto Rican woman elected to the House -- plans to introduce companion legislation in the House.

The relief act aims to allow US territories to "terminate their public, unsecured debt" if they meet two of the following criteria: population decrease of 5% over 10 years, received major federal disaster assistance and per capita debt going beyond $15,000. Puerto Rico qualifies under these criteria.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Trump administration was warned that ending US protections for more than 300,000 Central Americans would strengthen and grow MS-13 and gangs that President Donald Trump has called "animals ," according to an internal report obtained by CNN.

But the administration went on to end the protections for citizens of El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras and Nicaragua regardless.

The warnings came from experts at the State Department in October 2017, and were attached to a letter from then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to then-acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke.

The State Department also warned that ending the "temporary protected status" program could also hurt US national security and economic interests, including by driving up illegal immigration.

The program covers migrants in the US of countries that have been hit by dire conditions, such as an epidemics, civil war or natural disasters. Previous administrations spanning party had all opted to extend the protections for Central America every roughly two years.

"Many of the deportees would be accompanied by their US-born children, many of whom would be vulnerable to recruitment by gangs," warned the section on Honduras.

"The lack of legitimate employment opportunities is likely to push some repatriated TPS holders, or their children, into the gangs or other illicit employment," warned the section on El Salvador.

"With no employment and few ties, options for those returning to El Salvador and those overwhelmed by the additional competition will likely drive increased illegal migration to the United States and the growth of MS-13 and similar gangs," the report added.

Trump has called MS-13 "animals." "We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in. ... You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people. These are animals," he said in May, later explaining he was speaking about the vicious gang.

The administration says the conditions in each country have improved from the original disaster to the point that the protected status had to end. That has created a precarious legal status for hundreds of thousands of people, many who have been in the US for upwards of two decades and have put down roots.

The documents add to growing evidence that the Department of Homeland Security set aside warnings and concerns about conditions in the countries to end the program.

For Honduras and El Salvador, the analysis notes it "would not be contrary to the U.S. national interest" to let the immigrants stay, saying they were a "stable" population that has "successfully settled" in the US.

DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman noted that the agency made the decision based on legal requirements.

"The decision to terminate temporary protected status was made after a review of country conditions and consultation with the appropriate US government agencies," Waldman said. "Former Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Elaine Duke determined that conditions that supported the designation for TPS no longer existed, and thus, under the law, she was required to terminate TPS. The Department of Homeland Security does not make the law, we enforce it. Should members have concerns with the law, they should seek to amend it."

Administration still recommended ending program

But even as Tillerson himself warned of grave consequences in his letter, with the in-depth analysis by his experts attached, his State Department still recommended the protections be ended.

In ending the program for those four countries, the administration said the law meant its hands were tied.

That was also the finding in the documents. But the career analysts also were clear that regardless of the statute, ending the protections for citizens of those countries would not align with US interests.

"The law really restricts my ability to extend TPS," Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said during a congressional hearing in April. "Some countries remain perhaps unstable and have difficult conditions, but if they are not the result of the originating designation, they must be terminated."

The October 2017 letter and supporting documents are now public as part of a Freedom of Information Act request, and were shared with CNN by the office of Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In a statement, Menendez said the administration is "knowingly putting our national security and the safety of TPS beneficiaries and U.S.-citizen children at risk," and called for it to reverse its decision.

"This document release further confirms how the Trump Administration's reckless anti-immigrant agenda jeopardizes our national security interests in Central America and the safety of TPS beneficiaries and their US citizen children," Menendez said.

In each country's case except Nicaragua, the department analysis recommended a wind-down period of 36 months before protections expired, saying immediate termination would cause the gravest risks. Tillerson recommended 18 months instead, which DHS adopted.

Tillerson in his letter also warned that Central American countries "may take retaliatory actions counter to our long-standing national security and economic interests like withdrawing their counter-narcotics and anti-gang cooperation with the United States, reducing their willingness to accept the return of their deported citizens, or refraining from efforts to control illegal migration."

El Salvador and Honduras "have some of the world's highest homicide rates, and weak law enforcement capabilities" and that the countries have limited economic options for returning nationals," Tillerson added. Those factors "will make it difficult for their respective governments to ensure the protection of returning citizens -- no less the US citizen children who may accompany their parents."

Tillerson was fired as secretary of state in March and has since been replaced by Mike Pompeo.

The documents add to a developing record that the administration seemed committed to ending TPS regardless of the consequences.

In an email from Duke to White House chief of staff John Kelly days after Tillerson's letter, Duke told Kelly she needed another six months to make up her mind on Honduras but assured him her decision would "send a clear signal that TPS in general is coming to a close." Nielsen ended the protections when that time expired.

In the same court filing that revealed that email, a Homeland Security internal intelligence assessment was also made public that found similar concerns to those of the State Department, including that ending the program could actually drive illegal immigration higher, rather than lower.
__label__world (CNN) It gives new meaning to the phrase "a wolf in sheep's clothing." Or in this case, a donkey in zebra stripes.

A zoo in Cairo, Egypt, has been accused of trying to fool visitors by painting zebra stripes onto a donkey, but the zoo director insists the animal is the real thing.

Mahmoud Sarhan, 18, said he was visiting a recently-opened animal sanctuary at the International Garden municipal park when he spotted a strange looking animal.

Sarhan shared this image from his trip on July 21.

Sarhan said several things about the animal stood out and made him suspicious. The black paint had melted on the donkey's face and the ears didn't look like the right size for a zebra, he said.

He posted a picture on his Facebook page, which quickly went viral.

__label__world Osan Air Base, South Korea (CNN) A US Air Force plane carrying what are believed to be the remains of US troops killed during the Korean War some 65 years ago arrived Friday morning at Osan Air Base in South Korea.

Troops from various nations serving in South Korea under the United Nations Command (UNC) presented an honor guard before the plane, as white-gloved troops in different uniforms descended the ramp of the US Air Force C-17, carefully holding cases wrapped in the UN flag.

The cases were transferred to silver minivans waiting on the runway.

A service member at Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, carries a casket containing what is believed to be the remains of a US soldier killed during the Korean War, after it was transported from North Korea.

President Donald Trump said Friday that Vice President Mike Pence will greet the remains of US service members returning to the US.

"These incredible American heroes will soon lay at rest on sacred American soil," Trump said.

The C-17 had left Osan Air Base earlier Friday to fly to the city of Wonsan, North Korea, before completing the return journey, the White House said in a statement.

In Wonsan, North Koreans turned over what they say are an initial 55 cases holding remains, a US official told CNN.

North Korean officials handed over the probable remains on the anniversary of the signing of the armistice that ended the conflict, which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Americans, more than 600,000 Chinese, 600,000 Korean soldiers and more than a million Korean civilians.

It may take months of detailed DNA analysis to determine how many American service members can be identified.

In a tweet, Trump described the return of the remains as a "great moment for so many families," and thanked Kim.

Secretary of Defense James Mattis said Friday that the "coordination effort over the last month" that led to the return of the remains has set a "positive tone for other things, more important things."

The State Department said Saturday that the United States did not give money to North Korea in exchange for the return of the remains.

"Chairman Kim is fulfilling part of the commitment he made to the President to return the remains of our fallen American service members," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told CNN. "This is a tangible step toward the realization of President Trump's and Chairman Kim's agreement in Singapore. US code grants the secretary of defense the authority to reimburse the DPRK, or any other country, for expenses associated with the recovery and storage of remains. In this instance, North Korea did not ask for money and no money was exchanged.‎"

The Remains of American Servicemen will soon be leaving North Korea and heading to the United States! After so many years, this will be a great moment for so many families. Thank you to Kim Jong Un. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2018

Each case of remains was to be opened and photographed in North Korea before being transferred. US forensics specialists are to conduct a more in-depth assessment of the remains, as well as an examination of any military uniform, identification tags or documentation at Osan Air Base. That review could take five days.

"It was a successful mission following extensive coordination," said UNC and US Forces Korea (USFK) commander, Gen. Vincent K. Brooks. "Now, we will prepare to honor our fallen before they continue on their journey home."

Brooks will host a full honors ceremony, on Wednesday, before the remains are flown to a US military laboratory in Hawaii for DNA analysis.

The South Koreans welcomed the move from North Korea as a "humanitarian measure that can help heal the pain of the Korean War veterans who were not able to return home for more than half a century and their bereaved families."

"The South Korean government will continue to consult with the North so that (the remains of) our soldiers killed during the Korean War can return to their families as soon as possible through a joint search for remains," South Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

US service members salute as vehicles carry the remains.

Summit agreement

The return of the remains was one commitment North Korean leader Kim made when he met June 12 with Trump in Singapore.

The transfer had been repeatedly delayed since then. At one point, North Korean officials canceled a meeting with American counterparts to discuss the handover. Even early Friday, there was uncertainty over whether the transfer would occur.

With the return of the remains, the onus shifts to Trump. The North Koreans could now argue that they have begun to fulfill their part of the bargain struck in Singapore and are looking for the United States to move faster to fulfill its portion of the agreement.

"Today, the Chairman is fulfilling part of the commitment he made to the President to return our fallen American service members," the White House statement said. "We are encouraged by North Korea's actions and the momentum for positive change."

"This repatriation is an action based on the agreement between the leaders at the June 12 North Korea-US summit, (we) assess that this is a meaningful step that can contribute to the building of trust between the two sides," said the South Korean Foreign Ministry. "(We) hope the efforts of the involved parties to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula will be further accelerated."

There are thousands of Americans who remain unaccounted for after the war, which began when the North invaded the South in 1950. A number of US war dead are believed to be buried in mass graves in North Korea, not far from the border with the South.

Many US families have been waiting on closure for decades, not knowing what became of their loved ones. Since 1990, North Korea has only repatriated the remains of 340.

"(My father's) bones are still here in the North with the many that died there. That they weren't able to recover," Ruth Hebert, whose father died in the Korean War, told CNN.

Korea was divided into two parts after World War II. After the Japanese surrender, the Soviet Union occupied the area north of the 38th parallel and the United States occupied the south until 1948.

Of the nearly 8,000 Americans who were killed in battle, missing or captured, more than 5,000 of them were believed to be in North Korea.
__label__world (CNN) Polish President Andrzej Duda on Thursday signed into law a controversial judicial reform measure that will make it easier for the nation's ruling party to appoint a new head of the Supreme Court.

The Senate approved the legislation earlier this week, despite opposition from civic rights protesters and the European Union.

Judges applying for posts at the Supreme Court should do so by July 29, Duda said in announcing the signing in a statement on the presidential website.

Poland's governing party -- the Law and Justice Party (PiS) -- earlier this summer pushed through another law requiring Supreme Court judges over the age of 65 to retire, which had the effect of forcing out Chief Justice Malgorzata Gersdorf and more than two dozen other judges.

__label__world (CNN) The militants went from home to home, killing families as they slept, before launching several suicide bombings on Wednesday, targeting a bustling vegetable market as well as government-held positions in the southern Syrian province of Suwayda. When the attackers ran out of ammunition, they detonated their explosive vests.

By the day's end more than 200 people were dead, and 180 wounded, in a gruesome massacre claimed by ISIS.

The coordinated assault -- one of the group's deadliest attacks in Syria for years -- is a chilling reminder that ISIS is far from dead, just a few months after US President Donald Trump suggested the terrorists would soon be gone from Syria for good.

"What happened in the past 48 hours tells us a great deal about the new strategy of the remnants of ISIS. Going from home to home stabbing civilians ... the aim is to inflict as much damage as it is to terrorize," Fawaz Gerges, author of ISIS: A History and professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science, told CNN.

"Even though it has been military defeated on the battlefield, lost its physical caliphate, it still has a few thousand combatants spread worldwide who can carry out spectacular, bloody attacks," he added.

__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, will be the first on the continent to receive Google's free public Wi-Fi service, the company has announced.

The Google Station iniitiative is already live in five countries globally and will connect millions of users via 200 Wi-Fi hotspots spread across five cities in Nigeria within one year, the company said at its Google for Nigeria event Thursday.

Google is not deploying its moonshot Project Loon to provide connectivity, instead, it is partnering with Nigerian fiber optic telecoms service provider 21st Century to roll out Wi-Fi spots at public places such as colleges, malls, markets and bus stations.

The tech giant is not paying the service provider and venue owners for the internet access but they will be sharing ad revenues generated from usage of Google Station.

Google was recently hit with a $5 billion fine by the European Union . The EU fined Google for unfairly pushing its apps on smartphone users and thwarting competitors.

Next billion users

The fast Wi-Fi project is a critical component of the company's Next Billion Users plan to develop products for the next billion internet users, the company said. And the company has its eyes set firmly on emerging markets such as Brazil, Indonesia, India, and Nigeria to get more users online.

The future of the internet is in the hands of the next billion users—the latest generation of internet users to come online on smartphones in places like Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and Nigeria, said Caesar Sengupta, the project lead.

"The next billion users are already changing the internet in three key ways: a mobile-only mindset, an instinct for ubiquitous computing, and a demand for localized content," Sengupta said.

Prior to the Nigeria launch, Google Station service was available in India, Indonesia, Mexico and Thailand.

Google said it needs service providers and venue owners to join as partners before it can launch in other countries on the continent.

To convince prospective partners, Google is offering monetization opportunities to make the project sustainable.

"We are offering new solutions to improve and expand access in Nigeria and across Africa; these launches demonstrate our commitment to Africa through products built to help people in Africa to make the most of the Internet," said Google Nigeria Country Director, Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor.

Nigerian tech experts noted similarities between Google Station and Facebook's Express Wi-Fi, which was launched in Nigeria in November 2017 Express Wi-Fi which is also available in Kenya, Tanzania, India, and Indonesia aims to reduce the cost of internet access.

While Google Station is free, Express Wi-Fi users pay $5.52 for 10GB of data.

At the launch last year, Uche Ofodile, Regional Head of Africa, Express Wi-Fi by Facebook said the initiative aims to reduce barriers to connectivity such as limited infrastructure and high data costs, giving more people, such as small business entrepreneurs and developers, the opportunity to connect and build community.

'Data cost is high'

Nigerian tech developer and senior consultant, Gbolahan Alli believes Google is embarking on the project in Nigeria because its business model depends on internet accessibility.

"Africa is largely an untapped market so it makes sense for them to try to get the next set of billion users by investing in the infrastructure themselves," he tells CNN.

He believes the initiative will benefit Nigerians using the internet for the first time and those that cannot afford Nigeria's high data cost.

According to Web Foundation's 2017 Affordability Report, only 17% of Nigerians with mobile internet users have access to public Wi-Fi, and the cost of a 1GB prepaid data plan is about 8% of a Nigeria's average monthly income while the country's mobile broadband penetration rate is below 12%.

To ensure that its users can access its services in spite of the high data cost, Google also unveiled new apps under its Go initiative targeted at internet users with low bandwidth connections and low-RAM devices.
__label__world (CNN) A ship carrying 40 migrants, including two pregnant women, has been stranded for two weeks in the Mediterranean, after four countries refused it permission to dock.

The Tunisian-flagged offshore supply vessel, the Sarost 5, is currently three kilometers from Zarzis on the southeastern Tunisian coat, the ship's second-in-command, Aymen Ourari, said.

The ship is the latest to be caught up in the diplomatic deadlock over what to do with migrants rescued from the Mediterranean: Malta, France, Italy and Tunisia have all rebuffed requests for it to dock.

Ourari told CNN that if the Sarost is forced to remain at sea, the 14-strong crew foresees "serious incidents" for those on board, who have "about three or four days' worth of food" among them.

The international humanitarian agency the Red Crescent visited the boat Wednesday, Ourari said, describing the situation as a "health crisis."

__label__world (CNN) Kuwaiti social media personality Sondos Alqattan has been dropped by several global cosmetics brands after she uploaded a video slamming new labor laws in the country entitling Filipino domestic workers to a weekly day off.

Recent changes to Kuwaiti regulations for Filipino domestic workers also require that employees be allowed to keep their passports with them. Before the reforms, employers could confiscate the passports of domestic help.

Alqattan, a makeup artist, blasted the new regulations as "pathetic" in a viral video last week.

"For her to take a day off every week, that's four days a month. Those are the days that she'll be out. And we don't know what she'll be doing on those days, with her passport on her," said Alqattan, who has 2.3 million Instagram followers.

Brands distance themselves

On Friday, Japanese cosmetics giant Shiseido told CNN that it did not support Alqattan's recent statements.

"In pursuit of its mission to 'inspire a life of beauty and culture,' Shiseido aims to be an important and trusted corporate entity, accepted by society and consumers worldwide. Shiseido understands that it must respect the human rights of all persons as a prerequisite to conduct business activities for its sustainable growth together with the global society," the company said.

"Shiseido is not currently working with Sondos. We have no plans to work with her again in the future," it added.

Mac Cosmetics told CNN in a statement Friday that it is not currently in partnership with Alqattan and "will no longer be working with her on any brand activities."

Max Factor Arabia said it was "shocked" by Alqattan's comments and emphasized that her remarks did not reflect the values or principles of the brand.

"Max Factor Arabia is taking this incident very seriously and have immediately suspended all collaborations with Sondos," the company said in a statement Wednesday.

A post shared by Max Factor Arabia (@maxfactorarabia) on Jul 24, 2018 at 5:08am PDT

Global haircare brand Phyto described the "cruel comments" as troubling in a statement posted to its Instagram account.

"Soon after finding out about her dreadful actions, we contacted our local distributor in Kuwait and requested that any partnerships with Ms. Alqattan were put to an end effective immediately. We take our brand's values very seriously and will not support such behavior or have it associated with our products," the statement said.

US cosmetics company Anastasia Beverly Hills (ABH) responded to a customer questioning the brand's affiliation with Alqattan on Facebook, writing: "Sondos is not affiliated, employed by, or collaborating with ABH. As a result of her statements, ABH has unfollowed Sondos and removed her from our PR list."

Meanwhile Chelsea Beautique, a London-based makeup company, told a patron on Twitter that the company had removed any videos associated with the Instagram personality.

"We believe that decent working conditions should be provided to everyone and such behavior does not represent our brand's core beliefs," it wrote.

Thank you for sharing your concerns, we've decided to remove the video sponsored by Sondos on our channels. We believe that decent working conditions should be provided to everyone and such behavior does not represent our brand's core beliefs. — Chelsea Beautique (@ChelseaBeautiqu) July 21, 2018

Alqattan yet to apologize

Following the online backlash, Alqattan posted a lengthy statement on Instagram again defending the rights of Kuwaiti employers to retain the passports of domestic employees.

"Due to the spreading rumors it was only necessary to make a responsive clarification. The passport of any expat employee should be in the possession of the employer to protect the employer's interest. Irrelevant of the employee/employer nationality," she wrote.

Alqattan's inflammatory remarks caused an immediate outcry from social media users, many of whom called for others to join them in boycotting any brands known to have collaborative partnerships with the social media influencer.

Social media user Jaja Caringal was harshly critical of Alqattan. "Her expensive stuff and pretty face cannot mask her rotten attitude. Shame on that lady. #sondosalqattan #moderndayslavery," Caringal wrote. Caringal later tweeted that after she sent Alqattan a private message, the Instagram star blocked her on the platform.

Alqattan did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

What's behind Kuwaiti changes?

The reforms to Kuwaiti regulations for Filipino domestic workers were sparked by a diplomatic spat between the Philippines and the Gulf country. The murder of a Filipina maid earlier this year prompted Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte to ban Filipino workers from traveling to Kuwait.

In January, the body of Filipina Joanna Demafelis, 29, was discovered stuffed in the refrigerator of her Lebanese employer and his wife. Kuwaiti authorities have since sentenced the couple to death.

"I will sell my soul to the devil to look for money so that you can come home and live comfortably here," Duterte said after news broke of Demafelis' death. He said he was ready to take "drastic steps" to protect Filipinos working abroad.

Of more than 250,000 Filipinos in Kuwait, at least 60% are domestic workers who live and work in the homes of their employers for more money than they can earn at home.

Kuwait has become a popular overseas destination for Filipino workers in recent years.

More than 55% of Philippines domestic workers live in the Middle East, where an infamous sponsorship system, known as Kefala, dictates their working conditions. Under Kefala, domestic workers cannot leave the country or change jobs without their employers' consent.

Groups such as Human Rights Watch have argued that the system creates a breeding ground for harsh working conditions, and have documented numerous cases of abuse.

Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly paraphrased Mac Cosmetics' statement about whether it had a partnership with Alqattan. Mac Cosmetics said that it is not currently in partnership with Alqattan.
__label__world Jerusalem (CNN) Palestinian teenager Ahed Tamimi has been freed from an Israeli prison after serving an eight-month prison sentence for slapping a soldier, according to a spokesman for Israel's Prison Authority. Tamimi's mother, Nariman Tamimi, was also released.

Early Sunday morning, the two were taken from the HaSharon prison in central Israel to a West Bank border crossing, then on to their village of Nabi Saleh and released.

The young activist received a hero's welcome upon returning home. Video from Nabi Saleh showed dozens of her supporters waved Palestinian flags and cheered for Tamimi, who turned 17 in prison. As she walked through the crowd, many lined up to hug the teenager.

Flanked by her father and mother, Tamimi gave a short statement outside a home in her village, saying, "From our home, the resistance is continuing until the end of the occupation. I thank everyone who supported me during my arrest."

Tamimi then left with her family to Ramallah, where she paid her respects at the grave of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, a family spokeswoman said.

While in Ramallah, she met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidential headquarters, according to official Palestinian news agency Wafa.

Abbas praised Tamimi, describing her as "a model of the Palestinian struggle for freedom, independence and statehood," according to Wafa. Abbas also stressed the need for nonviolent resistance as an "ideal and vital weapon in facing the repression of the Israeli occupation."

During the day, Tamimi also received a call from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who praised her "bravery and determination," according to Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency.

Following the visit to Ramallah, she returned to Nabi Saleh to address the media. Tamimi promised "our resistance will continue, especially our resistance for equality and human rights."

Tamimi, who finished her high school studies while in prison, said she intended to study law at university so that she could "bring up the case of the [other] detainees to the entire world and in international courts." Asked if she would slap a soldier again, Tamimi said, "I can't predict the future. Maybe tomorrow Palestine might be free and I can't define what'll happen in the future. I hope that the occupation goes away so that I don't think about doing this again."

"I've never lived under peace," Tamimi concluded. "This is why I see peace as something important."

In a statement sent via text message to CNN, Tamimi's lawyer, Gabi Lasky, an Israeli attorney who often represents Palestinian defendants, said: "After 8 months, it's clear that Ahed's arrest and punishment had more to do with politics rather than legal issues. Ahed's trial heightened the folly of the occupation. Arrests of minors in the military court are not the right tool to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I hope our leaders will be courageous enough to reach an agreement and free us all from the chains of occupation."

Tamimi was arrested on December 19 after a video showed her slapping and kicking an Israeli soldier in Nabi Saleh. The video, shot by members of her family during weekly protests, shows the soldier pushing her away. The incident, which happened on December 15, occurred shortly after a soldier gravely wounded her 15-year-old cousin nearby by shooting him in the head with a rubber bullet.

Her mother was arrested one day later on suspicion of incitement when she went to inquire about her daughter in jail.

At the time, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said: "Whoever goes wild during the day, will be arrested at night. Not only the girls and the parents but others around will not escape punishment." Israeli officials have not commented since her release.

In March, Tamimi agreed to plead guilty to four charges, including disrupting a soldier and incitement, in exchange for an eight-month prison sentence. Eight of the 12 charges against her were dropped. Tamimi's mother pled guilty to charges of incitement and disrupting a soldier.

Tamimi rocketed to fame in 2012 when a video of her holding up her fist to an Israeli soldier went viral. Since then, her fame has only increased. She has become a hero to many Palestinians, who see her as standing up to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.

On Saturday evening, Israeli police arrested three people -- two Italians and a Palestinian -- who were painting a large mural of Tamimi on the separation barrier near Bethlehem in preparation for the teen's release.

One of the Italians, Agostino Chirwin, is famous for creating giant realistic murals of politicians, activists, and other figures. On his Instagram page under the name "joritagoch," he posted a picture of a border police car with a message "We are in arrest in [Bethlehem] from Israeli army. Who can help us please do it".

Tamimi's case has become a lightning rod for criticism of the Israeli military, the military court system, and its treatment of Palestinian youth.

"Israel's jailing of a child for eight months -- for calling for protests, and slapping a soldier -- reflects the discrimination, complete absence of due process, and ill-treatment of children endemic in Israel's military justice system. Ahed Tamimi is now free, but hundreds of Palestinian children remain locked up with little attention on their cases," said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch.
__label__world (CNN) The ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) has declared victory in Sunday's general election, a result which opponents condemned as a "sham" following a months-long crackdown on the press and the suppression of the leading opposition party.

CPP, led by Prime Minister Hun Sen, won more than 100 of the 125 seats in Parliament, a party spokesman said.

The country's leading opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), was effectively barred from running in Sunday's vote after a court ruled late last year that top members of the party were conspiring with foreigners to stage a revolution.

The CNRP's leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested in September on charges of treason and is still behind bars.

"29 July 2018 marked the death of democracy in Cambodia (and) a new dark day of its history," Sochua Mu, the vice president of the CNRP, said during a news conference in Jakarta, Monday. Sitting beside her was Kem Monovithya, Kem Sokha's daughter.

__label__world (CNN) China has charged the country's former internet czar and top censor with bribery, capping a dramatic fall from the heights of political power.

Lu Wei "accepted a large number of bribes" during his time as national propaganda chief, head of the Cyberspace Administration of China, deputy head of the official Xinhua news agency, and as a Beijing city official, according to state media

The charges come after Lu was expelled from the Communist Party and dismissed from public office in February, which followed a sudden fall from favor in mid 2016 , when he left his position at the Cyberspace Administration.

At that time, some speculated Lu was destined for even higher office, such was his perceived connection to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who consistently promoted Lu during earlier periods in his career.

But it soon became apparent the censor had fallen from favor, and an official corruption investigation was announced just weeks before the opening of the 2017 World Internet Conference, a gathering of China's top government officials and industry leaders seen as his brainchild.

Chinese President Xi Jinping (middle) talks with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg (right) as Lu Wei, China's Internet czar, looks on during a gathering of CEOs and other executives at the main campus of Microsoft Corp September 23, 2015 in Redmond, Washington.

Rise to the top

Short and stocky, with a wide smile and larger-than-life presence, Lu, who was born in 1960, started his climb through the ranks of China's propaganda and censorship apparatus at Xinhua, which he joined as a regional correspondent in the 1990s.

By 2001, he was the news agency's secretary general, and would become its vice president within three years. According to some reports, he was an ally of former Premier Wen Jiabao and responsible in part for crafting his man-of-the-people "Grandpa Wen" image.

Leaked US state department cables from his time as Xinhua showed Lu arguing aggressively for Chinese "sovereignty" on media issues, something he would expand on as Xi's internet tzar.

After a brief stint overseeing propaganda and publicity for the Beijing government, Lu joined the state council in 2013 and later the newly created Cyberspace Administration of China.

In these roles, he oversaw a crackdown on Weibo, the Chinese Twitter-like platform, reigning in powerful thought leaders and celebrities known as the "Big Vs" for their "verified" status.

In a meeting with several leading commentators, Lu laid out " seven bottom lines ," including upholding socialist ideals, for Weibo posters to follow. Those who refused, or later overstepped, were banned from the platform or even faced criminal prosecution.

Lu took a similarly strident line with foreign internet companies, despite the best efforts of tech billionaires like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to court him.

Under Xi and Lu, China has advanced the "doctrine of cyberspace sovereignty," a dramatic reimagining of how the internet works , which would see the global, open internet turned into an overlapping collection of national internets, each with their own rules and tightly policed borders.

This approach has attracted considerable support from other autocratic regimes. China's top tech firms have gone on to sell foreign governments the tools for building their own firewalls, and top officials provided expertise.

China has one of the world's most tightly controlled internets, and has begun exporting its controls overseas.

Fall from power

While much of what happens within the world of elite Chinese politics is a black box to those on the outside, what is clear is that Lu fell out of grace with Xi, potentially because he had built up a separate powerbase and was seen to be preparing for a future succession battle, when and if Xi himself steps down

In a withering broadside against Lu following his expulsion, the Party's corruption watchdog said Lu "did whatever he wanted, commenting on central government policies with bias and distortion, obstructing central government investigations, with his growing ambition he used public tools for personal interests and did whatever it took for personal fame."

Though a trial date has yet to be set, given China's almost 100% conviction rate, it is practically certain Lu faces years in prison, a dramatic shift from his days schmoozing in Silicon Valley.
__label__world Paris (CNN) A man has been caught on video forcefully slapping a woman after he allegedly sexually harassed her on the streets of Paris.

The man is seen walking by a streetside cafe when he picks up an ashtray from a table and throws it over customers' heads in the woman's direction. He then comes face to face with her, waving his hands, before striking a blow and turning around to walk away.

The woman, Marie Laguerre, posted CCTV footage of the incident on her Facebook account, saying that she was on her way home on Tuesday last week when the man started whistling and making noises at her, and said "dirty words that were humiliating and provocative as I passed by him."

"Bad luck, he was not the first one that day and I was tired. So I said 'shut up' as I walked away," she wrote. "Because I do not tolerate this kind of behavior. I cannot shut up and we must not shut up."

She described how the man threw the ashtray at her and started following her.

__label__world (CNN) Sitting alone outside a ramshackle caravan in Jordan's Zaatari Refugee Camp, Mohamed Jokhadar sips coffee from a stained cup and reflects.

Jokhadar is a Syrian refugee who, like so many refugees around the world, was violently torn from the life he once knew by civil war. Living in a refugee camp, he had to face reality. "I came to the realization that I'm here and I'm not leaving," he says.

Syrian refugee Mohamed Jokhadar in front of a mural he painted at the Zaatari Camp in Jordan.

Amid the canvas tents, temporary buildings and lost hope, Jokhadar chose to embrace his new life and seize opportunities within the camp.

Today, he not only owns a barber shop, but operates as an artist who chronicles the horrors unfolding in his homeland.

Refugee crisis

The Zaatari Refugee Camp, in Mafraq Governorate, opened in 2012 to host Syrians, like Jokhadar, fleeing military conflict in their country. Today, it is home to approximately 80,000 Syrian refugees, according to the UNHCR.

Zaatari Refugee Camp, located to the north-east of the Jordanian capital, Amman.

There are 68.5 million people worldwide who have been forcibly displaced, according to the UNHCR, and the increasing number of refugees, internally displaced people and asylum-seekers is mainly being driven by the war in Syria , the body said in 2014.

The Zaatari Refugee Camp, however, is no longer the desolate, foreboding place it once was. In just six years, it has been transformed from a barren tract of land into a bustling metropolis, thanks to its inhabitants' talent, zeal and determination to build a real community.

Tough choices

Jokhadar, aged 32, and his family were forced to leave their home in the city of Homs, in 2012, after extreme shelling overtook the city.

Syrian Mohamed Jokhadar painting on a caravan, adding some color to the Zaatari Refugee Camp.

At first, they moved within Syria. "We thought we'd stay in an area close to the Syrian border until the situation in Homs got calmer," he says. But it never did.

In January 2013, Jokhadar entered the Zaatari Camp on foot with his wife and nine-month-old daughter. He was accompanied by his elderly parents, his brother and sister-in-law, and their three children. Two years later, Jokhadar's wife gave birth to a son inside the camp.

"I knew living in a refugee camp would be hard," he says. "But you reach a point where you need to choose between a hard life or, God forbid, losing a member of your family."

A change in style

In Syria, Jokhadar had worked in the family construction business, but his passion was always art. In fifth grade, his art teacher had encouraged him to embrace his creative side. "She told me I was destined to become a painter," he says.

Jokhadar began painting at his home in Homs for hours every day; sometimes from dusk until dawn. His paintings were filled with rich colors, and his specialty was portraits of beautiful, hopeful faces.

Now as a refugee, Jokhadar has sought self-expression and solace through his art -- although he says the war has affected his style and his color palette.

"I began wanting to say something through my art, to send a message," he says. "I was living a hard life and I wanted to illustrate it through my paintings."

In the camp, Jokhadar began volunteering as an art teacher at one of the schools. However, to make a living, he bought a barber shop the day after he entered the Zaatari Camp. He works there every afternoon, but is always happiest with a paintbrush in his hand.

While Jokhadar's staff look after customers, he paints in a corner of the shop. Customers are often intrigued by his activity, and many have asked if they can join him in his art corner.

Now, when he's not trimming someone's beard, he is teaching another refugee the basics of art.

Against all odds

Jokhadar is not the only refugee bringing creativity into the Zaatari Camp. Safwan Harb, for example, is a 28-year-old refugee from Daraa, south-west Syria, who entered the Zaatari Camp in 2013.

As a child, he was diagnosed with polio and lost control of his lower limbs, but that hasn't stopped him from seizing opportunities in the camp.

In 2014, Harb and his brother founded the Syrian Art Group, which currently consists of 30 members, who organize plays and train others how to act, produce and write scripts. The group has performed on several occasions around the camp.

"The Syrian Art Group is like a family to me," Harb says. "It allowed us all to discover our passions and build a long-lasting support network."

Paul Fean is the Norwegian Refugee Council's (NRC) acting youth specialist in Jordan, who works to help young refugees gain skills and build relationships.

He says Harb and Jokhadar are representative of the entrepreneurial, creative spirit found in refugee camps.

"In my experience working with refugees," Fean says, "I've found a strong motivation, interest and desire to make a better future for themselves, their families and their communities."

He says one camp he's worked in gained electricity because of refugees who taught themselves how to weld. Communities within another camp were able to become mobile, because refugees rehabilitated old bicycles and distributed them around the camp.

"Refugees have a lot of skill and potential that they can draw on," Fean says. "They just need opportunities and our support."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton is getting more involved in the 2018 midterms.

Clinton, through her political organization Onward Together, donated the maximum of $5,000 to 19 Democratic House candidates and four secretary of state candidates in June, according to the group's filings with the Federal Election Commission. The donations represent the most concentrated midterm effort the former Democratic presidential nominee has made to date and further thrust Clinton into an election that will be the most potent judgment on Trump since he defeated her two years earlier.

Eleven of the House candidates who received donations from Clinton are vying to flip districts represented by Republicans in Congress that she won in 2016.

Representatives from Clinton's team and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee worked together to target which candidates Clinton should back to stay in line with the party's 2018 strategy, officials with both groups tell CNN.

While the former Democratic nominee has publicly endorsed Democrats on the ballot in November, she has yet to publicly hit the campaign trail and has largely kept her distance from 2018 campaign politics. One reason is strategic: Republicans are eager to tie Democratic candidates, especially those running in districts that lean Republican, to national figures like Clinton, a fact people close to the former secretary of state is well aware of.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The House playing field just keeps tilting toward Democrats as the November midterm election creeps ever closer.

With just 99 days left in the 2018 cycle, Democrats appear poised to retake the House majority they lost in the 2010 election, according to a new analysis by CNN's own Terence Burlij.

The math goes like this: Democrats need to net 23 Republican-controlled seats to win the majority. At the moment, CNN rates 11 Republican-held seats as "leaning Democratic" or worse for the GOP. Let's assume those 11 seats go for Democrats.

Now, we are down to only 12 additional pickups for Democrats to win the majority. Take a gander at the "toss-up" ratings in the chart above. Of the 27 seats currently rated as "toss-ups" by CNN, Republicans control 25 of them. If Democrats win just under half -- 12 -- of those GOP seats, they are back in the majority. (Traditionally, one party tends to win the vast majority of the "toss-up" races because House contests -- particularly very close ones -- tend to be heavily affected by the national mood. And the national mood typically favors one side at the end of an election.)

The other math problem for Republicans -- aside from the large amount of vulnerability they carry in seats they currently hold -- is how few opportunities they have of picking off Democratic seats. CNN rates only 13 Democratic seats as competitive at all -- with just two "toss-ups" and four that lean in Democrats' favor. There are zero Democratic-held seats where Republicans are currently favored.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Marc Short, the former White House legislative affairs director and recently hired CNN contributor, predicted on Monday there would not be a government shutdown ahead of the midterm elections.

"There are two different timetables here," Short said on CNN's "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."

He continued, "One is September 30, which I fully expect you'll have a continuing resolution that gets us till December. I think the time frame we're talking about is if Congress hasn't provided the funding by the end of the year in December."

Short left the White House earlier this month after announcing the news to staff in June.

Short's comments came after President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that he would be willing to force the government into a shutdown if Congress did not appropriate money for his proposed border wall, which he promised Mexico would pay for, and change the nation's immigration laws. In comments on Monday, Trump repeated his threat , saying he would "leave room for negotiation" but insisting Congress pass new border security and immigration measures.

__label__world (CNN) Every year we ask Santa Claus to bring us something nice, and this Christmas he could be giving a lucky person a $8.2 million home in London.

The catch? You must enter a drawing for $17.

Melanie and Nigel Walsh, listed their home for sale earlier this year, but due to the difficult property market, Brexit , and high property taxes, a creative approach to find a way to sell the home was needed.

"Not many people are willing to pay the Stamp Duty fee that comes with such a large home," Melanie Walsh told CNN, referring to a point-of-sale tax in England on property or land over a certain price.

"It could be up to 12% of the home value, but by entering our home in this contest, we can include the fees, so the person who wins won't have to pay it."

A half acre lake stocked with over 2,000 fish sits on the home's backyard.

The couple created what they like to call "a competition" on June 16, to find a new owner, and it's open to anyone worldwide willing pay the 13.5-pound ($17 and change) entry fee.

What makes this house exquisite besides the captivating half acre lake that sits on its backyard, and the very provocative wine room, is the rich history it holds.

First built in the 1500's and located 14 miles from the heart of London, the home served as a stop for Queen Elizabeth I prior to her becoming queen in 1558, says Melanie.

The queen's pit stop was later demolished and rebuilt in 1700s, and was given the name "Dancers Hill House."

Which is why the couple decided to include a very important question that must be answered correctly to become a finalist to win the home:

"Who was the reigning Monarch on Christmas Day, the year the Dancers Hill House was built?"

Melanie and Nigel Walsh hope the winner loves the home as much as they have.

The couple first bought the house for $1.5 million nearly 30 years ago, and they remodeled it drastically.

"Because it was abandoned, when we first bought the home there were so many holes in the roof we had to sign our contract under umbrellas," Melanie says.

After retiring, and with all their children now married, the six-bedroom, six-bathroom home is just too big for the couple.

"The house has many memories, and it means a lot to us. We used the house for big parties, and our son had his wedding here," said Melanie.

For just $17 you could become a master chef in this state-of-the-art kitchen.

The winner will be randomly chosen in mid-December if the Walshes have met the $8.2 million goal in ticket sales by then. If not, the contest will be extended for another six months.

"I couldn't tell you how many tickets have been bought so far," said Melanie. "But I know one person bought a total of 80 tickets at once."

Melanie hopes the winner will cherish the home as much as they have. As for the winning answer to the question, they want everyone who enters to do their own research.
__label__world Seoul, South Korea (CNN) Police are investigating a South Korean company that claimed to have discovered a sunken Russian warship with $8.9 billion worth of gold on board.

South Korean police are investigating the firm, called Shinil Group, for possible fraudulent claims and have banned senior company staff members from leaving the country, a police spokesman told CNN on Tuesday.

The company announced earlier this month that it had found the Dmitri Donskoii, a 5,800-ton Russian warship that had sunk during the 1905 Battle of Tsushima, in the waters between present-day South Korea and Japan.

A picture supplied by the Shinil Group of the sunken ship.

The company originally said that previous reports had estimated the ship contained up to $134 billion worth of gold, but lowered that figure in a press conference on July 26.

Following the announcement, share prices for Jeil Steel Manufacturing Co. surged on the South Korean stock market, though Jeil Steel said it had nothing to do with the discovery.

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump seems to believe that Rudy Giuliani is a really, really good surrogate for him when it comes to fighting back against the ongoing special counsel probe into Russia's attempted interference in the 2016 election. What else could explain Giuliani's ubiquity on cable television?

Which brings me to Monday morning and a thrill-ride of a performance by Giuliani on CNN's "New Day." There was so much said in the interview that condensing it all into one news story is truly impossible. So, below, I've picked out the 37 oddest lines from the Giuliani sit-down.

1. "It's good, it's attention-grabbing."

This is Donald Trump 101 -- and expert channeling of the boss by Giuliani. Context: CNN's Alisyn Camerota is asking Giuliani to provide any sort of evidence of the conflict of interest that Trump alleges -- in a tweet -- that special counsel Robert Mueller has toward him. Giuliani is in the process of dodging the question when he throws in this encomium to Trumpism.

2. "When you're getting beaten up by all kinds of anonymous tweets you know are coming from Lanny Davis and Cohen..."

If the tweets are anonymous than how can he know who they are coming from? Wheels within wheels.

3. "Mueller, stand up and be a man."

"He's a patriot, a good man, served his country -- did a good job with the FBI. I don't think he would be affected by malice or prejudice." -- Rudy Giuliani on Robert Mueller, May 2018

4. "I can't tell you. I'm not sure exactly what the conflict is. I have a good idea of what it is -- it's one that would have kept me out of the investigation."

So. Giuliani doesn't know what the conflict of interest that Mueller has in regard to Trump. But it's definitely bad! (Also we do know of one alleged conflict: Mueller left as a member of a Trump golf club in Virginia -- and Trump insists there was some debate over whether Mueller's dues would be refunded.)

5. "Mueller hasn't contributed to a Republican, he worked for Obama and worked for Republicans."

Wait, wait. So, Bob Mueller is a Democrat? The Bob Mueller who was appointed as FBI director by George W. Bush? The Bob Mueller who was chosen as special counsel by Donald Trump's deputy attorney general? The Bob Mueller who Fox News called the "only Republican" on the special counsel team? That guy? Um, OK.

6. "Andrew Weissmann, you know who Andrew Weissmann is -- he's a complete scoundrel."

Weissman is the member of Mueller's team prosecuting former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- a trial which starts on Tuesday. (Weissman is also tasked with investigating deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates, who had pleaded guilty and is now cooperating with the special counsel probe.) Weissman was previously an assistant US attorney in New York, focused on organized crime and Wall Street wrongdoing. His sin, in the eyes of Giuliani, is that he donated money to Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 201 6. So, "scoundrel."

7. "It's up to the President to describe it in further detail if he elects to do so. Or if Mueller would like to explain why it's not a conflict, I invite Bob to do it."

Follow this logic if you dare: Trump alleges a business conflict of interest with Mueller but doesn't elaborate. Giuliani refuses to do so either but does note that it's on Mueller to reveal this alleged conflict of interest. Perfect!

8. "It's Mueller who possibly hasn't disclosed the conflict."

"Possibly hasn't disclosed." So we have an allegation of a conflict of interest from Trump. We have no details offered by either the President or his lawyer. And we have his lawyer admitting that Mueller may not have disclosed this alleged conflict.

9. "I think he was hoping maybe it had passed Mueller by or maybe he had he gotten over it."

Why didn't Trump or anyone around him raise this allegedly glaring conflict of interest about Mueller around the time he was appointed special counsel last spring? Because Trump, consistent with what we know about him, was trying to give Mueller the benefit of the doubt about getting over his grudge. Yeah, yeah, that's the ticket.

10. "We have 183 unique tape recordings."

There are 182 other conversations that one-time Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen secretly recorded!?! Holy moly.

11. "Cohen always goes too far, and when you're lying, there's always a trap for you. He said there was a one-on-one meeting that Donald Jr. came in and told him about the meeting was about to take place."

along with several others, when Trump was informed of the Russians' offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen's account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources." I've not seen Cohen claim there was a "one-on-one meeting" between President Trump and his son, Don Jr., where the information about a planned meeting with the Russians in June 2016 was passed. This is how CNN broke the news of Cohen's story contradicting the Trumps' account (emphasis mine): "Cohen alleges that he was present,when Trump was informed of the Russians' offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen's account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources."

12. "Also in all of these months and all of these tapes, [Cohen's] never said it. And all of a sudden it appears now when he's maybe going to go to jail and singing for himself."

Fair point here by Giuliani. The timing of when Cohen has decided to make clear he not only knows Trump is lying about the Russia meeting but that he is willing to tell Mueller all about it is suspicious because of his own perceived legal peril.

13. "We're being aimed at by a -- luckily, not a very artful liar -- but a liar."

"I do not expect that Michael Cohen is going to lie." -- Rudy Giuliani , July 2018

14. "What I think and what I know may be two different things."

15. "I know how convinced he is that he didn't do anything wrong and wants to explain it and I've seen other people get into trouble thinking that, innocent people."

The "why" behind Giuliani's much-stated opposition to Trump talking to Mueller? He's afraid Trump, who is totally innocent, might "get into trouble." Do tell...

16. "I guess the judgment's out."

That's Giuliani on Mueller on Monday. Here's Giuliani on Mueller last month : "He's a patriot, a good man, served his country -- did a good job with the FBI. I don't think he would be affected by malice or prejudice."

17. "We're going to do obstruction by tweet on a President of United States as an article of impeachment?"

"Obstruction by tweet" is a terrific phrase.

18. "And [Mueller] has no incriminating information incriminating of the President."

This is the least incriminating incrimination that has ever incriminated.

19. "I mean that just -- four months, they are not going to be colluding about Russians which I'm not -- I don't even know if that's a crime, colluding about Russians."

A remarkable piece of goalpost-moving by Giuliani here. Trump has spent the last year yelling "no collusion." Now, his personal attorney is saying that even if there was collusion it isn't a crime? Riiiiiight.

20. "You start analyzing the crime. The hacking is the crime."

Well, no. The issue is the widespread attempt by Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. Yes, the hacking into Democratic email accounts is part of the broader picture. But it's not the full broader picture.

21. "Nobody can be sure of anything."

Wise words, Rudy. And true!

22. "I have to say sorry, I made a mistake, the guy is unethical, he's a scumbag, he's a horrible person."

Scratch Giuliani off the Cohen family holiday card list!

23. "I can be on all day if you wanted."

This is the lead lawyer for a man who has made his political career by insisting the media is fake and dying. And yet, both Giuliani and his client seem to love cable TV...

24. "I just need a little coffee."

Same.

25. "George Washington would have said that about Benedict Arnold at a certain point of time."

Two things here. First, Giuliani is using a historical comparison in which he is George Washington in an attempt to explain his previously positive statements about Cohen. Second, go read " Valiant Ambition: George Washington, Benedict Arnold and the fate of the American Revolution ." It is amazing.

26. "[Trump] turned out to have a close friend betray him like Iago betrayed Othello, and Brutus put the last knife into Caesar -- I think they both trusted those people."

Much like Peter Pettigrew betrayed Sirius Black and James and Lily Potter!

27. "I can't tell you whether he would pardon him."

Amazing! Giuliani has spent minute after minute running down Michael Cohen as the world's biggest liar and scumball. And yet, he won't rule out Trump pardoning Cohen!

28. "I'm not denigrating Michael Cohen's character."

HA HA HA HA HAHA ... wait, Giuliani is serious.

29. "I've practiced law for a long time, if you tape record your client and lie to your client about (it), you have no character. You forfeited your character."

"I'm not denigrating Michael Cohen's character." -- Rudy Giuliani, in, literally, the last sentence.

30. "I just know that you don't do that with a tape and expect that it's going to be admitted into evidence."

Giuliani is making the case here that the secretly recorded tape of Trump and Cohen talking about former Playboy model Karen McDougal shouldn't even be part of the Mueller investigation. His argument isn't that it's been doctored. Only that the tape cuts off. But the insinuation is clear.

31. "More likely is, he came back home, he erased the portion that he wanted erased and then he tried to tape record a conversation that appears with Don Jr., might have gotten that too, and then he erased that."

To be clear: Giuliani has zero evidence Cohen did this. He might have! But Giuliani is simply throwing this chum in the water , knowing the conspiracy-minded among Trump's base will seize on it.

32. "Alisyn, come on, be fair, they weren't talking about the Playboy model."

33. "He was doctoring tapes. He doctored at the word 'check' he cut the tape off. That's called doctoring a tape."

That depends on what the meaning of "doctoring" is.

34. "It's a horrible thing that Mueller is doing."

"He's a patriot, a good man, served his country -- did a good job with the FBI. I don't think he would be affected by malice or prejudice." -- Giuliani, two months ago

35. "No, it's starting to get useless."

"I can be on all day if you wanted." -- Giuliani, moments before

36. "I'll be here with my version of the report and they'll have their version of the report and the American people, in that sense, are going to decide it."

This is absolutely key as to what Trump and Giuliani are -- and have been -- working at. Yes, Mueller will issue a report. But, Giuliani and Trump will issue their rebuttal in an attempt to undermine whatever the Mueller report says. Because they view discrediting Mueller -- a former FBI chief -- as an absolutely necessary step in "winning" this fight. Which, in case you forgot, is about Russia's active interference in the 2016 election and the country's plan to do it again.

37. "It was worth it."

Was it? Really?
__label__world (CNN) The head of Malaysia's civil aviation authority resigned Tuesday after a report on missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370 showed failures by Kuala Lumpur's air traffic control center.

Malaysian authorities said Monday they had failed to determine the cause of the 2014 disappearance of the aircraft, but highlighted lapses by air traffic control in complying with operating procedures -- without suggesting they were to blame for its loss.

Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM), said in a statement that while the report did not fault the Department of Civil Aviation, there was evidence Kuala Lumpur Air Traffic Control Center "did not comply with certain Standard Operating Procedures".

"Over the past four years, I have tried my level best to assist in the search for MH370 and I am ever resolute in finding answers we all seek towards this unfortunate tragedy as we owe it to the families and loved ones," he said. "I am saddened to have to leave under these circumstances."

His resignation will take effect in 14 days.

__label__politics (CNN) For years, many Republicans and anti-tax advocates have pushed for a change to the way that investment taxes are calculated.

They may get their wish. Steven Mnuchin told the New York Times that the administration is considering whether it can use its regulatory powers to let investors account for the effect of inflation when calculating how much their investments have grown. Treasury is evaluating the economic impact and the process through which it can be achieved, according to a Treasury spokesperson.

When investors sell stocks or other assets subject to capital gains, they are taxed on the difference between what they receive for the sale and what they paid for it originally. That tax rate is usually 20%, which is lower than the rate people are taxed on their income.

By adjusting capital gains to adjust for inflation, the White House could cut the tax bills for the nation's wealthiest investors by billions of dollars a year.

For example, if an investor bought $100,000 of stock in 1987 right after the stock market crash that year, that stock could easily be worth about $1.4 million today. The tax would be calculated on the $1.3 million gain, which would mean the investor would owe more than $250,000 in capital gains taxes if he or she sold the stock. But adjusting for inflation, a process known as indexing, the original $100,000 cost of the stock would be estimated to be more than $200,000, saving the taxpayer more than $20,000 in taxes.

__label__politics (CNN) On Monday, LeBron James sat down for an interview with CNN's Don Lemon to promote a new public school that his charitable foundation -- along with the Akron school system -- helped build. In the interview. James and Lemon talked about race, President Donald Trump and the state of the country.

It's worth checking out the entire interview -- it's only 15 minutes long -- but one line from James in it really jumped out at me. Asked by Lemon whether life was harder as an African-American living during Trump's presidency, LeBron responded: "No, I think it's always been there, but I think the President in charge now has given people -- they don't care now. They throw it in your face now."

That's an important insight from James -- and something that the debate that rages over whether Trump is actually racist or not misses. In some ways, it doesn't matter whether Trump is actually a racist. What matters is how his actions both provide cover for those who hold bigoted views and also serve as a sort of encouragement for these sorts of noxious views to be aired publicly.

Do I know that Trump's "both sides" reaction in the wake of the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, was born out of some sort of inchoate racism? No, I don't. But what I do know is that equating peaceful protesters with white supremacists emboldens those who hold bigoted views. It affords them some semblance of credibility; the President said the counterprotesters were just as responsible as we are for this violence!

And, I don't know that Trump's baffling unwillingness to distance himself from Klansman David Duke during the 2016 campaign -- Trump initially suggested he wasn't familiar enough with Duke to offer an opinion about his endorsement -- is the result of a deep-seated racism within the President. But I do know that by not forcefully condemning Duke from the get-go, Trump allowed the likes of Duke to appropriate his message and his campaign for their purposes.

__label__politics (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller has referred a collection of cases to New York federal prosecutors concerning whether several high-profile American lobbyists and operatives failed to register their work as foreign agents, according to people familiar with the matter.

The transfer of the inquiries marks an escalation of Mueller's referrals to the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in the period since he turned over a case involving President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen.

Since the spring, Mueller has referred matters to SDNY involving longtime Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta and his work for his former firm, the Podesta Group, and former Minnesota Republican Rep. Vin Weber and his work for Mercury Public Affairs, the sources said.

One source said that former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, a former partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, is also part of the inquiry.

None of the entities involved have been charged with wrongdoing, and there is no indication the SDNY inquiry will result in criminal charges.

It's not clear whether they are considered one case or separate matters, these people said, though all involve inquiries into whether the men improperly performed work on behalf of groups associated with Ukraine without registering with the Justice Department as foreign agents.

Federal law requires that an entity representing a foreign political party or government file public reports detailing the relationship.

At least one of the matters, involving Podesta, was referred to SDNY by Mueller's team shortly before the FBI executed searches of Cohen's home, office and hotel room in early April, according to the sources, though there is no sign that the timing was related to the Cohen investigation. It couldn't be determined if the other matters were referred at the same time.

It's also not clear exactly why Mueller referred the matters to federal prosecutors in New York. Both Mercury and Skadden have offices in Manhattan, though Weber and Craig are based in Washington, DC, and performed the work in question while based in offices there. Podesta and his former firm are also based in Washington. SDNY, however, could claim jurisdiction for reasons such as the location of banking transactions associated with the activity under examination.

Mueller has come under scrutiny from Trump and others for what they perceive as the special counsel's examination of matters beyond the scope of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election cycle, and Mueller's referral of cases that aren't closely linked to that central matter could be a way of insulating the special counsel probe from such backlash, people familiar with the situation said.

A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the US attorney's office declined to comment.

A representative for Podesta and the Podesta Group declined to comment.

An attorney for Weber, who led Mercury's Ukraine-linked lobbying work, declined to comment.

"We welcome any inquiry, as we always have, since we acted appropriately at every step of the process, including hiring the best lawyer in Washington we could and following his advice," said Michael McKeon, a partner at Mercury.

Craig declined to comment. Skadden declined to comment.

Mueller had been scrutinizing all three firms as part of his inquiry into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Rick Gates, who were both charged by the special counsel's office with failing to file as foreign agents relating to a decade of work they did for the Party of Regions, a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine.

Manafort, who pleaded not guilty and faces trial on the matter in September, and Gates, who pleaded guilty, paid the Mercury and Podesta firms through a nonprofit, European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, for work that was subsequently revealed to have been done on behalf of Ukraine's government, according to court filings.

Mueller had been examining whether Mercury and the Podesta Group properly identified to federal authorities their foreign advocacy for the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, CNN previously reported. The ECFMU is a Brussels-based nonprofit group that federal prosecutors have called a mouthpiece for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians.

The Podesta Group has said it was fully cooperating with the special counsel's office and said it didn't register as a foreign agent for its ECFMU work because that group had misrepresented itself. The Podesta Group said it registered its work for ECFMU instead with Congress, based on what it said was faulty information the non-profit had provided and an outside legal opinion on the matter. The ECFMU had given the firm a statement attesting that it wasn't an arm of a foreign government, the Podesta Group said.

The Podesta Group said previously that it retroactively filed a disclosure after discussions with the Department of Justice.

Skadden performed its own work for Ukraine and also advised Mercury on whether it needed to register its work under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

Gates admitted as part of his cooperation deal that he had misled Skadden regarding whether the nonprofit was linked to the Ukraine government, a step he knew would avoid triggering Mercury and the Podesta Group to register their work under the FARA statute, according to court filings.

Mercury, too, submitted retroactive FARA filings.

Another former Skadden lawyer, Alex van der Zwaan, pleaded guilty in February to lying to the special counsel's office, admitting that he misled investigators about his discussions related to Skadden's work for the former president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, in preparing a report on the trial of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.

Court filings say that after one of the discussions van der Zwaan lied about, he called the senior partner at Skadden who worked on the report and partially recorded that call. The court papers didn't name the senior partner, but van der Zwaan's attorney identified the partner in a court proceeding as Craig.

The special counsel prosecutor involved in that proceeding, Andrew Weissmann, said in court that van der Zwaan had given an advance copy of the report to a public-relations firm that had been retained by the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice and "had lied to the senior partner on the matter about what he had done."

"When asked about that by the senior partner, he lied and said he had no idea how they got an advance copy," Weissmann said. Weissmann also indicated that Skadden "had insisted on being able to write such an independent report."

Van der Zwaan completed a 30-day prison sentence earlier this year.

Craig exited the Skadden firm in April.
__label__politics (CNN) As the second disorientating summer of President Donald Trump's presidency unfolds, it's becoming hard to work out what is real, what is smoke and what is pure fantasy.

But for Trump, that is the point as he faces imminent and medium-term legal and political challenges that could have grave implications for his presidency and give him every incentive to try to make everyone look the other way.

So after a weekend spent spearing special counsel Robert Mueller on Twitter , Trump, helped by his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, on Monday seeded a new cloud of obfuscation and confusion on Russia, budget brinkmanship and Iran. But the President refused to answer questions about the epic meltdown of his relationship with his former lawyer Michael Cohen who now appears bent on bringing him down.

His tetchy mood will likely worsen when Mueller on Tuesday fires up his expensively assembled prosecutorial engine for its first real test in court, when Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort goes on trial on tax and fraud charges in Virginia.

And the approaching midterm elections, the first chance for voters nationwide to cast a verdict on Trump's tumultuous presidency, are also clearly at the top of the President's mind, shaping political and legal strategies that seem to evolve by the hour.

Giuliani unleashed

Giuliani did not just move the goalposts in his defense of Trump from the Mueller probe on Monday -- he ripped up the field and desecrated the stadium.

In a performance clearly calibrated to harden wavering Republicans against Mueller, Giuliani claimed on CNN's "New Day" that he doesn't "even know if that's a crime, colluding about Russians." The President picked up on that line Tuesday morning, tweeting, "Collusion is not a crime, but that doesn't matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats)!"

Collusion is not a crime, but that doesn't matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats)! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2018

This evolution of the Trump defense was notable given that Trump has spent months tweeting "No Collusion!" and it prompted immediate questions about whether the President's legal team was tacitly admitting more liability for the President than it had previously accepted.

While it's true that there is no specific offense of collusion, any proof that the President or his election team knew that there was an attempt by Russia to interfere in the election to help Trump win could plunge them into very hot water.

"What he has said here today of course makes no sense legally, it is a crime to coordinate with foreign nationals and receive a thing of value as a donation, it is a conspiracy to defraud the United States if you engage in that sort of conduct," said Michael Zeldin, a CNN legal analyst who once worked for Mueller at the Justice Department.

A day before Manafort's trial opens in Virginia, the former New York mayor also took steps to distance Trump from his former campaign chairman who he said had responsibility for a "very discrete and important area" in 2016 -- the securing of delegates at the Republican National Convention.

Still, it is already clear that while Trump and the issue of Russian election interference will not be in the dock, the proceedings in Alexandria, Virginia, will loom over the White House as long as the case lasts.

If convicted and with the prospect of spending the rest of his life in jail, there could be new incentives for Manafort to cooperate with Mueller if he has any information about Trump or aides conspiring with Russia's election interference effort.

That reality may help explain Trump's searing attacks on Mueller over the weekend that represent the most personal assault on the special counsel yet by the President . It may also hint at the motivation of Giuliani's muddying mission on Monday that left Trump's legal strategy more confused than ever.

Another stunning summit?

It's been barely a week since Trump tweeted in capital letters warning Iran's President Hassan Rouhani that if he didn't quit threatening the United States his country would "suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before."

Yet on Monday, responding to a question after meeting Italy's Prime Minister, Trump offered to sit down with the Iranian leader -- an encounter that would be the first such meeting since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.

"I would certainly meet with Iran if they wanted to meet," Trump said. "I'm ready to meet whenever they want to."

"No preconditions," he added.

It wasn't actually that surprising that Trump took such an approach. After all, he threw diplomatic convention out of the window by sitting down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June despite the two sides being effectively at war for nearly 70 years.

As the President and his subordinates adopt fearsome rhetoric and escalate the long showdown with the Islamic Republic, they appear to be trying to create the same kind of leverage that appears to have helped get Kim to the table.

Yet the question of how far their approach represents a reality-based strategy must again be asked.

Many analysts believe it is impossible that Iran would agree to sit down with Trump -- for ideological reasons and especially since he pulled out of a nuclear deal agreed by the Obama administration with Tehran. The chances that the President could get a better deal are slim, since the four other permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany that agreed to the original approach are still committed to it, giving Iran little incentive to fold.

It also seems unlikely that Trump's key Middle Eastern allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, would welcome such an approach.

And given the as-yet-unclear results of his recent summits with Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin, an attempt to engineer a summit with Rouhani -- with no preconditions -- would be an act of stunning political bravado.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in an interview with CNBC, later tried to row back Trump's no preconditions offer.

"If the Iranians demonstrate a commitment to make fundamental changes in how they treat their own people, reduce their malign behavior, can agree that it's worthwhile to enter into a nuclear agreement that actually prevents proliferation, then the president said he's prepared to sit down and have the conversation with them," Pompeo said.

His comments reinforced questions about whether the President's remarks were a real statement of US policy or simply an attempt to throw up a smokescreen.

Government shutdown shut down?

As far as Republicans on Capitol Hill were concerned, the idea of a government shutdown was off the table before the midterms following meetings between the President and GOP leaders.

Trump on Monday reinforced a suggestion first made in a tweet by threatening a shutdown to force lawmakers to fund the border wall that was at the center of his 2016 election messaging.

"If we don't get border security after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would have no problem doing a shutdown," Trump said.

The threat could be an attempt by the President to drum up turnout in the midterms.

Yet, as with his statement on Iran and the latest twists of his defense in the Russia matter, it's reasonable to question how real and lasting Monday's threat is likely to be. That's because shuttering Washington before the midterms could rebound against Republicans and drown out attention over the party's top two arguments to conservative voters -- economic growth and the expected confirmation of a second Supreme Court justice.

Still, it was noticeable that Trump did not specifically name a date for a shutdown, leaving open the possibility that he could sign a continuing resolution to fund government through the midterms, then seek a showdown in the lame duck session after the election.

The endgame

Whether the positions Trump and Giuliani rolled out Monday are genuine shifts or are just trial balloons will play out over the next weeks and months.

For now, the fog they laid down on Monday helped the administration get through another day and another news cycle.

But eventually, voters will cast their verdict in the midterms and Mueller will wrap up his probe.

What happens then if those decisions go against Trump will be far more difficult for the President and his team to spin away.
__label__politics (CNN) Former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill made the phrase " all politics is local " famous. The implication being House Democratic or Republicans members could win in districts in which their party's presidential candidate did poorly.

O'Neill's wisdom, however, seems to have been pushed aside in recent years. The presidential voting pattern of a district has become a very strong predictor of how it will vote in House elections. That's why you'll consistently hear folks like myself cite the presidential voting patterns and pretty much only the presidential voting patterns of a district to help explain why it votes the way it does.

The only problem with what analysts are doing is that it's probably wrong, as FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver pointed out last week . Although politics have become more presidential, local voting patterns still give us additional information about a district's partisanship.

Stay up to date on key election dates and other events, such as town halls and debates, as they get added throughout the year. Subscribe on your Google or Apple calendar.

When you look at the race list of competitive races in 2018, you see a lot of districts where Hillary Clinton did well and where Republicans are in trouble. You also see districts such as California's 39th and 49th, where Barack Obama lost and Hillary Clinton easily won.

Some ratings, though, look out of place. President Donald Trump won districts like Kansas 2 (lean Republican in CNN's ratings), Kentucky 6 (lean Republican), North Carolina 9 (toss-up) and West Virginia 3 (toss-up) by 18, 15, 12 and 49 points, respectively. These districts also voted for Mitt Romney by double digits, so these are solid Republican districts on the presidential level.

But now look at how Democrats have been doing in local and state races in the four districts. The Democratic firm TargetSmart provided me with a measurement that is essentially the average local and state Democratic performance in these districts over the past few cycles. In all of them, the Democrats outperformed the 2016 presidential baseline by at least 5 points. In all but North Carolina 9, the average Democrat outpaced Hillary Clinton by at least 10 points. In West Virginia 3, the average local and state Democrat lost this district by less than 2 points even though Trump won it by 49.

In other words, these are all places where local and state election results suggest that given a strong Democratic national environment, Democrats should have a real shot of winning a House seat in 2018 even if the presidential baseline is less optimistic.

Fortunately for Republicans, this goes the other way too. There are some Republican-held districts where members are hanging on when perhaps you would expect otherwise. Race raters have Florida 26 as at worse a toss-up for Republicans and New York 24 as likely Republican. That's not what you would think given that Trump lost both of these districts by greater than he lost nationally. In Florida 26, he was defeated by double digits. Romney lost both districts by double digits.

Again though, look at the local elections. The average Republican in local and state elections lost in Florida 26 by only 2 points. The average Republican in local and statewide elections actually won in New York 24 by 2.

Now, it's obviously no guarantee that Republicans will hold on in these districts. Just like it's not guaranteed that Democrats will win or come close in the districts above. The presidential vote may end up totally trumping local voting patterns.

That's not what happened in 2016, however. I went back and looked at the margin in the House races where one Democrat and one Republican ran (outside of Louisiana, where I have no state voting data). No matter how you measured the presidential voting patterns of a district (just looking at 2016 averaging 2012 and 2016, a weighted average of 2012 and 2016 where 2016 was given more weight), state elections still held some explanatory power.

For example, to best explain the House vote in 2016 using just the 2016 presidential results and the local and state election results over the past few years, you'd weigh the 2016 presidential results at only 1.5 times the local and state results. That is, you want to look at both presidential and local and state results. This, of course, is in the average district. In some districts like Florida 25, the 2016 presidential result was a terrible baseline, and state and local election results were more predictive. In others like Oklahoma 2, the presidential vote was far more explanatory.

It's not always clear why the presidential vote is more important in some districts and less important than others. The quality of the candidates on each side of the aisle certainly plays some role. Candidates with greater ties to the local community (like Conor Lamb earlier this year) might help localize a race, for example.

What is clear is that looking only at the past presidential vote is a mistake for knowing whether or not a district will end up being close. That's probably good news for Democrats. It means a wider playing field for them, especially given that more congressional districts leaned Trump in 2016 than the national vote implied.
__label__politics Beginning jury selection, Judge T.S. Ellis gave the pool of 65 potential jurors an overview of the charges against Manafort, though he reminded the group that the indictment "is not evidence of any guilt whatsoever."

The pool was nearly evenly split between men and women. The group is predominantly white, with fewer than a dozen non-white potential jurors. Most were comfortably middle-aged.

Nine potential jurors indicated that they have connections to the Justice Department, including four who said they were current or former federal employees. Two joked that they were "recovering attorneys." All affirmed that they could handle the case without any bias.

None said they knew Manafort, his lawyers or their law firms.

One younger woman said she knew Justice Department attorneys from her work at a Silicon Valley-based tech company. Another man brought a John Grisham novel into the courtroom.

Trial could last weeks

Opening arguments in the case are likely this week, and the trial is expected to last several weeks.

Manafort was a senior Trump campaign aide and he led the campaign for several months, but the charges are not directly related to campaign activity, as the White House has repeatedly emphasized.

"The judge has very strictly instructed no mention of Paul Manafort's role in the Trump campaign, no mention of Trump, Russia or collusion," senior White House aide Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News Tuesday morning. "This trial obviously centers on matters that have nothing to do with the campaign."

While Trump has repeatedly railed against Manafort and the "witch hunt" on Twitter in recent weeks, he has not tweeted about Manafort specifically in more than a month, when he said Manafort received a "tough sentence" after his bond was revoked over allegations of witness tampering.

Manafort faces a maximum of 305 years in prison if he is convicted on all charges. Prosecutors say Manafort hid millions of dollars in income from lobbying for Ukrainian politicians, failed to pay taxes while spending the money on US real estate and luxury purchases and lied to banks to take out more than $20 million in loans.

Before jury selection got underway, Ellis said that he did not plan to offer decisions on Tuesday about all of the documents that Manafort's team wants to keep out of trial. They hope to prevent jurors from seeing some documents and photos from Manafort's lobbying work in Ukraine.

Instead, the judge gave broad directions to the prosecutors: Try to reduce the number of Ukrainian documents given to the jury, use testimony to add context and don't refer to individual documents in opening statements.

Ellis said he thinks "the government's correct" in using the documents to broadly show how Manafort made his money. Prosecutors say Manafort made $60 million from his work.
__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Women in various parts of South Africa have taken to the streets to protest the increasing levels of gender-based violence in the country.

As South Africa celebrates Women's Month throughout August and National Women's Day on August 9, hundreds of women have decided to use the occasion to raise awareness of violence against women and children under the 'Total Shutdown' banner.

Dubbed an 'intersectional women's march' and organized by WomenProtestSA , the march calls for women to take to the streets under the rallying cry: "My body, not your crime scene."

Organizers also called for men to support by not spending or taking part in any economic activity. They also urged men to donate to 'The Total Shutdown's' cause or by helping women and gender non-conforming people by taking over their work and domestic duties.
__label__world (CNN) Shubnum Khan's face has appeared in McDonald's ads in China, India and South Korea, on a French dating website and in a promotion for a trek in Cambodia.

Friends have spotted her on food advertisements, banking brochures, eye clinics and, more commonly, on makeup websites testifying to the efficacy of products she has never used.

However, Khan is not an international model, nor did she receive any payment for the various global commercial campaigns she appeared in. Khan's is a cautionary tale of the snap decisions we make that can come back to haunt us in often unexpected ways.

Again, the face of positive immigration in Uruguay. (TBH I don't really mind the ads promoting immigration). pic.twitter.com/6JGr1cArhX

As a student, Khan unwittingly signed away the rights to her image in exchange for free prints during a photo shoot.

Those pictures ended up as stock images, used commercially all over the world in campaigns and fake product testimonials.

Khan recounted how she first discovered her image was used in a campaign six years ago, in a now-viral Twitter thread she posted to warn others about taking care to read the small print on contracts.

She said she thought nothing of the agreement with the photographer until a friend alerted her to a Facebook post in 2012, where her face was being used to promote immigration in Canada.

So today I'm going to tell you the story of How I Ended Up with my Face On a McDonald's Advert in China - A Cautionary Tale. Six or so years ago, a friend in Canada posted a pic on my FB wall to say she found an advert of me promoting immigration in a Canadian newspaper. pic.twitter.com/QJ0nWpYNmQ — Shubnum Khan (@ShubnumKhan) July 28, 2018

"That's when I started to do some research and found the images online," she told CNN.

"Naturally I was shocked and ... confused. I studied the pic and agreed that it was me. Now, I didn't mind that I was promoting immigration in Canada, but I couldn't understand why my face was in a paper all the way on that side of the world," Khan said.

Over the years, her face would pop up randomly and in countries from America to China, selling products in ads, billboards, magazines.

She said she has no idea how many countries her ads have appeared in.

One of the adverts showing Shubnum Khan.

"I have heard about adverts in South Africa, (the) USA, London, China, India, Brazil, Uruguay, Canada and Kenya and then I guess you can't really put a country to the adverts online," she said.

Khan said she contacted the photographer, who reminded her of the agreement, although he has said he will stop selling images of her.

He told her he sold the photos to companies specializing in stock images and warned that they may still appear in unusual places.

However, Khan says she has no hard feelings towards the photographer and blamed herself for not reading the small print. "Look, at the end of the day, I signed the document without reading it. I don't agree with the way things were done to us, but I know I have myself to blame in this situation."

"I thought it was to give him permission to use the photos for his portfolio. We didn't read the small print. I know. It was stupid," Khan, who lives in Durban, South Africa said.

Khan, an author who is working on her second novel , said she was amused to see that her nationality became fluid depending on the nature of the advertising campaign.

I can also take on new identities. The most shocking of these are adverts to teach & care for kids - so who is actually with the kids? When I asked the photographer abt this, he says I signed away rights to 'distortion of character including false names'. pic.twitter.com/2MzIZPAfi5 — Shubnum Khan (@ShubnumKhan) July 28, 2018

But the most shocking aspect of it for her were the companies who claimed she had used their products. Khan said it is laughable when people share stories of how her fake testimonials had inspired them.

"I didn't know it was legal to give fake testimonials in any way or form. It really made me realize how much we are lied to as consumers. I'm wondering about the dating website one. Like, who do people actually meet at the end of the day, then?

"For me, that was quite unbelievable. Like I don't know how you get away with that one."

"The most shocking of these are adverts to teach and care for kids -- so who is actually with the kids? When I asked the photographer about this, he says I signed away rights to 'distortion of character including false names,' " she said.

She said she's surprised at how big the story has become since sharing it on Twitter.

"I didn't expect that at all. I knew it was a strange story but I thought people wouldn't get too surprised that things like this happen. I'm glad we can still feel surprised and compassionate about situations like this."

Although she has asked the photographer to take down some of the images, Khan said she is aware of the error of judgment and hopes her story will serve as a warning to others.

"Read what you sign, don't get caught in any hype. When you think, 'oh, I'm not reading this or I don't understand it, but what's the worst that can happen?' "

"I think my example is one of the things that can happen."
__label__world Osan Air Base, South Korea (CNN) Dozens of cases believed to hold the remains of American service members killed during the Korean War are to due to be flown to the United States on Wednesday.

The 55 boxes, which North Korea returned last week, are scheduled to receive a formal send off at South Korea's Osan Air base before being loaded onto a C-17 transport plane on Wednesday afternoon and sent to a military laboratory in Hawaii for identification.

The remains are being repatriated as part of a historic agreement last month between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

During their meeting in Singapore, the first ever between sitting leaders of their respective countries, both Kim and Trump committed to recovering the remains of US service members who died during the Korean War and whose bodies were never found.

The first batch of remains were flown out of North Korea and transported to South Korea on Friday , the anniversary of the armistice that paused hostilities in the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953.

But the process of identifying the remains could take months or years, experts say

A US defense official said only one dog tag was returned with the potential remains, and it's unclear what is inside each box. Given the absence of any additional information, the official said it "will take many months to a few years to identity them based of previous experiences with the identification process."

Joining the vice president are the children of two US service members who never returned from the Korean War. Pence is also the child of a Korean War veteran. His father, Edward J. Pence, Jr., received a Bronze Star for his service.

The United States has tried multiple times over the years to negotiate the return of the remains of those killed in North Korea during the Korean War while fighting on behalf of the United Nations command.

According to the US Department of Defense, 7,697 personnel from the Korean conflict are still unaccounted for, of whom 5,300 are believed to be North of the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea.

The remains of 340 soldiers have been handed over by North Korea since 1990 . The US halted joint efforts with North Korea on recovering remains during the George W. Bush administration as talks with Pyongyang faltered.

Analysts consider the issue to be low-hanging fruit for Pyongyang and Washington negotiators -- something that both sides could easily agree to in order to establish a modicum of trust and good will as they continue to negotiate over North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

Critics say Trump and Kim's agreement fell woefully short on specifics when it comes to Pyongyang's nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles, but Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have preached patience.

Supermarket chain Coles said Wednesday that it was dropping plans to charge for the bags, saying shoppers had struggled to adjust to the change.

But Greenpeace Australia Pacific said the decision to give away plastic bags for free was a "betrayal" and would increase the amount of plastic pollution in the environment.

"This decision makes a complete mockery of Coles' claim to want to reduce plastic waste and is a betrayal of the millions of their customers who want the supermarket to do the right thing in favor of a vocal minority," Zoe Deans, a campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said in a statement Wednesday.

"Coles have caved in far too quickly."

The main opposition Movement for Democratic Change party has won only 41 seats so far. A total of 210 seats were contested.

Zanu-PF is led by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power after Robert Mugabe's 37-year rule ended under the pressure of a military takeover in November 2017.

According to the electoral commission, 70% of registered voters cast their ballot.

The commission has said it would only announce the result of the presidential vote once all 10,985 polling stations verified their results.

__label__world Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN) Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the Danish capital of Copenhagen wearing burqas and other face veils Wednesday to protest a law against facial coverings, saying the legislation oppresses some Muslim women and violates their rights.

Denmark joins several other European nations restricting face coverings. France banned the full face veil in 2011, while Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland have restrictions in place. Other European countries have debated the issue.

Protester Sabina says the law will radically change her life.

The Danish law was passed in May and came into effect Wednesday, meaning people found wearing facial coverings in public could be fined from 1,000 Danish krone ($157), for a first offense, up to 10,000 krone ($1,565) for a fourth violation.

Several women wearing niqabs -- which fully cover the body but leave the eye area open -- said this would make it very difficult for them to leave their homes, whether to take their children to school, grocery shop, or just move around their communities. The burqa covers the entire body and has mesh in the eye area.

A Muslim protester -- Sabina, who gave only her first name and wears a niqab -- said it would have "huge consequences" on her life.

The thieves made off with jewels belonging to former Swedish monarchs Karl IX and Kristina from the Strängnäs Cathedral to the west of the capital, Stockholm, on Tuesday.

Two crowns and a golden orb adorned with a crucifix were taken from the cathedral, which dates back to the 12th century, according to a police report. The items date from the early 17th century.

A witness told Swedish media that he was eating lunch when he saw two people running toward a boat, which they sped away in.

__label__politics (CNN) No one knows better than President Donald Trump what worked for him in 2016, and now he's going back to the well -- trusting no one but himself -- to stave off the threat of a Democratic rout in November that could cripple his presidency.

At a rowdy rally in Tampa, Florida , on Tuesday night that invigorated a crowd that booed Trump's enemies like it was a wrestling bout, the President showed exactly why he's itching to get back on the road for multiple rallies every day ahead of the midterm elections.

Trump will not be one of those presidents who only grudgingly tears himself away from the weighty affairs of state to campaign for party lawmakers. And if he suffers the traditional first-term bloody nose from midterm voters, it won't be because he didn't campaign hard enough.

"It's a lot easier to act presidential than to do what I do. Anybody can act presidential!" Trump declared, before tottering across the stage in a parody of a presidential walk, mocking the Oval Office conventions he has shredded since his inauguration, and admitting he likes to be a "little wild, have a little fun" at rallies.

It was an anarchical moment that highlighted the comedy that is an underestimated ingredient of Trump's demagogic technique. It helps bind him to supporters who feel bitter about Washington institutions they believe have cast them cruelly aside.

But it was also a flash of self-awareness by an idiosyncratic politician who intimately understands his own method as one of the great political entertainers, whose skill at fanning resentments is fundamental to his appeal for a large chunk of voters.

Going out on the road, where Trump shatters taboos and dodges accountability for his wild misrepresentations, offers him more than the chance to draw energy from those who love him.

The Tampa rally was a reminder that Trump -- the man, the President and his entire political project -- can be sustained only with the anger, the adulation and the chance to tear at the nation's most irritated political divides that he can find only in a campaign context.

But Trump's rallies bathe loyalists in an alternative reality where things are going great with North Korea -- despite reports to the contrary -- in which he's running the most prolific presidency in history and fact-based arguments to the contrary are just "fake news."

Tuesday's event also featured ugly scenes of Trump supporters chanting abuse at journalists in town to cover the President -- which appears to be a direct result of his rhetoric that the media is "the enemy of the people."

The outsider is back

Trump, nearly two years on from his shock election win, presented himself to his closest supporters Tuesday as exactly the same outsider voice of the forgotten man and scourge of political correctness who romped to victory in 2016. He is playing to tangible evidence that his poor press and the disgust of establishment politicians are still the driving forces of his appeal among his base.

He once again blasted cancer-stricken Republican Sen. John McCain for his thumbs down vote helping to stall GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and he renewed his canard that he had made it safe for Americans to say "Merry Christmas" again.

The question for Trump fewer than 100 days from the elections, and as the pace is already heating up for his own re-election race, is whether the magic can work a second and then a third time outside the confined world of his political base -- especially this year, when he is not on the ballot.

Or will the President find it impossible to transfer his appeal to candidates like Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis, who is running a campaign in Trump's image in Florida's gubernatorial primary and who basked in the President's endorsement on Tuesday?

Then there is the issue of whether Trump's off-the-cuff style -- seen this week in his threats to shut down the government if he doesn't get funding for his border wall -- will emerge as a distraction from the GOP message, and a negative for GOP candidates in crucial swing districts.

After all, Trump's presidency has produced a more credible narrative than GOP bosses may have hoped for earlier this year. They can tout strong economic growth, a President who is dominating the globe and two Supreme Court nominations that delight social conservatives -- though of course that narrative of achievement will be robustly challenged by Trump's opponents.

Concern about the midterms

CNN's Dana Bash reported on Tuesday that the President is telling aides he wants to considerably increase the number of rallies he headlines. He is arguing he must take his fate into his own hands, a fact that might explain his recent manic tweeting.

The sources familiar with Trump's thinking also told Bash he is genuinely concerned about the outcome of November's elections, in which Democrats have perhaps a better than 50-50 chance of taking the House -- and seriously curtailing his political power in Washington.

As in previous rallies, the President let his unease show on Tuesday, warning voters they need to be just as engaged as they were two years ago.

"To keep it going, we need to elect more Republicans. We need more votes," Trump said in Tampa.

The President also previewed the hard-core message on immigration that he will use to whip up the fervor of his base and turn his remarkable hold on the party he took over into votes at the polls in November.

"These are people that don't care about stopping crime. These are people who don't care about people pouring into our country when they shouldn't be here," Trump said, in a searing attack on Democratic candidates.

Trump boasted about second-quarter economic growth of 4.1%, said his tariff war was reviving American steel making, warned that America would no longer be a "puppet" and be ripped off by its allies, vowed to stand up for the National Anthem and beamed as the crowd chanted its anti-Hillary Clinton anthem, "Lock her up! Lock her up!"

Much of Trump's message might be radioactive in states where Republican House members are running in districts that went to Clinton in 2016 and that could decide the balance of power in Washington beginning in January 2019.

But everyone in the White House, and in the GOP hierarchy, has long since stopped trying to rein in the President. And Trump is making clear that after nearly two years of base-pleasing policies, he is not going to change what got him where he is.

As he put it Tuesday: "I am not like other politicians. You have seen what happens. I have kept my promises."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller has offered to reduce the number of obstruction-related questions President Donald Trump would be asked by investigators, sources familiar with the negotiations tell CNN. However, Mueller wants obstruction to be addressed in person, not just in written answers.

The President's lawyers had previously offered the special counsel written answers to obstruction questions and limiting the interview to matters before his presidential inauguration, which are largely confined to collusion.

Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told reporters Wednesday that the President's legal team has received a response from Mueller's team regarding their counter-proposal for a potential interview with the President.

"We're in the process of responding to their proposal," Giuliani said after an event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, indicating that Mueller's team had responded Tuesday.

He added that Trump has "always been interested in testifying. It's us, meaning the team of lawyers, including me, that have the most reservations about that."

Obama endorsed 81 people for this first wave and is expected to endorse more ahead of the midterm elections. His office said Wednesday that the former president is also expected to campaign in several states for 2018 candidates.

His endorsement list includes several people in high-profile races, including Gavin Newsom for governor of California, Stacey Abrams for governor of Georgia and Jacky Rosen for US Senate in Nevada.

Former Obama administration officials and campaign alumni were among those who snagged Obama's backing. They include Colin Allred, Andrew Kim, Tom Malinowski, Lauren Underwood, Richard Cordray and Jill Schiller.

The trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort will have a courtroom packed with media and spectators. Few judges might relish that attention. Yet Ellis, who has overseen cases involving congressional corruption and the "American Taliban," is one of the few.

Though no electronics are allowed in his courthouse, Ellis has had a knack for conjuring shock, awe and tweetable moments in the courtroom so far with Manafort.

"You don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud," Ellis told the special counsel in May. Trump is "what you're really interested in."

In his 30 years on the bench in the Eastern District of Virginia, Ellis has developed a reputation for being long-winded and sharp-minded. He takes special delight in toying with attorneys. His sense of humor can turn to sternness in a second. And his courtroom antics don't always tip his hand to his legal thinking. For instance, after scolding Robert Mueller's office, he sided with the special counsel anyway.

"Those of us who've been around for a long time take some of those observations with a grain of salt," William Cummings, a criminal defense attorney who's practiced in Ellis' district for 54 years, said about an early Manafort hearing where Ellis appeared to sympathize with the defense arguments. "I don't think you can read that as more than testing the government and expressing concerns that are publicly being expressed to see what kind of reaction he gets."

In a criminal trial like Manafort's, the 12-person jury commands the ultimate decision on the former Trump campaign chairman's guilt.

But Ellis' presence will contribute greatly to the tone and pace of the trial. He'll have ample opportunity to keep the lawyers in check and will decide upon legal questions they raise. He also took the lead in questioning potential jurors Tuesday about their impartiality before they were chosen.

If the jury reaches a guilty verdict, Ellis would be the sole decider of Manafort's sentence, and have virtual free range to set it how he chooses. Manafort, 69, faces allegations he committed bank fraud and hid money from federal authorities as he spent millions on luxury goods. He faces a sentence of more than 300 years in prison if convicted on all 18 counts. He has denied all charges against him.

In the courtroom, Ellis perches several steps above prosecutors and defendants, with his clerks providing a buffer between them in the tranquil dark cherry courtroom. When an FBI agent testified in a pretrial hearing for Manafort last month, Ellis paced around his leather chair, listening and occasionally cutting in to guide the attorneys in their questioning.

"Next question," he interjected several times. Several times he asked the witness his own questions. He hardly looked up. At another point, he cut off an attorney's question. "You're leading," Ellis said. He then suggested to the prosecutor a different phrasing.

"He is very interactive with the parties, never reluctant to probe vigorously with respect to issues where he has questions," said Timothy Belevetz of the law firm Holland & Knight.

Scolded special counsel's office

Ellis expects lawyers to come prepared -- because he will make sure he is. Preparedness is among one of the many traits he learned years ago in his legal practice, he's quick to remind the attorneys before him. He's also prone to telling personal stories and alluding to unrelated cases when he recognizes people in the courtroom from his past work.

Early in Manafort's proceedings, Ellis criticized the special counsel's office lawyers for thinking they could try Manafort's case without ever having practiced law in his district. (The top trial lawyers prosecuting Manafort have the most experience in Brooklyn's federal court.) At the next hearing, the special counsel's team had brought aboard Uzo Asonye, an assistant US attorney experienced with Ellis in the Alexandria federal court.

"Mr. Asonye has some experience here. Is that right, Mr. Asonye?" Ellis said at a start of a May hearing for Manafort's case. "So he can tell you some interesting things."

The sidebars are only part of Ellis' idiosyncrasies. He also loves the intellectual exercise of arguing legal nuance.

"Most every prosecutor would tell a story about being forced to brief issues ad nauseum including during trial," said Scott Fredericksen, a former section chief in the Eastern District of Virginia who now handles criminal white-collar cases at the law firm Foley & Lardner.

No stranger to high-profile cases, in 2009 Ellis presided over the case of former US Rep. William Jefferson of Louisiana, a Democrat who was convicted of corruption charges. In 2017, Ellis vacated some of the charges after the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and limited the types of conduct that can support charges of corruption.

Coincidentally, Amy Berman Jackson argued for Jefferson at the trial with Ellis. She is now a federal judge in DC who is presiding over Manafort's related case and has given Manafort's team a consistently tough response.

Though they initially appeared to feel differently about Manafort, Berman Jackson and Ellis have agreed so far on nearly every legal request Manafort has made to them. They've both denied Manafort's attempts to throw out evidence prosecutors collected from Manafort's apartment and storage unit, and both have defended Mueller's legal authority in their opinions.

Some court-watchers initially suspected Ellis might split with Berman Jackson and bat down Mueller's case after Manafort argued the special counsel was out of bounds with allegations largely unrelated to the presidential election.

"You don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud," Ellis said in court earlier this year.

The comments jolted Washington, and Trump himself made Ellis a cause célèbre. The President that day read news stories about Ellis' comments at an NRA event, using them to pile on to his "witch hunt" refrain.

Almost two months later, Ellis ruled on the question the opposite of the way Trump wished. Ellis warned the special counsel to stay away from politics, yet defended Mueller's authority in the Manafort case and under the US Constitution.

CIA and 'American Taliban'

Several lawyers said Ellis appears to lean toward conservativism, though the Reagan appointee's politics aren't widely known. In a few past high-profile cases involving national security, he was tough toward defendants.

In 2006, Ellis ruled in favor of the George W. Bush administration, dismissing a case brought by Khaled El-Masri, a German citizen of Lebanese descent who claimed he had been abused by the CIA's "black renditions" teams in 2003.

Ellis said that while the dismissal "deprives" El-Masri of an "American judicial forum" to vindicate his claims, his private interests "must give way to the national interest in preserving state secrets."

In 2002, Ellis heard the case of John Walker Lindh, who earned the moniker of "American Taliban" as he faced trial after the September 11, 2001, attacks. Though the prosecutors had asked Ellis to approve a plea deal that would limit Lindh's jail time, they had some concern he might disagree with the deal. Ellis sentenced the 21-year-old from California to the maximum 20 years in prison under Lindh's plea.

"Life is making choices and living with the consequences," Ellis told Lindh in open court. "You made a bad choice to join the Taliban."

Ellis' court regularly hears high-profile cases, especially criminal, because several government agencies are located in Virginia.

Born in 1940 in Bogotá, Colombia, Ellis graduated from Princeton with an engineering degree. He served as an aviator in the US Navy, then studied law at Harvard Law School and Oxford University. When assessing the functions of American special prosecutors like Mueller in court, Ellis has grown wistful about his younger days in Britain and compared the US approach to British investigative commissions.

In Manafort's case, Elllis is likely to take a more workmanlike approach. He told federal prosecutors recently they needed to cut a week off their planned presentation.

"Do you have any idea how many bank frauds and income tax false statements (trials) I've heard?" he asked. "None of them last three weeks. None."
__label__politics (CNN) The Trump administration is considering increasing the rate of proposed tariffs to 25% on an additional $200 billion worth of goods from China.

The White House had previously asked the Office of the United States Trade Representative about the possibility of imposing a 10% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. But under a new plan the tariffs would more than double in size.

Talks between the world's two largest economies are at an impasse in the trade spat, with both sides continuing to threaten new tariffs.

The United States has already slapped 25% tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion to punish Beijing for what it says are its unfair trade practices, such as forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology. China immediately responded with equal measures.

In the latest step, President Donald Trump has directed US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider increasing the proposed tariff level on fruit and vegetables, handbags, refrigerators, and more. The trade office has extended its previous deadline of Aug. 30 to allow the public more time to comment on the new plan. Those comments are now due on Sept. 5.

__label__world (CNN) It's right there in the Australian national anthem -- "Our land abounds in nature's gifts, of beauty rich and rare."

But despite their international reputation as an outdoor-loving, environmentally conscious population, how much do Australians actually care about their impact on the environment, at home or abroad?

The country made headlines across the world on Wednesday after a major supermarket chain decided to give away plastic bags indefinitely for free, rather than charge a small fee, after a customer backlash.

It didn't last -- following widespread environmentalist outrage, Coles managing director John Durkan announced in an email to staff on Thursday morning customers would again have to pay 15 Australian cents (11 cents) for plastic bags from August 29.

A sign, seen in a Coles supermarket in Sydney, advises its customers of its plastic bag-free policy on July 2.

Coles' plastic bag flip-flop was just the latest example of Australians reacting badly to an environmentally positive policy which would inconvenience them at a personal level.

Previous attempts by the federal government to legislate action against climate change and provide greater support of renewable energy have been met with vicious opposition.

"I think most Australians don't really privilege the environment above their own convenience," Jamie Fitzpatrick, distinguished professor of geography and environmental studies at University of Tasmania, told CNN.

"They might be sympathetic to the environment and think it's a good thing to have koalas and not having climate change and have clean water and stuff like that, but when it comes to making a decision between what you do and what's convenient and easy, it's just further down the wish list."

Charred trees and bushes stand amid the aftermath of a destructive bushfire near One Tree Hill in the Adelaide Hills on January 5, 2015.

Physical attacks over plastic bags

Many states and territories, including the Australian Capital Territory, had charged for plastic bags for years with very little complaint.

But when the decision to charge for plastic bags was rolled out more widely across the country, the reaction, particularly in conservative media, was livid.

Justifying the initial decision to end charges indefinitely on Wednesday, Coles had said customers needed "more time to make the transition," but reports from union officials published in local media talked about checkout workers being attacked over the decision to charge for plastic bags.

"(One customer) came up behind (a checkout worker) and put his hands around her throat," the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association Western Australian assistant secretary Ben Harris told Australia's Nine News.

The union even felt it necessary to run a national campaign discouraging abusive behavior to checkout workers over the ban, titled "Don't Bag Retail Staff."

"Don't abuse retail staff, just buy a reusable bag or bring your own," the campaign's video said.

Before Thursday's reversal by Coles was announced, conservative columnist and TV host Andrew Bolt celebrated the decision on his blog, where he encouraged customers to boycott Coles main competitor, Woolworths, to protest against "mindless green gestures."

Bolt had previously written multiple columns in Australia's local papers calling for the plastic bag charge to be overturned, even implying reusable bags were bad for people's health.

"It's bad enough that Woolworths wants to stuff its customers around with its pointless new plastic bags ban, but must they die for the planet as well?" Bolt wrote on June 25.

Climate change chaos

It isn't just a deep-seated hatred of paying for plastic bags which has revealed Australians reluctance to pay for environmentally positive policies.

When the center-left government under Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced it would be legislating a carbon price to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions in 2011, a group of protestors carried a coffin into parliament with "democracy" written on it.

JUST WATCHED Study shows melting of Antarctica is speeding up Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Study shows melting of Antarctica is speeding up 03:58

In 2012, Gillard's carbon price was met with furious opposition following its passage, including protests with banners with slogan like "ditch the witch," and it was struck down by the conservative Liberal Party after a change of government in 2013.

Repeated polling has shown that at least 64% of Australians believe climate change is occurring and human beings are responsible, according to a September 2017 poll by Essential.

But when it comes to taking action, particularly action which comes at a cost or raising power prices, Australians have been less enthusiastic.

A Newspoll survey published in The Australian newspaper in October 2017 found almost half of those polled would support dropping out of the Paris Climate Change agreement if it would lower power prices.

Meanwhile Australia's greenhouse gas emission levels continue to rise year after year, according to Australia's Climate Council.

"Climate action is a car wreck in Australia at the moment," Fitzpatrick said.

'Adolescent country'

Speaking to CNN, writer and commentator Jane Caro said the big problem with Australians was that they were complacent about their country's natural beauty.

"We don't quite realize how under threat it is ... We look out our window and see beautiful blue skies and oceans and we drive down the road to a national park," she said.

"We're an adolescent country, we find it hard to think widely."

But they might not be able to pretend much longer. Australia is in the grip of a severe drought, with huge swathes of the country's most populous states without sufficient water.

Meanwhile the ever-present threat of bushfires grows more immediate and severe with every passing year.

"People are making comments to me, because we've had such mild winters and we're looking at what's going on in Europe and forest fires in the Arctic Circle, and what they're thinking is, what is this summer going to be like?" Caro said.
__label__world (CNN) New Zealand's leader says she's ready to get back to the day-to-day business of running the country as her maternity leave comes to an end.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern returned to the office Thursday after a six-week absence, during which Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters acted as caretaker.

In an interview with the country's TVNZ network, she said that she was "absolutely" ready to come back to work.

"I feel like I've been gifted... this time to be with Neve, but under the unique circumstances I'm very keen to get back to work," she said, referring to her baby, Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford

Calling the maternity leave "the fastest six weeks of my life," the young leader said that it would be challenging to balance being a new parent with running the nation of almost 5 million people.

__label__politics (CNN) Several factors that pollsters look at are predicting a "blue wave' in the fall elections, and some observers are calling 2018 the "year of the woman" given the number of female candidates running across the country. And it seems female voters are getting ready to strengthen the Democratic Party.

In CNN's June poll , half of voters said they'd vote for a Democratic candidate in the upcoming midterm elections, with 42% saying they'd vote for a Republican. This question is colloquially referred to as the generic ballot, and it's a useful measure of how the two parties will perform in an election.

There are other predictors that find a "blue wave" is coming as well.

First off, more people (especially women) are planning on voting for the Democratic candidate this year. This is somewhat expected since the opposing party holds the presidency and majorities in both chambers of Congress.

The amount of people saying they'll vote for the Democratic candidate has increased by 5 percentage points in total, by 1 percentage point among men and by 8 percentage points among women compared with near this time before the midterm elections in 2014. The men's vote for the Republican candidate also has increased, but only by 2 percentage points, while female support for the GOP has dropped by 10 percentage points.

__label__politics (CNN) With many children have yet to be unified with their parents, Ivanka Trump broke her silence on family separations at the US-Mexico border, saying Thursday that the news "was a low point" during her time in the White House.

"That was a low point for me as well," she said Thursday, speaking at an Axios Newsmakers conversation on workforce development at the Newseum. "I felt very strongly about that and I am very vehemently against family separation and the separation of parents and children so I would agree with that sentiment. Immigration is incredibly complex as a topic. Illegal immigration is incredibly complicated."

Earlier this year, the Trump administration's immigration "zero-tolerance" policy resulted in the separation of thousands of children from their families. In June, President Donald Trump reversed course, signing an executive order to keep parents and kids together, but as of last week's deadline, 1 in 3 children still remained away from their parents

That number has fallen somewhat, though it's hard to know exactly how much because the government is no longer counting children it has released to other appropriate adults, like family members. At a congressional hearing Tuesday, Commander Jonathan White of the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps said 559 kids of the original 2,551 from separated families remain in custody . That number includes mainly children whose parents were deported, as well as children whose parents were released into the interior and children who were deemed ineligible for family reunification due to other factors, he said.

Ivanka Trump continued Thursday, "I am the daughter of an immigrant, my mother grew up in communist Czech Republic, but we are a country of laws. She came to this country legally and we have to be very careful about incentivizing behavior that puts children at risk of being trafficked, at risk of entering this country with coyotes or making an incredibly dangerous journey alone. These are not easy issues, these are incredibly difficult issues and like the rest of the country, I experienced them actually in a very emotional way."

Ivanka Trump remained silent as the images, audio and stories from the border captured the nation's attention in June, the White House issuing a statement on her behalf. She met with her father to discuss the images of families being separated before he signed his executive order, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told CNN at the time

"She offered the President her support and she said she would talk to any member of Congress to help find a legislative solution to the issue," Gidley said.

After their meeting, the senior adviser called House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, both Republican lawmakers with whom she developed a close relationship during her push on the child tax credit.

Her private conversation with her father was first revealed by the President during a closed-door meeting with House Republicans.

"He mentioned Ivanka talked to him about that," New York's Republican Rep. Chris Collins told reporters after the meeting.

Collins continued: "His daughter had seen the images and said for a lot of reasons we should be dealing with this."
__label__politics Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) The third day of Paul Manafort's trial is poised to feature more talk of the former Trump campaign chairman's lavish lifestyle -- as well as more fighting between prosecutors and the judge over showing jurors pictures of Manafort's luxury purchases.

Special counsel Robert Mueller's team is also planning to dive into the nuts and bolts of its case against Manafort, who is charged with 18 counts of tax and banking violations, as they are preparing to call Manafort's bookkeepers and accounts to the witness stand on Thursday.

Manafort has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and the trial is clearly on the mind of his former boss, President Donald Trump, who tweeted several times about the case on Wednesday. While Manafort's case isn't about the 2016 campaign, he's the first defendant Mueller's team has taken to trial, and the outcome could affect public opinion of the special counsel investigation the President has called a "witch hunt."

Mueller's team is quickly moving through its list of witnesses, and nine testified in the first two days of the trial. The prosecution has more "vendors" on tap for Wednesday, in addition to bookkeepers, accountants and a "series of tax preparers."

Gates likely will testify. What about Manafort?

__label__world Rome (CNN) Pope Francis has declared that the death penalty is never admissible and that the Catholic Church will work towards its abolition around the world, the Vatican formally announced Thursday.

The change, which has been added to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, makes official a position that the Pope has articulated since he became pontiff.

The church now teaches that "the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person" and states that it will "work with determination towards its abolition worldwide," the Vatican said.

The declaration by Pope Francis, who is spiritual leader to the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, may have particular resonance in the United States, where capital punishment remains legal in 31 states and as a federal punishment.

The Catholic Church's teaching on the death penalty has slowly evolved since the time of Pope John Paul II, who served from 1978 to 2005.

In his Christmas message in 1998, John Paul wished "the world the consensus concerning the need for urgent and adequate measures ... to end the death penalty."

His successor, Benedict XVI, in a document published in November 2011, called on society's leaders "to make every effort to eliminate the death penalty."

Francis wrote in a March 2015 letter to the president of the International Commission Against the Death Penalty that "today capital punishment is unacceptable, however serious the condemned's crime may have been."

He added that the death penalty "entails cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment" and said it was to be rejected "due to the defective selectivity of the criminal justice system and in the face of the possibility of judicial error."

'Key point here is really human dignity'

The change announced Thursday was "important" but should not come as a surprise, Vatican spokesman Greg Burke told CNN.

"It was expected for a long time, starting with John Paul II," he said. "He had a document, 'The Gospel of Life,' in which he said it is essentially the conditions (that) were once considered OK for allowing the death penalty have basically disappeared.

"The key point here is really human dignity," Burke said. "The Pope is saying that no matter how grievous the crime, someone never loses his or her human dignity.

"One of the rationales for the death penalty in Catholic teachings historically was to protect society. Obviously, the state still has that obligation," he said. "That is not being taken away here, but they can do that in other ways."

Francis in a 2015 speech to the US Congress said that human life must be defended "at every stage of its development."

"This conviction has led me, from the beginning of my ministry, to advocate at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty," Francis told top US elected lawmakers.

"I am convinced that this way is the best, since every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes."

Francis also noted that the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, a powerful lobbying force, had already advocated for the abolition of the death penalty.

"Not only do I support them, but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation," Francis said.

53% of US Catholics back death penalty

Rights group Amnesty International recorded at least 993 executions in 23 countries in 2017, down 4% from 2016 and 39% from 2015.

Most executions took place in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Pakistan, in that order, it said in a report published in April.

For the ninth year running, the United States was the only country to carry out executions in the Americas region, Amnesty International said. There were 23 executions in the United States in 2017, while 41 death sentences were handed down.

"The number of US states carrying out executions increased from five in 2016 to eight, with Arkansas, Ohio and Virginia resuming executions after a hiatus," the report said.

"Four states -- Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri and Nebraska -- as well as US federal courts, imposed death sentences in 2017, after a hiatus, bringing the number of US states imposing death sentences to 15."

54% favor the death penalty for people convicted of murder, while 39% are opposed, according to a Among Americans,54% favor the death penalty for people convicted of murder, while 39% are opposed, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in April and May.

That represents a slight increase since 2016, when public support for the death penalty reached a four-decade low, Pew said in a June news release.

Its survey found that 53% of Catholics favor capital punishment, while 42% oppose it. Support for the death penalty is highest among white evangelical Protestants, Pew said.
__label__politics New York (CNN) Suspected Russian-run Facebook pages that were taken offline this week were used to organize protests across the country and convinced unwitting Americans to work with them -- in one instance, CNN has learned, even sending an activist a megaphone and a bouquet of roses.

Facebook's culling of the accounts came ahead of an event planned for Washington, DC, next week that one of the pages was promoting. Facebook said the network of pages had promoted a few dozen events since May 2017.

A Facebook event promoting a demonstration advocating universal health care that took place in New York City on July 17, 2017, was managed and promoted by 13 different Facebook pages. While most of the pages were seemingly legitimate activist groups, among them was a page called "Resisters," one of the pages Facebook removed on Tuesday.

What went on behind the scenes of the New York rally has all the hallmarks of tactics used by Kremlin-linked groups.

A week before the event, Mariana Pineda, a health care activist living in Long Island, received a message from a woman named "Mary Smith" asking to help coordinate the event.

In an interview with CNN, Pineda said she understood Smith to be associated with the "Resisters" group. Smith, whose profile photo showed a young black woman, said she was given Pineda's name by another activist, and she asked Pineda if she could step in and help run the event.

Pineda, who is affiliated with a number of health care advocacy groups and campaigned for Bernie Sanders in 2016, agreed, saying it's not unusual for activists who have never met to communicate online to coordinate events. She told CNN that health care advocacy is a personal issue because she lost her insurance while she was pregnant and had a waiting period before being covered again by Medicaid.

Smith asked Pineda to look into getting permits for the rally, and when Pineda mentioned they would need a sound system for speakers at the event, Smith offered to send her a megaphone in the mail.

A few days later, the event went ahead and a modest gathering of demonstrators listened as speakers talked about the need for Medicare for all, through the white megaphone Pineda had received in the mail from her new acquaintance Mary Smith.

A few days after the rally, two dozen roses were delivered to Pineda's Long Island home, apparently a thank-you for her help in coordinating the event.

"First a megaphone, now two dozen red roses. ... You really know the way to a (socialist) girl's heart, lol," Pineda posted on Facebook at the time.

The disappearance of Mary Smith

Pineda had not heard from, or thought about, "Mary Smith" in a while.

After CNN contacted Pineda on Tuesday, she said she found Smith's account was no longer on the platform. CNN understands that Smith's profile was among the 30 accounts and profiles Facebook removed on Tuesday, which Facebook suspects may be tied to a Russian troll group.

When asked if she was concerned she may have unwittingly been communicating with suspected Russian trolls, Pineda told CNN, "I haven't been fooled by Russians, one particular group may or may not be tied to Russians," and pointed out that many real Americans and legitimate activist groups were also involved in the demonstration and that Facebook hadn't conclusively proved the accounts were Russian.

"Everything can be exploited at any time by anyone. You could be a part of an organization and you could be infiltrated by police officers that are looking to gather intelligence if they think that you're going to be doing a disruptive event," she said.

She said outlets including CNN spend too much time on the topic of Russian interference, "I think that this country is spending entirely too much time dwelling on Russia when we have so many more issues to talk about like the water in flint Michigan and young African men who are being killed by the police and by others so I think that we need to stop talking about Russia and start talking about health care."

Impact

In February, special counsel Robert Mueller's office indicted a Russian troll group, the Internet Research Agency, on charges related to an alleged conspiracy to defraud the United States.

One of the group's clear goals was to co-opt unwitting Americans to stage events across the United States. On one occasion in May 2016, the group even organized two opposing demonstrations to take place at the same time in Houston.

Effectively exploiting the nature of the often faceless coordination of real protests and demonstrations through social media, the group would set up Facebook events, and then, in an effort to make the events appear legitimate, would reach out, often through Facebook, to real American activist groups asking them to promote or co-host the events. Occasionally, it would go a step further and provide materials or financial assistance to real, unwitting activists to help run the event.

New York, Texas, CNN has documented instances similar to this in Florida Minnesota and elsewhere.

Facebook said Tuesday that it "found evidence of some connections between these accounts" and accounts that had been run by the Internet Research Agency but that it couldn't conclusively determine the accounts were tied to the group. In closed briefings with lawmakers the company said it suspected Russians were behind the accounts , a congressional source briefed on the matter told CNN.

Pineda is not deterred.

"If you're on social media, you've already exposed yourself," she said, before encouraging CNN to come back another time and interview her about issues she spends much of her time campaigning on, rather than Russian trolls. "I'm having my health care justice working group meeting on August 4th at Panera Bread so we welcome Russians, we welcome communists, we welcome socialists because this Russia hysteria has to stop."

__label__politics (CNN) Two big races in Tennessee take place on Thursday, with the hotly contested Republican governor's primary coming to a close and the race to replace GOP Sen. Bob Corker expected to take shape.

Democrat Phil Bredesen and Republican Marsha Blackburn, both running for US Senate, are widely expected to win the nomination from their respective parties.

The race is slated to be one of the most hotly contested of the 2018 midterms, pitting a moderate Democrat with a record of winning in Tennessee against a firebrand conservative looking to draft off President Donald Trump's support. Republicans had never expected they would be competing for a Senate seat in ruby-red Tennessee, but Bredesen's cross-party appeal and Trump's sagging popularity have made the race competitive.

If Blackburn wins in the fall, she would be the first woman from Tennessee to serve in the US Senate.

__label__world David Reinert holds a Q sign as he waits to enter a Trump rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on Thursday, August 2. Similar signs also were seen during Trump's speech in Tampa this week. It's an apparent reference to QAnon, a group that originated on the 4chan messaging board around an anonymous user, "Q," who claims to be a member of the US military intelligence. The group's theory, among other things, alleges that several A-list figures in the entertainment industry and the government are involved in child sex crimes and a "deep state" effort to annihilate Trump.
__label__politics (CNN) Democrats have hit an unexpected speed bump in their drive to regain control of Congress: unsettling signs that the party may not generate as much turnout or support among Latino voters this fall as it expected.

Despite a procession of provocations from President Donald Trump -- from ending deportation protections for so-called "Dreamers," young immigrants brought to the country illegally by their parents, to his now-terminated policy that resulted in children being separated from their undocumented parents at the border -- a growing number of Democratic strategists are privately concerned that their candidates are not consolidating Latino support as much as they anticipated in several key races.

While cautioning that there is still time to reverse the trend, they point to signs of wavering Hispanic support and engagement in House districts in Texas, Nevada, Florida and California, and in Senate races in Texas, Nevada, Florida and Arizona.

"I still think it's a little too soon to push the panic button, but having said that, we are not seeing the types of numbers with Hispanic voters that we should be seeing with the most hostile person to ever hold public office against Hispanics as the President," said Fernand Amandi, principal at Bendixen & Amandi International, a Democratic polling firm that specializes in studying Latino voters. "And that in and of itself is a concern. I'm flabbergasted."

Private Democratic polling has found surprisingly lackluster results among Hispanics in such House races as the San Antonio-area House seat, where Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones is facing Republican Rep. Will Hurd; the exurban Los Angeles seat that Republican Rep. Steve Knight is defending against Democrat Katie Hill; and the battle in Orange County, California, for the open seat being vacated by Republican Rep. Darrell Issa.

Not all Democratic strategists see cause for alarm. Latino Decisions, another Democratic polling firm that specializes in Latino voters, and Stanley B. Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster, have each recently released separate surveys for Democratic organizations that find the party maintaining a healthy lead over Republicans when Hispanics are asked which party they intend to support in House elections.

Yet virtually everyone on both sides of this Democratic debate agrees on one point: Despite all his confrontational rhetoric and policies, Trump alone appears unlikely to reverse the usual falloff in Hispanic turnout during midterm elections, and he may not even widen the typical Democratic advantage among them in their vote preferences.

Neither public polls nor private research suggests an organic surge to the polls among Hispanic voters outraged by Trump is developing the way it appears to be coalescing among college-educated white women and African-American women. And that means Democrats face their typical challenge of energizing a community whose voter participation has remained stubbornly low.

"I think that the turnout is not guaranteed and all of the candidates and the interest groups have a lot of work to do," said Matt Barreto, co-founder and managing partner of Latino Decisions. "They don't want the anger to sit there and fester and turn into so much frustration that people don't feel that there is anything they can do."

From Florida to California

The alarms among Democrats over Hispanic intentions have been triggered partly by a series of recent public polls showing their candidates underperforming with those voters in several key races.

The findings start in Florida, where a recent Mason-Dixon survey showed Hispanics providing Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson only a narrow 44 percent to 39 percent lead over Republican Rick Scott. Republicans typically run better among Hispanics in Florida than elsewhere, because the state's large Cuban population has historically tilted right.

But Democrats have been improving because of their strength among Florida's growing Puerto Rican community, which has swelled again in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Exit polls found that Hillary Clinton beat Trump among the state's Hispanic voters by 27 percentage points in 2016. Yet Scott's aggressive outreach to the community has raised fears among Democrats that Nelson won't nearly match that margin with Latinos.

Several Texas polls have also shown surprisingly modest advantages for Democrat Beto O'Rourke over Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The most recent Quinnipiac Poll gave O'Rourke just a 12-percentage-point lead over Cruz among Latinos. The nonpartisan Texas Lyceum Poll gave O'Rourke a comparable 15-point lead among all registered Latinos and a wider, but still subpar, 19-point lead among the Latinos the survey deemed likely to vote.

Joshua Blank, manager of polling and research at the University of Texas at Austin's Texas Politics Project, says that while most Texas Latinos support Democrats, there's no evidence yet that Trump's agenda is prompting much defection among the significant minority of them who consistently back Republicans.

"The reality is there are about one-third of Texas Hispanics who hold relatively restrictionist attitudes on immigration, support Republican positions, support Republican candidates ... and they were doing that while (Republican) politicians in this state were spending $800 million on border security and trying to pass sanctuary city laws with 'show me your papers' provisions," Blank said. "It's not that Trump comes along and Texas Hispanics are saying: 'What's going on here?' It's what has been going on here, and they have already arrived at those opinions."

In a third key Senate race, a public poll in Arizona , from OH Predictive Insights and the local ABC channel, found Democratic Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema underperforming among Latinos against her most likely Republican opponent, Rep. Martha McSally. The survey actually found McSally leading with those voters, though few in either party consider that a possibility on Election Day, and OH Predictive Insights, which conducted the poll, cautions that the margin of error among Latino voters is high because the sample is small. Even so, some Democrats privately worry that Sinema has focused too much on convincing center-right white voters that she is concerned about border security and not enough on persuading Latinos she will defend their interests.

Also raising some eyebrows: The most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll put Trump's approval among Latinos at 39 percent, well above his 28 percent share of the vote among them in 2016, according to exit polls.

Some Latino activists have long viewed public polls of their community -- including exit polls -- as unreliable and contended they tend to underrepresent respondents who speak mostly Spanish, a group that leans more toward Democrats. And other surveys show less reason for Democratic concern.

The most recent national Quinnipiac University poll, for instance, put Trump's Latino approval at 27 percent -- almost exactly equal to his vote among them -- and in Monday's weekly Gallup average, just 23 percent of Latinos approved. A recent Latino Decisions poll in 61 competitive House districts, conducted for a consortium of civil rights advocacy groups, found Democrats holding a roughly 40-percentage-point advantage among Latino voters.

Trump is 'in the strongman tradition'

Amandi says that despite these mixed signals in polling, he sees evidence that Trump and the GOP have maintained a beachhead of support among Latinos.

"My instant analysis is it's because of the economy," he says. "These are people who are not necessarily paying attention to every inning of political baseball. They are working. They are maybe getting a little bit more money."

Moreover, Amandi says, even Trump's belligerent style has found an audience among some Latinos, especially older men: "He's in the strongman tradition of the Latin American caudillo."

Yet Barreto's poll for the coalition of civil rights groups still found that about three-fourths of Latinos opposed both the border wall and Trump's now-abandoned "zero tolerance" policy and nearly 90 percent supported legal status for the "Dreamers." Barreto says the only reason Republican performance among Latinos might look relatively stronger in current surveys -- or on Election Day itself -- is if turnout among them remains low. The reason is that Latinos who lean Republican also tend to be older -- and thus more reliable voters in low-turnout elections.

"I have not seen any data that I would consider an accurate reflection of Latinos that Republicans are increasing (their share), or they will be over 25 percent of those voters," Barreto says. "The only reason it would be different is not that they are winning over more people; it would be if some Latinos who are Democratically leaning stay home."

Recent history offers evidence for that argument. In the House races during the low-turnout midterm elections of 2010 and 2014, Republicans won a higher share of Latino voters -- 38 percent and 36 percent, respectively -- than they did in House contests during the higher-turnout presidential years of 2016, 2012 and 2008 (from 30 to 32 percent), according to exit polls.

What about turnout?

That contrast highlights what remains the biggest concern about Latinos among Democratic strategists: Will they vote in sufficient numbers? In the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, Latino turnout plummeted from its levels in the presidential elections just two years earlier: While about half of eligible Latinos voted in each of those presidential elections, a low number to begin with, the figure fell to under one-third in 2010 and a little over one-fourth in 2014.

Turnout among Latinos remained essentially stagnant at just under 50 percent in 2016 despite all of Trump's harsh rhetoric at the community. Barreto says his survey found a high level of anger at Trump among Latinos, especially younger generations, and he argues that anger has been a good predictor of heightened turnout. On the other hand, public surveys measuring how closely voters are following the election and whether they are certain to vote have mostly found Latinos still lagging other groups.

Poring over such ambiguous evidence, Henry Fernandez, a principal at the African American Research Collaborative, which studies issues relating to black voters, says the direction of Latino turnout this fall is not yet clear.

He says the increased Republican reliance on racially confrontational messages in the Trump era -- such as comments about the Central American gang MS-13 during the Virginia governor's race last fall -- has clearly prompted a backlash among African-American voters, who "respond most strongly" to any political argument that targets racial divisions, even if they are not the direct subject of the attacks.

Even though the MS-13 attacks failed to lift Republican Ed Gillespie during the Virginia race, the barrage of ads in Tuesday's Ohio special House election accusing Democrat Danny O'Connor of supporting "amnesty for illegals" and "open borders" makes clear that Republicans are committed to stressing racially infused immigration themes through the fall.

Whether that provokes a surge in Latino participation, Fernandez said, may turn on how the nonpartisan groups and Democratic organizations working on turnout respond.

"If the focus of the parties and those organizations is on the predictable electorate, that would be a mistake," he said during a recent conference call with reporters to release the Latino Decisions survey. "There are many more people who are at play who could be potential voters. It's not just a question of what will those folks do on their own, but where will investments be made to encourage people to get out to vote?"
__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Kenya's former 400m hurdles world champion, Nicholas Bett, has died after a car crash Wednesday.

Local police commander Patrick Wambani reported that Bett, aged 28, was killed after his car struck a bump and veered off the road near Nandi County in Kenya's high-altitude North Rift region.

Bett had only just returned home from the African Senior Championships in Nigeria on Monday.

__label__world (CNN) China could overtake Australia as the biggest donor to Pacific nations, but only if Beijing follows through on its promises of aid and support that are currently billions of dollars short of being realized.

Despite pledging a similar amount of money to Australia, concerns remain over how many Chinese commitments actually translate into reality, and the type of loans extended by Beijing to poorer nations.

According to a new project from Australia's Lowy Institute , a foreign policy think tank, China has pledged around $5.88 billion worth of aid to the Pacific since 2011, less than Australia's $6.72 billion. During the same period, the US committed $1.36 billion in aid to the Pacific.

The Lowy project was supported by Australian Aid, a government agency.

While Canberra is still the biggest player in the region, ongoing major spending under Belt and Road -- a colossal trade and investment project spanning 68 countries -- could see Beijing leapfrog it. In Papua New Guinea alone, China has pledged billions of dollars to build roads and other projects , some of which is not reflected in the Lowy data because the deals are in their early stages.

Whether Beijing's promises and highly publicized memorandums of understanding actually translate into anything on the ground is another matter however. During the 2011-2018 period, only around 21% of the money China pledged was actually spent, compared to 97% for Australia.

While China's aid commitments would see it overtake Australia in the near future, Jonathan Pryke, director of Lowy's Pacific Islands Program, was skeptical if actual spending would ever match Beijing's promises.

"China is talking a big game in terms of its commitments to the region and that's concentrated on one country, Papua New Guinea," he said. "I'm not convinced China will (overtake) Australia. We have a much broader, much deeper degree of engagement than China has."

Earlier this year, Australia's Minister for International Development and the Pacific Concetta Fierravanti-Wells accused Beijing of constructing "useless buildings" and roads that "(don't) go anywhere" while loading unsustainable debt onto poorer countries.

"It's really important for investment to be productive that it actually has some economic dividend," she said . "Burdensome debt can divert scarce public resources from more immediate needs such as health and education."

Canberra concern

Some in Australia have expressed concern Canberra is losing out in influence to Beijing, as successive conservative governments have cut aid spending to the Pacific as China has upped its involvement.

"China has played an increasing role in the Pacific while (Coalition governments) have increasingly abandoned the region, relentlessly hacking at our aid funding and seeing an $11 billion cut to the development budget," opposition Labor senator Penny Wong said in January . "Pacific island neighbors have felt the impact of these cuts."

Pryke said that "if there's an upside to Chinese engagement in the Pacific, other than bringing resources for development, it's forcing Australians and New Zealanders to up their game."

Australia has become increasingly gripped by concerns over Chinese influence in the country, and relations between Beijing and Canberra have deteriorated around the passage of an anti-foreign influence laws seen as targeting China.

A series of angry editorials and opinion pieces in Chinese state media when the laws were first introduced labeled them "disgraceful" and "absurd," while Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang in February urged Australia to "abandon the cold-war mentality and ideological bias, stop making irresponsible remarks and work with China to promote the sound and steady development of China-Australia relations on the basis of mutual trust, equality and mutual benefit."

In April, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull expressed concern over unconfirmed reports that China planned to build a military base on the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, some 2,500 kilometers (1,553 miles) from the Australian coast.

Vanuatu is one of several Pacific nations that, like PNG, have seen China increasingly outspending Australia in terms of assistance -- or promising to, at least. Both China and Vanuatu denied in May that they'd ever been in talks over a military base.

While Canberra may be uneasy about a potential Chinese military presence near its borders, for its part, China has expressed concern over Australia's involvement in the South China Sea, which Beijing regards as Chinese territory.

Beijing build up

Concerns over the amount of debt Beijing loads onto recipient countries have been raised outside of the Pacific.

A report last year found that China was poised to replace the US as the primary donor to the developing world , as Washington has pulled back from aid spending under President Donald Trump.

Over the period 2000-2014, China spent almost as much as the US, AidData executive director Brad Parks told CNN in October, "but the color of the money -- even though they're providing roughly comparable amounts -- is very different."

Much of the aid did not match OECD criteria for official development assistance -- the type of spending most people think of with regard to overseas aid -- and had "no detectable effect on economic growth," AidData found.

Lowy's Pryke said that Chinese projects are far larger and more headline-grabbing compared to other donors.

"The average size of an Australian aid project is a tenth of the size of a Chinese project. Whereas China has about 200 projects, Australia has over 4,000, so that gives you a sense of how spread out we are," he said.

Given in the form of loans, such projects can create onerous commitments for developing nations, which may struggle to pay them back even as they see no tangible benefits.

In June , China's Ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye dismissed such concerns as "absurd."

Speaking with regard to the Pacific, Cheng said "we have always been sensitive to any possible debt burden and any items that we have in cooperation with those countries, we are very careful about their ability to come back to the debt."

The biggest concern for China hawks in Australia is that highly indebted projects in neighboring Pacific nations will go the way of Sri Lanka's Hambantota port.

__label__world (CNN) Across the African continent, drones are finding innovative uses -- from monitoring displaced populations, to delivering critical medical supplies.

Moroccan technology startup ATLAN Space is developing artificial intelligence (AI) to guide autonomous drones so they can scan large areas for "environmental crimes" like illegal fishing , poaching or deforestation.

In June, ATLAN Space won the National Geographic Society's $150,000 Marine Protection Prize to implement a pilot project to combat illegal fishing in the Seychelles.

Drones will be armed with information about illegal fishing hotspots, explains Badr Idrissi, CEO and co-founder of ATLAN Space.

Once a drone detects a boat, AI will enable it to verify whether it is a cruising boat, tanker or fishing vessel. The drone will then establish whether the boat is operating inside a marine protected area, and if it is an authorized fishing vessel.

If it concludes that the activity is illegal, the drone will register the boat's location, identification number, and number of people on board and relay this information to authorities via satellite.

Currently governments employ light aircraft or coast guard vessels for this kind of surveillance.

"With artificial intelligence we are able to replace the pilot, the data analyst, transmission equipment, and with that we can reduce the cost," says Idrissi, a former account manager at Microsoft.

He adds that using drones guided by AI would relieve coast guards from their monitoring duties and allow them to focus on intercepting vessels.

According to Idrissi, ATLAN Space technology can be integrated in any type of drone. He says the operational range could reach up to 800 kilometers when using drones equipped with a combustion engine.

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a drone powered by artificial intelligence.

Idrissi, 37 and co-founder Younes Moumen, 35, both based in Rabat, started developing the technology when they learned that illegal fishing costs coastal countries in West Africa approximately $2.3 billion every year.

"We consider ourselves a partner of government to build a sustainable solution to the issues and challenges they are facing," Idrissi says.

Drones for good

ATLAN Space is one of many startups innovating with drone technology on the continent.

In Rwanda, drones deliver vital medical supplies like blood and vaccines to remote areas.

They are also used for critical humanitarian missions, like mapping displaced people in Niger, Burkina Faso and Uganda.

In Lilongwe, Malawi, UNICEF partnered with the government to set up a testing corridor in 2017 to investigate how drones can be used for humanitarian work.

Over the past year, universities and private sector companies have used drones to map cholera outbreaks and mosquito breeding sites in the corridor.

"The idea is to see what's working in Malawi and be able to scale the solutions to a global level," UNICEF's Michael Scheibenreif tells CNN.

"Drones will substantially change our way of working in Africa," says Scheibenreif. "As a leapfrog technology they can help us to deliver goods like medicine quickly ... in places where developed transportation networks or roads do not exist."

Sky's the limit?

But drone expert and World Bank Consultant Frederick Mbuya, who has previously worked on drone mapping projects in Tanzania and Zanzibar , cautions that drones, while hugely effective in land surveying and delivery of medical supplies, are not always the silver bullet they're hyped up to be.

"Drones have a huge potential to impact Africa, and not just the rich, all areas of Africa," he tells CNN. "But a lot of work needs to be done."

As of July 2017, only 14 African countries had dedicated drone regulations, according to an African Union report

But Mbuya stresses that often these regulations are too restrictive and exorbitant licensing fees can price local startups and operators out of the market.

He adds that if drone technology is going to change Africa, Africans have to be able to enter business using the technology and profit.

Idrissi agrees that drone technology and startups should be homegrown.

"We are based in Morocco because we believe Africa has reached maturity to build solutions that can really tackle the challenges and issues that Africa is facing," he says.
__label__world (CNN) Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has called for the Chinese government to tone down its behavior in the South China Sea, warning ongoing tensions could spark an accidental conflict.

Speaking Tuesday at the Malacanang Palace in Manila, Duterte said the heavily-contested region could become a "flashpoint."

"I hope that China would temper at least its behavior. I do not want to quarrel with China," he added.

The Philippines and China have been engaged in territorial disputes over parts of the South China Sea for decades, along with Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.

Beijing claims an enormous swathe of territory in the region, and has heavily-fortified artificial islands under its control in the Spratly and Paracel chains.
__label__world Jerusalem (CNN) Peter Beinart wasn't the first one stopped at Ben Gurion Airport, but the progressive American Jew and CNN political commentator is one of a growing list of big names who say they were detained while trying to enter Israel and quizzed on their political leanings.

In an article in The Forward , a monthly American Jewish magazine and online news outlet, Beinart wrote that he was at the airport's passport check with his family on Sunday when he was asked to step aside for extra screening.

"Then the political questions began. Was I involved in any organization that could provoke violence in Israel? I said no. Was I involved in any organization that threatens Israel democracy? I said no -- that I support Israeli organizations that employ non-violence to defend Israeli democracy."

Writing of his interrogator, Beinart, who is also a professor of journalism and political science at the City University of New York, concluded, "He established no consistent or objective standard for my detention. His standard was whether I planned to cause trouble -- trouble meaning whatever he and his superiors wanted it to mean."

Well, here we go... I'm at the border after a weekend in Sinai and Israeli authorities have detained me and my friend Abby for the last three hours. We are being questioned solely about our political opinions and activities vis a vis Palestinians esp in the occupied territories

One week earlier, Simone Zimmerman, a former adviser to Bernie Sanders and co-founder of If Not Now, which opposes Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories, tweeted about her own experience at Israel's border crossing with Sinai.

"We are being questioned solely about our political opinions and activities vis a vis Palestinians," Zimmerman wrote after spending a weekend in Sinai. She says was detained by Israeli authorities for four hours, during which she was asked why she worked with Palestinians and not Jews. Zimmerman, an American Jew, currently lives in Israel, doing work for a human rights organization on a work visa.

"The scariest part is the horrifying realization of how badly the Israeli government wants to scare Jews away from Palestinians," Zimmerman said. "They are using all tactics to make the cost of knowing & working with Palestinians too risky that we don't dare to do it at all."

The Israel Security Agency (ISA) denied questioning her about her political beliefs.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Beinart's detention an "administrative mistake" and told Israel's security forces to "inquire how this happened" in a statement released by his office on Monday.

"Israel is an open society which welcomes all -- critics and supporters alike. Israel is the only country in the Middle East where people voice their opinions freely and robustly," he said.

Zimmerman received no such statement acknowledging her detention.

Reza Aslan, seen here in a 2009 photo, says he was inspired by Beinart's story to recount his detention at the Israeli border.

Neither did Reza Aslan, a former CNN contributor, religious scholar and author who, inspired by Beinart's story, wrote on Twitter about his own detention at the border crossing with Jordan two weeks ago.

Aslan said the first question he was asked was: "You think because you're a public person I can't do whatever I want with you?"

"I was floored. This is how interrogations begin in police states," Aslan wrote. Aslan says he was told to write down the names of Palestinians and journalists he knows.

Aslan says he was repeatedly threatened with the same warning: "If you don't cooperate it will be a long time before you see your kids again."

In a statement, the ISA said Aslan was detained because his behavior aroused suspicion. After a "short" investigation, the ISA said, he was released. The ISA denied posing any political questions or threatening Aslan. "It was found that [the threats] had no basis whatsoever and they have no base in reality," the ISA said in a statement, adding that ISA actions are done "according to the law."

On social media, Aslan, Zimmerman and Beinart went on to share stories of others being detained.

Israeli Member of Knesset Nachman Shai, from the opposition Labor party, has demanded an investigation into what he called "blacklists" and the basis for the detentions. In a letter to the State Comptroller's Office and the Attorney General, Shai wrote, "I have no idea how these lists were formulated or who is on them. This is reminiscent of the darkest totalitarian regimes."

"I want to know who made those lists and according to which criteria and what is behind them," Shai told CNN. "There are lists with Interpol and terrorist lists, but who builds these lists? How did Peter Beinhart get into the list? If he called somewhere for a boycott on the settlements, does it mean that he is not allowed to come to Israel? That's crazy."

A spokeswoman for the ISA denied the existence of a blacklist. "When you are coming to Israel there is a security check that happens like it does in every country," said the spokeswoman, "and during the security check there are indeed criteria, there is intelligence which exists, and there is some kind of process which allows citizens to come into the state of Israel."

The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), a human rights organization, wrote a letter of complaint about the border detentions to the Attorney General's office, arguing the detentions by the Shin Bet, also known as the Israel Security Agency, are not related to security.

"Shin Bet appears to have abused the border control officers at the airport, and its own presence at the site, for purposes that have nothing to do with preventing attacks on Israeli aviation or with supervising the security arrangements at the site," wrote a lawyer for ACRI.

In a response, the Attorney General's office said it would inquire with the ISA about the detentions.

The border detentions follow Israel's decision earlier this year to bar entry to organizations that promote a boycott of the country. In January, Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs published a list of 20 organizations that would be banned from entering the country.

At the time, Minister Gilad Erdan said: "The anti-Israel boycott campaign seeks not to promote peace but to undermine Israel's national security and existence. The state of Israel will prevent groups working to undermine its security and core interests from entering Israel."
__label__world Beijing (CNN) China has unveiled a new lunar rover as it prepares to become the first nation in the world to explore the far side of the moon later this year.

Revealed at a press conference Wednesday, the unmanned vehicle is 1.5 meters (5 feet) long and about one meter (3.3 feet) wide and tall, with two foldable solar panels and six wheels.

China announced its intentions in 2015 to send a rover to the far side of the moon. In May this year, it launched a relay satellite to establish a communication link between Earth and the planned lunar probe.

The country's last lunar rover -- named Yutu, or Jade Rabbit -- ceased operation in August 2016 after 972 days of service on the surface of the moon as part of the Chang'e 3 mission. China was only the third nation to successfully carry out a lunar landing, after the United States and Russia.

Yutu's successor is currently nameless, with a global competition underway to choose a moniker. The winner will receive $435 and tickets to watch the launch live.

__label__world Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) At least 34 people were killed in a suicide attack targeting an education center in Kabul Wednesday, according to a government official. Among the victims were thought to be dozens of teenagers studying English.

Wahid Majroh, a spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health had earlier released a higher death toll of 48. He later revised that figure down. Dozens were also injured.

The attack on the Maw'ood education center in Dasht e Barchi area of the Afghan capital, came at 4 p.m. local time (7.30 a.m. ET), Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said.

Hamid Rafeh, the brother of 17-year-old victim Rahila told CNN that he saw "dozens" of dead and wounded when he arrived at the scene at around 4.15 p.m. -- shortly after the attack took place.

__label__world Genoa, Italy (CNN) Unknown numbers of people were still missing two days after a highway bridge in northern Italy gave way , authorities said, as experts warned Thursday that thousands of other bridges in Italy could be at risk of collapse.

The number of cars on the collapsed section of the bridge -- and the number of people that were in them -- is still unclear to those working on the ground, Chief of Fire Services Emmanuel Gissi said.

"We also don't know the capacity of each car," Gissi said. "There could be one person or five. The only way to find out is to break the concrete, remove it, and then send in the dogs."

The death toll has been revised to 38, which had previously been 39, according to a spokesman for the Civil Protection press office.

The revised number of fatalities was due to an error cause by "confusion and internal miscommunications," the spokesman said. The figure is not categorized as final at this time and authorities continue to warn that the death toll may rise.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced a 12-month state of emergency for the city of Genoa on Wednesday night and pledged €5 million to tackle the immediate costs of the search-and-rescue efforts.

Those efforts were continuing at the rescue site Thursday, where several cranes -- dwarfed by towering blocks of concrete debris -- were seen sifting through chunks of rubble.

The victims will be remembered at a joint funeral in Genoa on Saturday, which Conte has proclaimed as a day of national mourning.

Also on Thursday, the Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport announced the creation of an inspection commission to carry out technical checks and analysis in an investigation into the cause of the collapse. The commission will have 30 days to provide the minister with a detailed report on the collapse.

'Hundreds or thousands' of bridges at risk

Experts are now warning that the collapse of the Morandi Bridge -- a vital link of the A10 highway that connects northwest Italy to France and one of the busiest bridges in Italy -- is a sign of far more serious failings in the maintenance of bridges across the country.

"All Italian bridges made of concrete between the 1950s and 1960s have come to the end of their life," Settimo Martinello, director of 4EMME Service, a company that carries out inspections and checks on the state of 50,000 bridges in Italy, told CNN on Thursday. "They're not eternal."

"There are hundreds, thousands rather, of bridges at risk of collapse," he said, adding that the exact number is unknown and that the biggest problem is a lack of information about the 1.5 million or so bridges in Italy.

The responsibility for maintaining those bridges is split among local administrations and several private and public bodies -- including Autostrade, which had the contract for maintenance on the A10 motorway -- and only around 60,000 are monitored regularly, Martinello said.

"While a collapse like the one in Genoa is quite rare, there are about 15 to 20 bridges collapsing every year in the country," he said.

Martinello's warnings echoed a statement released Tuesday by Antonio Occhiuzzi, director of the Institute of Technology of Constructions at the National Council of Research, Italy's biggest public research body.

"In practice, tens of thousands of bridges in Italy have exceeded, today, the lifespan for which they were designed and built, according to a balance between costs and needs of national reconstruction after World War II and the durability of the works," Occhiuzzi said.

He called for many Italian bridges to be replaced with structures with a lifespan of 100 years, saying that the costs of the "extraordinary maintenance" required to keep existing bridges functional would in many cases exceed those involved with demolition and reconstruction.

Some of the residential buildings beneath the remaining sections of the bridge will be demolished, according to a spokesman for Marco Bucci, mayor of Genoa.

Leading politicians have blamed Autostrade for the Genoa disaster. Conte announced Wednesday that his government would revoke the concession from the company, while Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli has called for senior managers there to resign. Shares in Autostrade were down 24% Thursday.

Stefano Marigliani, a senior executive at Autostrade in charge of the part of the toll road network linking the French and Italian Rivieras that includes the bridge, told the Financial Times that the structure "was monitored constantly beyond legal requirements" and that there was "no reason to consider it dangerous."

Soon after the incident, it emerged that locals and experts had been warning about the state of the bridge for years.

Antonio Brencich of the engineering faculty at the University of Genoa sounded the alarm in 2016, calling the structure an "engineering failure" in an interview with broadcaster Primocanale.

It is unclear what authorities plan to do with the remaining sections of the bridge. According to a spokesman for the regional government, more than 300 families -- a total of 610 people -- have been evacuated from residential buildings beneath the structure, parts of which still loom ominously above the apartment buildings.

Some of those buildings will need to be demolished, a spokesman for Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci said Thursday, but he did not give an exact number.
__label__politics (CNN) Weeks after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to bring families separated at the border back together, a Salvadoran woman has filed a federal lawsuit in Washington asking to be reunited with her infant daughter who needs to be breastfed.

Leydi Duenas-Claros also seeks a halt to her deportation proceedings and wants the government to reconsider her denied asylum claim.

"We are waiting to go before a judge and will be able to comment more at a later time," said Claudia O'Brien, an attorney for Duenas.

Duenas was set to be deported on Thursday, but O'Brien was told the proceedings were postponed.

In May, Duenas, 30, came to the United States with her then-11-month-old daughter, one of her five children who by birth are US citizens, to seek asylum, the lawsuit says. They were separated after she and her child crossed the border.

__label__politics (CNN) The Republican National Committee on Thursday took a heavy swipe at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- the 28-year-old Latina who unseated a long-serving Democratic congressman in New York's June primary -- comparing her to Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro.

A Bronx native with Puerto Rican roots, Ocasio-Cortez is a democratic socialist and -- as of less than two months ago -- a leading figure on the progressive left, which has notched a handful of high-profile Democratic primary wins in 2018 while advocating for programs like "Medicare-for-all" and tuition-free college.

In their email, the RNC calls Ocasio-Cortez the "Mini-Maduro Foreboding The Future Of Democrats" and says she is "leading The Democrat Party To The Left With Nothing More Than An Unsubstantiated, Factually Incorrect Socialist Wish List."

Maduro is the successor to Hugo Chávez, who ruled from 1999 to 2013. His government is nominally socialist, but with Maduro's assorted power grabs and silencing of critics, Venezuela is not governed democratically. It is currently in the grips of a devastating economic and political collapse owing in large part to a drop in oil prices.

Conservative critics, especially online, routinely reference Venezuela's dire state of affairs when arguing against progressive left policies.

__label__world Beijing (CNN) A visit by Taiwan's President has left a popular bakery caught between two increasingly adversarial governments in Beijing and Taipei.

The Taiwanese chain, 85C, became an overnight pariah in mainland China after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen visited one of its stores in Los Angeles on Sunday during a stopover on her diplomatic trip to South America.

According to the company's website, 85C has almost 600 outlets in China.

The bakery's efforts to make peace failed to placate Beijing and have instead angered their customers in Taiwan, where some angry citizens have accused it of "kowtowing" to the Chinese government.

85C is just the latest business caught in the escalating political crossfire between Beijing and Taipei, which has swept up global car manufacturers and many international airlines.

__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Five months ago Jessica Osita had never used a computer, sent an email or even browsed the internet, yet she is part of a team of five teenagers who have just won a major tech award in California.

Despite their limited tech knowledge, the Nigerian teens learned how to build a mobile app from scratch by using opensource software from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The app, called FD-Detector, helps users identify fake medicines using a drug's barcode to verify its authenticity and expiration date.

"I feel very excited and relieved. I'm extremely proud of myself," Osita, 15, told CNN from San Francisco, in the group's first interview since they won the 2018 Technovation Challenge on 9 August.

Named Team Save-A-Soul -- Promise Nnalue, Jessica Osita, Nwabuaku Ossai, Adaeze Onuigbo and Vivian Okoye -- spent five months researching and building the app and hope it can be a solution to the widespread sale of counterfeit drugs in Nigeria.

For Osita, there was a more personal, poignant reason for creating the app -- her brother died after fake drugs were administered to him following an accident.

"My brother died from fake drugs. I'm very motivated by the death of my brother to solve this problem," she said.

"With this app, we will relieve the burden. I feel very excited," said Osita, who has ambitions to become a pharmacist. "I want to produce genuine drugs," she says.

Osita and her four other teammates beat teams from the US, Spain, Turkey, Uzbekistan and China in the finals to secure the top spot in the junior category at the competition.

"Some people told me 'you're a girl, why are you going into tech?'" said Osita. "At first my parents didn't understand what I was doing, but it's only recently that they see what I'm doing. They are very, very proud."

Since their win, they have been feted and the world's media has been clamoring to interview them.

Winners of 2018 Silicon Valley contest, Promise Nnalue, Jessica Osita, Nwabuaku Ossai, Adaeze Onuigbo and Vivian Okoye pose with their mentor Uchenna Ugwu.

One of her teammates Promise Nnalue, 14, told CNN: "People are calling us celebrities and taking pictures with us. I'm very happy. We could not have done this without our mentor. She really believed in us and encouraged us," said Nnalue, who aspires to become a doctor.

Speaking to the teenagers it is clear that their mentor Uchenna Ugwu has had a profound impact on their lives.

Ugwu was the one who introduced them to computers and coding through her Edufun Technik organization, which teaches STEM to underprivileged children in Anambra State, southeastern Nigeria.

Ugwu says her organization has taught approximately 4,800 school children since 2014 -- over 60% of whom have been young girls -- as a means of closing the widening gender gap in STEM education.

"This is the first interview I'm granting," Ugwu told CNN from San Francisco where she says they are still in shock from the win.

"I'm overwhelmed. It was a beautiful experience for them. They have experienced so many firsts. They were entering a flight for the first time. The girls were scared and overwhelmed. They asked me 'How can we compete with these countries who have been using tech for a very long time?'

"I told them 'it's not how long ago you started, but how well you do.' I'm so proud of them because they were so determined to learn," she said. "They were not the most talented in the coding class but they were the most determined. They stuck with the classes when a lot of their peers dropped out," she added.

Ugwu, a mother-of three, said they practiced their pitch endlessly, and it was their effort and passion that helped them win.

"The girls really impressed a lot of people," she said. "To be honest, every progress we made was a win to me.

"They have come very far qualifying out of more than 2,000 apps submitted. They are winners in every way," she said.

"Five months ago, they didn't have access to the internet or how to write an email. They could not believe that they had the opportunity to touch the almighty computer. It's amazing."

Technovation is run by education nonprofit Iridescent and challenges girls aged 10-18 to create an app that solves problems in their communities.

"It is inspiring seeing the hard work and determination of girls around the world working to solve big challenges in their communities with smart solutions," Iridescent founder Tara Chklovski said in a statement.

The teenage girls will partner with the Nigeria's drug regulatory agency, Technovation's organizers said.

Ugwu hopes this win will encourage other young girls to tackle some of the problems Nigeria is facing.

"The next thing is to use this moment to inspire more girls. How do we leverage on this to build our nation? How do we inspire other girls to start thinking about solutions to our problems? We need to let young people know that they are the solutions to their problems, if we do that Nigeria will be better."
__label__politics WASHINGTON (CNN) Four in 10 Americans see Russia as an enemy of the United States, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, the largest share to say so since CNN polls began asking the question in 1999. And nearly 6 in 10 say Donald Trump has been too friendly toward Russia.

Trump's diplomatic foibles in managing the US' relationship with major allies hasn't done much to change the public's views of those allies. Broad majorities see Great Britain (90%), France (90%) and Germany (85%) as allies or at least friendly to the US, and three-quarters say the same about Israel (75%), all largely unchanged since before Trump's time in office.

But the share who see North Korea, Iran and Russia as enemies has grown. Overall, 59% call North Korea an enemy (up from 55% in 2014 and the most to say so since CNN first asked in 2000) and 41% consider Russia an enemy of the US (up from 25% saying so in 2014 and a high since the measure was first taken in 1999).

Both those shifts follow high-profile meetings between the President and the leaders of those countries, and in the poll, are largely due to increases in the share of Democrats considering the country an enemy. On Russia, 56% of Democrats call Russia an enemy, up from 20% in 2014, and on North Korea, 61% of Democrats now consider it an enemy, up from 53% in 2014.

__label__world (CNN) Kofi Annan has been described as "Africa's foremost son," as well as "a tall Iroko tree" whose achievement as the first black African to lead the UN is a source of pride to many on the continent.

A master mediator who was keen on flying the flag for peace around the world -- and was jointly awarded a Nobel Peace Prize with the UN in 2001 for his efforts -- Annan brokered a crucial truce in the bloody aftermath of the Kenyan election violence in 2007.

One Twitter user wrote on hearing of his death Saturday: "Were it not for you, our country would have been brought down to ashes."

Every kenyan Remembers Annan during his peace movements in Kenya in 2007/2008. Were it not for you, our country would have been brought down to ashes, We celebrate and Loved You Annan, You have a place not only in Kenyans hearts But also the entire world. Rest in Peace Annan — CYMoH ™ 🌬🇰🇪 ||Jesus Saves|| (@ProfCymOh254_) August 18, 2018

In February 2008, Annan led a mediation effort in Kenya after elections in the east African nation descended into chaos. Violence had broken out after Kenya's former President Mwai Kibaki was declared winner of the 2007 presidential polls against opposition leader Raila Odinga.

Around 600 people were killed after marauding youths armed with spears, bows, arrows and machetes destroyed homes around the town of Eldoret, near the border with Uganda.
__label__world (CNN) Tommy Frenck is the proud owner and proprietor of The Golden Lion, a traditional, half-timbered guesthouse surrounded by meadows in a small village in central Germany.

Schnitzel topped with a fried egg is the specialty here, but his patrons come for more than food and drink: they come to share what they call "patriotic" views.

"I bought the guesthouse because we could not go into the other guesthouses," says Frenck. "Every time the police or other people would kick us out: 'Don't let the right-wing in! Don't let the Nazis in!'"

Germany has seen a resurgence in far-right sentiment over the last few years, along with the rapid rise of the anti-immigration, anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD). But few embrace their political identity as flamboyantly as Frenck, whose neck is tattooed with the word "Aryan."

"I am proud of my nation. I am proud of my heritage," he says. "That's the thing in Germany: if you are proud of your heritage, you are the bad guy... Every person who's not politically correct is somehow a 'Nazi.'"

Tommy Frenck runs a guesthouse in rural Germany where he serves "Hitler schnitzels" and sells far-right merchandise.

Frenck bought the guesthouse in 2015 not just as a place for like-minded citizens but also as a warehouse for his growing business in Nazi merchandise, much of which barely skirts Germany's stringent hate speech laws.

The place is decorated with World War II memorabilia, including the German imperial flag and a row of liquors named after tank, air force and SS commanders.

On a top shelf, a wooden doll has its arm permanently raised in a Nazi salute and several cushion covers are printed with "I heart HTLR" logos.

And with the AfD surging in Germany, the pub is far from alone in spreading its message to far-right supporters, despite Germany's criminal code prohibiting the public use of "symbols of unconstitutional organizations" -- that includes the swastika, the Celtic cross, the Nazi salute and other symbols associated with the Nazi Party.

Punishment can range from fines to three years in prison. As a result, far-right supporters have developed a coded language, in which Frenck is fluent.

Among Frenck's merchandise are baseball caps, T-shirts and mugs with slogans referencing Adolf Hitler.

One T-shirt reads "88," signifying "HH" or "Heil Hitler" (H being the 8th letter of the alphabet). Every April 20 -- Adolf Hitler's birthday -- customers at the guesthouse can enjoy a "HTLR SCHNTZL" for 8.88 euros.

According to Frenck, sales of his products have grown 10% since the beginning of 2016, coinciding with the arrival of more than 1 million refugees in Germany in 2015.

And his customers are not all tattooed, middle-aged men. On the day CNN visits, a family from the southern state of Baden-Württemberg is also visiting with their primary-school-aged daughter. She picks out a pink "Little German" T-shirt and pays with her pocket money, fishing around in her purse for the right coins.

Her mother, who does not want to be named, says the family makes a point of visiting the guesthouse every year.

"We come here because this is what we think," she told CNN, "This is how we want to live."

Politics must be 'for the German people'

Frenck wants to stop immigration to Germany and ban Islam. He voted for the AfD in last year's federal elections, when the party won 12.6% of the vote nationally -- and 22.5% in Frenck's home state of Thuringia.

Echoing the party's politicians -- who now occupy 92 seats in the country's parliament -- he says he is not a white supremacist, but just doesn't like globalization and the mixing of cultures.

"Most important for me is that the German government makes politics for German people and not for the European Union or refugees in Africa," he says. "They have to be for the German people."

He points to his world map of travels, studded with pins across Asia and the Middle East.

"I love all these countries and I have friends all over the world! I like the food there. The thing is, they want to make from all these nice cultures just one culture. You know what I mean?"

Across Europe, such views are becoming more common, and those who hold them more vocal. Anti-immigration politicians in former Soviet bloc nations such as Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban -- who in February likened immigration to a "flu epidemic" -- have been joined by party leaders in countries such as Denmark, France and Austria, previously considered bastions of liberalism.

Far-right parties are gaining ground across much of the continent, and are now in power in Italy, Austria and Hungary.

"We are currently engaged in a political cultural struggle in Europe," said Hajo Funke, professor of political science at Berlin's Free University. "We have this right-wing shift in parts of (the continent)."

He believes German Chancellor Angela Merkel has resisted this shift, by refusing to form a coalition with the AfD and by defying the attempts of her interior minister to drift to the right on immigration.

Her approach "represents a middle course," he said. "And this middle course is what the majority wants."

Frenck insists his controversial products break no laws.

Far-right concerts are 'dangerous for society'

While central government may be holding a relatively steady centrist course, the impact of right-wingers such as Frenck (and his merchandise) is a big concern for some Germans.

"Superficially, some of the T-shirts try to be funny," says Stefan Herdegen, a local activist who monitors far-right extremist groups in Thuringia. "They are not funny. They are serious because they promote Nazi ideas to people. And that is dangerous."

He's also concerned about the music festivals Frenck organizes in the state each year.

"These events are dangerous, not only because there have been violent incidents reported, but because of their political nature they are dangerous for society. Neo-Nazi content is spread here."

Frenck's activities have put him on the radar of local police. The domestic intelligence service in Thuringia became especially concerned last year when Frenck organized a "Rock for Identity" music festival that attracted around 6,000 people, according to a statement sent to CNN by the domestic intelligence service in Thuringia.

Festivalgoers are seen at the music festival organized by Frenck in June 2018.

Following heavy criticism of their tactics at that event, police took a tougher approach at this year's event -- a "Day of Identity" concert in June featuring far-right heavy metal bands and guest speakers from the AfD.

Fewer than 2,500 people came, according to police, attendance dampened by rain and an overwhelming police presence that cut off road traffic to the event.

Police said they recorded 84 violations at the concert, some of which were hate speech offenses including the display of banned symbols -- but one journalist was also punched in the face by a concert-goer.

Funke is concerned that authorities have allowed Frenck too long a leash in the past and was pleased to see more police intervention at this year's concert. "But more can always be done," he said.

Frenck knows he is monitored by police but insists he has broken no laws and has no criminal record. He says that police concerns about his music festivals are overblown and that he was happy with this year's turnout.

"For me, it was a good business day. We had people from Switzerland, Norway, some Swedes, also Poland, Hungary and Russia," he says, rifling through a guestbook in which concert-goers left messages.

"We're hoping that at the next event, police will stop searching us before going in to listen to bands. It just intimidates us and keeps people from attending."

He's planning another event this summer and also has a fresh batch of designs and new products for his online business, including a set of queen-size bedsheets emblazoned with the German imperial flag.

"I am a regular guy who pays his taxes like anyone else. I am not doing anything wrong," he says. "If people label me as a Nazi it's not my problem."

__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Nigeria has narrowly escaped an international football ban after its government responded to a FIFA ultimatum shortly before a suspension took effect on Monday.

FIFA had issued a statement saying it would suspend Nigeria at 11 am GMT Monday because of a power struggle over the leadership of the Nigeria National Federation, known as the NFF.

Amaju Pinnick was elected head of the NFF in 2014. However, while he was at the World Cup with Nigeria's Super Eagles team, another faction took over the federation's headquarters.

The faction was led by sports administrator Chris Giwa who says he is the rightful leader because of a court ruling in his favor earlier this year.

Nigeria's Sport Minister Solomon Dalung, acting on the court ruling ordered Pinnick and his board to comply with the court and leave the NFF, according to local media reports

However, faced with a FIFA ban for government interference, Nigeria on Monday rejected Giwa's claim to leadership and backed Pinnick instead.

The vice president's media aide, Laolu Akande earlier tweeted: "The FG has already conveyed to FIFA its firm position recognizing Amaju Pinnick-led NFF as the current and only NFF Exco,"

The FG has already conveyed to FIFA its firm position recognizing Amaju Pinnick-led NFF as the current & only NFF Exco. Govt will also continue to work with all relevant stakeholders involved to resolve dispute in a timely manner. FG is upholding NFF treaty obligations to FIFA — Laolu Akande (@akandeoj) August 20, 2018

FIFA later released a statement saying: "FIFA received confirmations that the legitimate leadership of the NFF under President Amaju Melvin Pinnick and General Secretary Mohammed Sanusi has been given back effective control of the NFF and its offices."

It is not the first time that Nigeria has faced a FIFA ban over government interference.

FIFA suspended the country when a high court ordered the NFF to hand over the reins of the national team to a government civil servant after the country's exit from the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

Football is a much-beloved sport in the country, but poor showings at international tournaments by the Super Eagles team have often inspired calls for change and prompted successive governments to interfere in the administration of the sport, a clear breach of FIFA rules, which does not accept government interference in football.

The footballing ruling body says it will continue to monitor the situation in Nigeria to make sure "FIFA rules and regulations are fully adhered to."
__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) For more than a quarter of a century, Nigeria's Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS)-- has taken the lead on the country's most serious crimes — armed robbery, kidnapping, assault, and murder.

But following a months-long social media campaign known as #EndSARS by activists protesting alleged human rights abuses by the squad, Nigeria's acting president has issued an order overhauling the controversial unit.

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo — deputizing while President Muhammadu Buhari was on a working vacation outside Nigeria — said the decision was made following "persistent complaints" and allegations.

Speaking after the announcement last week, he said: "Any unit that emerges from the process will be intelligence-driven and restricted to the prevention and detection of armed robbery and kidnapping, and apprehension of offenders linked to the stated offenses, and nothing more."

Human rights abuses

Osinbajo, a former law professor, also ordered the country's National Human Rights Commission to set up a committee to investigate abuse allegations.

But leading figures from the #EndSARS movement have told CNN that, while they welcome the announcement, they will not stop campaigning until the government sets up an independent complaints commission to address specific cases of misconduct involving law enforcement officers.

A spokesman for Osinbajo, Laolu Akande, told CNN the Nigerian government was taking all allegations seriously, adding, "we want to plead with Nigerians to have more confidence in the reforms that are now being implemented."

Segun Awosanya, a leading figure in the #EndSARS campaign who, along with other activists, started documenting alleged incidents of police brutality months ago, said an overhaul is not enough, the unit must be disbanded.

He told CNN the entire police force must be reformed and any SARS officers found guilty of offenses after the inquiry must answer for their crimes.

"The position of the people... is not negotiable. We are asking for a shutdown of a demonstrably criminal network within the police structure and a general reform in the police," Awosanya said.

Torture of suspects

Warnings about the police unit predate Awosanya's social media campaign.

In 2016, an Amnesty International report into SARS accused officers from the unit of torturing detainees in custody and demanding bribes to free them.

Former detainees told Amnesty they were starved, beaten, shot and subjected to mock executions by officers from the squad.

Amnesty also said it found 130 people detained by SARS in a detention center known as the "Abattoir" — or slaughterhouse — in Abuja, Nigeria's capital city.

The human rights organization accused the Nigerian police of covering up the unit's crimes, saying in the report that no officers had ever faced trial for torturing suspects, let alone any convictions. Police denied to Amnesty that any torture had taken place.

Student live-tweets in police cell

Last month, CNN spoke to an engineering student who covertly documented his experience when he was arrested by SARS officers in June.

Daniel Ekanem, 26, told CNN he was arrested on his way to class when men in uniform asked for his identity card and identified themselves as SARS officers.

Despite showing his photo ID, Ekanem says one of the men pulled his shirt collar, kicked and shoved him across the street into a van.

"Another officer slapped me when I asked why I was being arrested and pushed me into the back of the van alongside others," Ekanem said. "He said if we dare mess up, all of us will get bullets."

Ekanem also told CNN that the officers ordered him to contact his family to ask them to bring a minimum of 30,000 naira ($83) to the station to bail him out.

In a Twitter post, he said men were being punched and slapped by officers in his overcrowded police cell. He also posted a photo of a man he said was beaten over the head with a plank.

This is one of the guys just beaten with plank ok his head... pic.twitter.com/10tcinjVeK — DANIEL DANIEL-EKANEM (@POUNLARS) June 8, 2018

The student says he feared for his life as he watched the men being "beaten mercilessly" by the officers in Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom, in southeast Nigeria.

"I and over 11 others have been taken hostage by SARS accusing us of being cultists," he wrote during a series of frantic tweets from the cell.

Ekanem posted photos along with a plea for help from his hundreds of Twitter followers.

Activists then sent a lawyer to the police station where he was being held to secure his release. Ekanem told CNN he was freed without charge.

I and over 11 others have been taken hostage by SARS. Accusing us of being cultists. We're at IKOT EKPENE area command. They're taking us out to the back 1 by 1 beaten mercilessly and brought back in. I'm hiding n trying to broadcast this. Pls help retweet. @InibeheEffiong HELP pic.twitter.com/lUahDkNfMu — DANIEL DANIEL-EKANEM (@POUNLARS) June 8, 2018

A spokesman for Akwa Ibom police confirmed to CNN that the SARS unit had carried out mass arrests in Ekanem's neighborhood. He said they were investigating an incident in the area.

He denied that money was collected from any of those arrested and added that the highest authorities in the Nigerian police are investigating Ekanem's claims of brutality.

In a separate case, lawyer Bernard Oyabevwe, 33, told CNN he was attacked by SARS officers when he questioned a client's arrest at a police station in Delta State, in the south of the country.

Oyabevwe said he was dragged on the floor and beaten until blood began gushing from his mouth.

Photos of the battered lawyer went viral on social media renewing public anger against police brutality in the country.

Oyabevwe alleged he was beaten by police officers.

"I was beaten by the police, yet I am now being charged to court to defend myself while I am still suffering the injuries I sustained from the assault," Oyabevwe told CNN last month.

A Delta State police spokesman told CNN the lawyer's conduct was not appropriate and the case would have to make its way through the courts.

A reformed unit

Following the interim president's announcement to overhaul the SARS unit on Tuesday, police spokesman Jimoh Moshood said the force was developing new guidelines for SARS operatives.

He said the force has set up an independent panel comprised of human rights activists, senior police officers, and civil societies to regularly address policing activities under the new arrangement.

Awosanya said he and other activists would be closely monitoring to ensure the guidelines are adhered to.

"The campaign against police brutality continues and we need all Nigerians to continue to be vigilant and share their experiences as we continue to collaborate towards a holistic police reform," he said.
__label__world (CNN) A world away from the slick systems of Silicon Valley, war-shattered Libya has seen the birth of a new generation of tech entrepreneurs.

One such is Fatima Nasser. Born in Sabha, a city in southwestern Libya, she was just 13 when the 2011 Arab uprising began and Libya's long-time leader Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown.

Since then, the country has been plagued by political instability, armed conflict and economic challenges. Thousands of people have been displaced, infrastructure and basic social services have been destroyed.

But Nasser insists that the conflict that dominated her teenage years had one positive side-effect.

"It helped me grow in a way that would never happen in normal circumstances," she says. "The war and its consequences on the Libyan economy...did somehow push me into aspiring to be an entrepreneur."

Crisis and opportunity

The now 21-year-old has created a food delivery app called Yummy, that delivers homemade meals cooked by women in their own kitchens. She has trialed the service successfully in hometown Sabha, and says that 300 cooks are ready to start work when the app launches this month in Libya's second-largest city Benghazi, and the capital Tripoli.

Yummy is one product of a nationwide movement to encourage entrepreneurial development and help diversify the Libyan economy away from oil.

In 2017, Tatweer Research, a government-funded company dedicated to creating Libya's knowledge economy, teamed up with MIT Enterprise Forum Pan Arab to launch Libya's first ever Enjazi Startup Competition -- Yummy was one of its three winners.

In the same year, Tatweer Research partnered with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to form the Tatweer Entrepreneurship Campus (TEC), a three-year initiative, funded mostly by the EU, to support startups by providing training, consulting, mentoring, office space and financial aid.

"Each and every crisis is also a bit of opportunity," says Sultan Hajiyev, the UNDP's country director for Libya. "But in a crisis context, people need to be given extra support...this is what we are trying to inject."

Dangerous circumstances

However, there are special problems that come with launching a startup in a war-torn country. New businesses face security threats, poor physical and financial infrastructure and regular internet and power blackouts.

"They need to overcome these challenges in their business model...and build alternative support systems," says Khaled El Mufti, CEO of Tatweer Research.

Yummy will launch in Benghazi this month, a city that still bears the scars of civil war

Nasser says she has listed all of the things that could go wrong while delivering food and a solution for each one.

One major threat is delivering food in unsafe areas with high carjacking rates. To solve this, Yummy has set up neutral meeting points within the city, so that the order can be delivered as close to the customer as possible without endangering the driver.

Another is the dodgy internet, but in case of a blackout Yummy provides a phone number so that the delivery can be handled manually.

El Mufti believes these hurdles can create opportunities and mean less competition. "If everything was running smoothly and nice, then you would get Google, Amazon and everyone in place, doing it their way," he says.

Women in the workforce

Nasser claims the idea for Yummy was driven less by profit and more by the app's potential social impact. In Libya, just one in four women work, according to World Bank -- Nasser is determined for this to change, but she acknowledges the process will be gradual.

"When you come up with a new idea in a society like this, you really have to take into consideration the traditions and the social limitations. We didn't want to come up with an idea that people would be afraid of," she says.

Through Yummy, women are able to work from home, anonymously, without having to interact with male customers. This makes it both liberating and socially acceptable, says Nasser.

She adds that home-catering has become a trend since the war, as security problems have made it more dangerous for women to leave their homes and there is an increased economic need for women to work.

Kunafa, a traditional Arab dessert with Nutella

Ehklas Ekrim, a 26-year-old from Sabha, saw no need to work at all before the war, "but after the economic conditions of the country deteriorated it became necessary to have a special job."

She started working independently as a cook from home, to help provide for her parents and five siblings, but found she was limited to small orders and encountered problems with delivery, dealing with customers and the credibility of orders.

"Yummy fixed all these issues," Ekrim says. "It provided delivery services and worked as a mediator between me and the customers, so now I'm dealing only with Yummy and they're taking care of everything else."

"Life support"

Yummy "has provided life support for a lot of women," says El Mufti, explaining that in the current crisis a regular male income can no longer support a whole household.

But the realization of the economic need has in turn made society more accepting of women working.

As Libya tries to wean itself off oil and gas -- which, according the the UNDP , typically represents 70% of its GDP -- a female workforce is becoming more and more important.

"Addressing the issue of gender empowerment in Libya is not just the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do," says Hajiyev. "It would bridge the gender gap in the labor market, and contribute to advancing Libya's GDP and resolving a number of economic issues and challenges that the country is facing."
__label__world Kollam, India (CNN) As devastating floods hit India's southern state of Kerala, thousands scrambled up to the higher floors in their buildings and crouched together on balconies, waiting desperately for help.

And then, finally, the rescue boats came.

Fishermen, who had loaded their boats onto trucks, voluntarily traveled to Kerala's inner towns and villages, inundated with more than 10 feet of water. Most people gave them a hero's welcome, grateful to be evacuated after a long wait.

But others have hurled insults and abuse at the volunteers.

Marion George, a 47-year-old fisherman, reached a home in the city of Kollam on Friday with a family of 17 trapped inside.

When he told them that he was there to help them, he was asked, "Isn't this a Christian boat?"

Fisherman Marion George says Hindu Brahmin flood victims would only let him rescue them if he did not touch them.

When he replied that, yes, he was a Christian, the men in the family refused to get in his boat and waved him away.

The men were from India's highest Hindu caste , Brahmin, and would not go near George, despite their desperation.

Five hours later, George was back in the same neighborhood and saw the same family calling for his help. He docked his boat close to their home but was again told by the men that they would only board if he did not touch them.

"Normally, their attitude is like this only. We just thought that in this situation, they would have changed," George said.

A volunteer fishermen rests on his nets in an evacuation operation in Kollam, India.

George estimated that he rescued 150 people over two days until his boat was too damaged to continue.

CNN spoke to several other fishermen who also reported being insulted and treated suspiciously by victims they were trying to help.

The Kerala state government has said that more than 2,800 fishermen have been involved in the relief effort.

More than 300 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced, as torrential rains triggered the state's worst flooding in nearly a century, destroying homes and roads. People are clinging to anything that floats to get them out of their homes.

People refuse to leave their homes

There is also an issue of trust in strangers. People have been reluctant to leave their homes and belongings behind out of fear that they will be robbed.

Arun Michael, a fisherman in Kollam, saw the news of the flash floods on TV on Wednesday last week and decided to help. On Thursday morning, he loaded his 32-foot boat onto a truck lent out by the local police and he and three others made their way to the district of Pathanamthitta.

Fisherman Arun Michael with his daughter, Andrea Marie, after he and other rescuers evacuated more than 1,500 people over three days.

Over the next three days, Michael evacuated more than 1,500 people. He navigated his boat through strong currents and rising water levels, reaching flooded homes and helping people climb in. On the last day, he evacuated a total of 600 people.

"What happened now, can happen to anyone. If tomorrow something happens to us, we hope that help would come for us," he said.

But he was surprised to come across victims who greeted him with suspicion and insults.

Some people abused him for trying to convince them to evacuate, he said, referring to a number of victims. Some even made him first carry their dogs to the boat before climbing in themselves.

In some cases, people refused to leave their homes. "They were arrogant and just wanted us to give them food," he said.

But others have been grateful for the bravery and creativity of Michael and his fellow rescuers.

In one instance, Michael and his friends found a house filled with water. They swam out and broke through a door, finding a mentally ill woman in one of the rooms.

The team found three tables and stacked them on top of each other to make a stable base to carry her out, wading through water up to their chins. At times, to stabilize the tables, they had to go underwater, he said.

Arun Michael has not been able to go fishing since his boat was damaged in the evacuations.

The government has announced compensation of 3,000 rupees ($40) to each volunteer fisherman plus the costs to repair damaged boats.

For now, many of the fishermen have been unable to use their boats for fishing, waiting for authorities to deliver the money for quick repairs. But Michael isn't waiting.

"My boat is severely damaged but I won't take anything from the government," he said. "I didn't do it expecting benefits."
__label__world (CNN) "Sang Chol!" 92-year-old Lee Keum-seom exclaimed, as she fell into her long lost son's arms at a holiday resort in North Korea Monday.

Lee had been waiting 68 years for this moment , after the two became separated during the Korean War and became trapped either side of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) which now splits the two Koreas.

Sang Chol was four when she last saw him. He is now 71, himself an old man. On Monday he sat waiting for Lee's arrival with his daughter-in-law. Lee was joined by her two daughters, who grew up in South Korea.

South Korean Lee Keum-seom, 92, meets with her North Korean son Sang Chol, 71, during a family reunion meeting at the Mount Kumgang resort on the North's southeastern coast on August 20, 2018.

Theirs' was one of multiple emotional family reunions taking place at a resort near Mount Kumgang, where buses full of South Koreans drove early Monday.

They were the 89 lucky families selected from the more than 57,000 who had applied for the reunions, agreed to under the Panmunjom Declaration signed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during an historic summit earlier this year.

More than 60% of those seeking reunions are over 80 years old, and are being accompanied on the bus trip north by their children and other relatives.

After the initial tearful reunion was over, Sang Chol showed his mother a photo of her husband, who had been with their son when the couple became separated but has since died.

"This is a photo of my father, mom," Sang Chol said, dissolving into sobs.

Before she left for the bus trip north on Monday, Lee told CNN she had prayed for her son to have a long life so the pair could reunite.

"(My family) in North Korea didn't live long so I prayed for my son's health," she said.

She felt nervous about meeting her now elderly son, after only knowing him as a small child, unsure about where to start catching up on a lifetime spent apart.

"What shall I ask?" she said. "Oh, I should ask him what his father told him about me. His father must have told him about how we got separated and where our house used to be. I should ask him about that."

On seeing him however, there was no hesitation, and the two elderly Koreans embraced each other tightly, both in tears. During the whole reunion, they did not let go of each others' hands.

South Korean participants of the inter-Korean family reunions stand for the national anthem as they undergo a briefing on the eve of the departure for North Korea, at a hotel resort in Sokcho on August 19, 2018.

Long awaited reunions

Lee was one of dozens of South Koreans who gathered Sunday at the Hanwha resort hotel, in Sokcho, south of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) which separates the two Koreas, where medical checks were carried out and participants were warned about nuances of visiting North Korea. They're told to avoid saying anything that could be misconstrued, or considered insensitive north of the border.

Participants were applauded by Red Cross workers as they arrived, some in wheelchairs, passing under banners reading "We sincerely congratulate the reunions of the separated families!"

In the hotel there was an air of excitement and tension as they prepared to meet husbands, wives, brothers, sisters and children who are now only vague memories, their faces blurred by time.

They then registered their names and were invited to take a professional family photo in a corner of the lobby. It was then framed for them so they could then take it to North Korea as a gift.

Park Kyung-seo, president of the South Korean Red Cross, told CNN that while he was overjoyed to be assisting in family reunions, the small number of those taking part was a "human tragedy."

"I share fully with the disappointment of those who are not selected so I am trying with North Korean partners to try and find other solutions, huge numbers are waiting, the numbers are very much limited," he said.

"Imagine 73 years long without knowing whether their family members are still alive or passed away -- no news at all. The agony and anger, that's an unthinkable human tragedy."

In a statement Monday, President Moon urged both Koreas to work towards more reunions in future, noting his own family history as the child of North Korean refugees.

"Expanding and expediting the reunion has the utmost priority out of all the humanitarian projects that both Koreas must conduct. The Koreas must more boldly make an effort towards solving the divided families issue," he said. "As a member of a divided family myself, I sympathize deeply with that sadness and pain. There really is no time"

Ahn Seung-chun was headed to North Korea to see family members she's never met. "I applied to see my older brother," he said. "But he passed so I'll never see him now."

"I'm going to see my nephew and my brother's wife," she added. On one hand, I'm sad that I won't see my brother. But on the other hand, I'm happy to meet the nephew. At least I will be meeting a fruit of my father."

Dozens of elderly and frail South Koreans set off for North Korea on August 20 to meet relatives for the first time since they were separated nearly seven decades ago by a war that divided the peninsula and their families.

Bittersweet process

In the decades since the Korean War, the Red Cross has reunited many families but thousands of others have missed out.

As family members age, each delay adds to fears that they'll no longer be around to finally meet with their long lost relatives. More than 75,000 applicants have already passed away since the reunion process began.

One protester attended Sunday's event to voice his elderly father's case for a reunion, after the man was unlucky this round.

"I don't know when he will die. He is beginning to show signs of dementia. Before he loses everything, he wants to go too," Kim Seong-jin said. "But all he can do is to watch through television each time and get hurt."

Amid all the joy and happy scenes on both sides of the border this week, this is the reality for most whose families remain split by the Korean War.

"My father is all alone here in the South. Can you imagine how much he misses his family?" Kim said. "He wants to hear the news of his hometown before he dies."

Legacy of war

The pain felt by the families split by the Korean War is one of the most visible legacies of the conflict which, 68 years after it began, still hasn't technically ended

An armistice agreement which paused fighting in 1953 never became a formal peace treaty, and small skirmishes have happened since on either side of the heavily fortified DMZ, even as North Korea has built up its nuclear armaments and the US has maintained a heavy military presence in the South.

Officially ending the war was a key element of the Panmunjom Declaration, and both North and South have said they are continuing to work towards that goal, even as negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington appear to have stalled.

North Korean state media called on the US to agree to an official end to the war last week, saying it was a "preliminary and essential process to pave the ground for detente and permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula."

"The U.S. should implement phased and simultaneous measures, like the end-of-war declaration, to build mutual trust and make a breakthrough in the security of the world," state media Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary.

As well as the family reunions, Saturday saw the fulfillment of another commitment made by Moon and Kim, as a joint Korean team marched in the opening ceremony of the Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia.

That move came after a unified Korean team took part in the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea earlier this year, negotiations over which helped kick start a breakthrough in North-South relations and lead to the current detente on the Peninsula.

The incident, which took place in Cornella, just outside the northeastern city of Barcelona in Catalonia, is being treated as a "terror attack," according to regional head of criminal investigations Rafel Comas.

He added that "it was a clear act of aggression against a police officer inside a police station" and "the individual uttered references to Allah" during the incident.

Police are still working to confirm the identity of the attacker.

Comas added that the attacker "was not known to be affiliated with any jihadist cell."
__label__world Beijing (CNN) Taiwan has lost another diplomatic ally to China, its third in a matter of months, after El Salvador announced it would sever ties with the island and switch its allegiance to Beijing.

The governments in Taipei, Beijing and San Salvador all confirmed the development Tuesday, just days after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen visited Central and South America to cement ties with the island's remaining allies.

The loss of the Central American country reduces the number of Taipei's formal diplomatic allies to just 17. Both Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic cut ties with Taiwan in May.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his Salvadoran counterpart in Beijing on Tuesday morning and signed a joint communique to establish formal diplomatic relations.

__label__world Rome (CNN) Pope Francis will meet privately with victims of clerical sexual abuse during his visit to Ireland this weekend, the Vatican said on Tuesday.

It isalso "very possible" the Pope will publicly address the abuse topic during his visit, the Vatican's press office director, Greg Burke, said during a media briefing.

Burke added that the pontiff would pray at St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral In Dublin on Saturday, where a candle has burned for years in remembrance of the country's victims of sexual abuse.

In 2009, Ireland was rocked by a report commissioned by the Irish government that found high-ranking church leaders covered up clerical child abuse spanning decades.

While it is not unusual for the pontiff to meet privately with victims of abuse during an overseas visit, it is unusual for the Vatican to announce such plans in advance.

__label__world Moscow (CNN) August is an anxious month for Russia watchers. Whether it was the 1991 coup against Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the 1998 financial crisis or the 2008 war with Georgia, August often seems to bring some unexpected confrontation or near-catastrophe.

So how will Russia surprise us this August?

Certainly, the cycle of its confrontation with the West seems to be accelerating again. Alarm bells rang in Washington on Tuesday, when Microsoft announced that a hacking operation linked to Russian military intelligence and targeting the US Senate and conservative think tanks had been foiled.

Microsoft said it had executed a court order, giving it control of six websites created by a group known as Fancy Bear -- the same group cybersecurity firms say was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee that disrupted the 2016 US presidential elections.

The Kremlin on Tuesday denied any knowledge of attempts to interfere in US elections, after Microsoft announced the hacking attempt. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call that allegations of hacking were not grounded in fact, and that the Russian government had no knowledge of the attempted interference.

"We don't know which hackers they are talking about; we don't know what is meant about the impact on elections," he said.

News of the attempted hacking comes amid fresh saber rattling by the Russian armed forces. On Monday, Russia's Defense Ministry announced it would stage its largest war games since the fall of the Soviet Union next month.

The exercises, dubbed Vostok 2018, will involve thousands of troops in a major test of military readiness.

Troops from China and Mongolia will also take part. Gen. Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, said the military maneuvers would be on an "unprecedented scale," rivaling the Soviet-era Zapad-81 maneuvers that involved as many as 150,000 troops, according to CIA documents.

The time certainly is ripe for further confrontation between Moscow and the West. On Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is expected to deliver a speech in Washington that will call on the European Union to keep a united front on sanctions against Russia.

JUST WATCHED Mystery surrounds deaths of journalists Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mystery surrounds deaths of journalists 03:29

According to excerpts of the speech obtained by CNN , Hunt will argue that Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy "has made the world a more dangerous place."

Hunt's speech comes as the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations prepares to hold a hearing on US-Russia ties.

Russia remains under US sanctions, with little prospect of them softening.

And fraught US-Russian relations will be the focus later this week when White House National Security Adviser John Bolton meets his Russian counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev, to follow up on the recent Helsinki summit between Putin and President Donald Trump. In an interview with ABC before his trip overseas, Bolton said the US would discuss Russian meddling and concerns about efforts to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections.

So are we entering a dangerous new phase of confrontation? Not exactly.

One wonders, for instance, if there isn't a bit of hyperbole in the way the Russians have billed the upcoming military exercises.

Last year's Zapad 2017 war games, which took place on Russia's western frontier with the NATO alliance, prompted intense speculation that they might in fact be a prelude to war, or that the deployments would be a smokescreen for some permanent Russian military presence in neighboring Belarus.

Those fears didn't materialize, though anxieties still run high over Russia's military posture in the Baltic region. And Russia continues to back separatists in eastern Ukraine, where a military conflict continues to simmer following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

And the upcoming Vostok war games, it seems, are not just meant as a show of force to the US and other potential adversaries. According to Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, the maneuvers signal a profound shift in Russia-China relations.

"[The] Vostok drills are aimed at countering foreign invasions and addressing military threats for Siberia and the Far East," he wrote in a commentary on Twitter. "China was among potential adversaries for many years. Now Moscow's message is that it doesn't view Beijing as an adversary anymore."

That's not to say the war games aren't significant: As Gabuev noted, the games underscore the export of sophisticated Russian military hardware, such as the S-400 air defense system and the Su-35 fighter that will boost China's military power in regional hotspots.

That doesn't diminish concerns in Washington, however, about Russia's intent to interfere with US elections. The kind of hack seen in the attempt flagged by Microsoft -- a tactic known as spear phishing -- was successfully used to target Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta in 2016.

In a blog post, Microsoft President Brad Smith expressed concern that democratic governance systems remain under threat.

"Despite last week's steps, we are concerned by the continued activity targeting these and other sites and directed toward elected officials, politicians, political groups and think tanks across the political spectrum in the United States," he wrote.

"Taken together, this pattern mirrors the type of activity we saw prior to the 2016 election in the United States and the 2017 election in France."

And that means the pattern of accusations against Russia — and the pattern of Russian denial — is set to continue.
__label__politics (CNN) The Trump administration is moving forward with more tariffs on Chinese goods this week while officials from both countries negotiate on trade in Washington.

It's the second round of tariffs imposed by the two countries this year. A total of $50 billion of goods on each side will be taxed as of Thursday.

The Trump Administration started the process in March, aiming to punish China for what it says are unfair trade practices, such as stealing intellectual property. Beijing has responded with retaliatory tariffs.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is planning to spend at least 40 days on the road campaigning for Republicans before the midterm elections in November, the President's top White House political advisers said on Tuesday.

"We identified and held 40 -- at least 40 -- days of travel from August 1 to Election Day," counselor to the President Johnny DeStefano, who oversees the White House's political operations, told reporters on Tuesday.

DeStefano said the midterm campaign travel they are planning for Trump would put him on the road more than his last two predecessors spent campaigning during that time period. President George W. Bush spent 33 days on the campaign trail during the two midterm elections of his presidency, while President Barack Obama spent 22 days and 36 days during the midterm elections, DeStefano said.

Over the next six weeks, DeStefano and White House political director Bill Stepien said Trump is scheduled to travel to six different states -- North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Kentucky and Tennessee. They cautioned the states could change as events are often not locked in until two weeks ahead of time, to give Trump more flexibility on where he can best deploy himself.

Trump was busy flexing his midterm muscles in West Virginia on Tuesday, where he invited the Republicans Senate nominee Patrick Morrisey to join him on stage and warned his supporters of the consequence of a "blue wave" in November.

__label__politics (CNN) In an interview with Reuters on Monday , President Donald Trump tried to explain why he is wary of sitting down with special counsel Robert Mueller to answer questions about Russia's interference in the 2016 election and the possibility of collusion between his campaign and the Russians.

Here's what he said:

"So if I say something and he [former FBI director James Comey] says something, and it's my word against his, and he's best friends with Mueller, so Mueller might say: 'Well, I believe Comey,' and even if I'm telling the truth, that makes me a liar. That's no good."

This is, to be clear, how the President views a "perjury trap" -- a move that his lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has long insisted is the main reason why the President shouldn't even consider sitting down with Mueller.

But what Trump is describing above isn't a perjury trap at all.

Let's define the term first: A perjury trap is when a prosecutor asks questions of a witness knowing that witness will lie. In order to lure someone into a perjury trap, you have to know two things beyond any doubt: 1) The facts behind the question and 2) That the person you are asking the question of is going to lie about the facts.

It's not at all clear that's what would be going on with a Mueller-Trump sit-down -- on matters related to Comey or anything else. And in fact, the scenario Trump lays out isn't even close to a perjury trap. Instead it's a "he said, he said" with a bit of conspiracy theory thrown in. It's a lot of things all at once, sort of like the Triple Lindy

Trump is saying that his version of events on certain things might well differ from, say, what Comey's version of those events are. That's similar to the argument that Giuliani made during an appearance on "Meet the Press" on Sunday:

"I am not going to be rushed into having him testify so that he gets trapped into perjury. And when you tell me that, you know, he should testify because he's going to tell the truth and he shouldn't worry, well that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth. Not the truth."

The problem here is that Giuliani (and Trump), whether intentionally or unintentionally, are conflating a "he said, she said" debate with a perjury trap. What they are describing are two people having different recollections of an event. That happens all the time in legal proceedings. Citing it as a perjury trap is a red herring to change the conversation about why Trump might not want to sit down with Mueller.

Then there is the conspiracy theory angle. In Trump's mind, he could somehow be brought up on perjury charges solely because Mueller would choose to side with Comey's version of events rather than his because Comey and Mueller are friends. Which is, um, a pretty big logical leap.

To believe what Trump told Reuters, you have to think that Robert Mueller, a man who has served four presidents -- of both parties -- and who spent a decade as the head of the FBI would be willing to risk his credibility by siding with someone he is friends with rather than the President of the United States. And, by the way, that the entire special counsel team would just go along with it -- thereby risking their own careers and credibility.

Which is, um, not likely.

There is also the issue of whether Comey and Mueller are as close as Trump, Giuliani and the conservative media like to paint them. There's little question that the two have, in the past, had a very close working relationship. They began working together in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and were unified in opposition to Vice President Dick Cheney's attempt to force a re-upping of a broad-scale surveillance measure in 2004. (For much more on that, read this terrific Washingtonian profile of the two men by Garrett Graff.)

Comey's lawyer, David Kelley, told Snopes this

"Jim and Bob are friends in the sense that co-workers are friends. They don't really have a personal relationship. Jim has never been to Bob's house and Bob has never been to Jim's house. ... They've had lunch together once, dinner together twice, once with their spouses and once after Jim became FBI director so Bob could give him a run-down on what to look out for. [Bob] is not a mentor. He's friendly, as colleagues are."

In truth, however, how close -- or not -- Mueller and Comey are is irrelevant per the point above. Do reasonable people really believe that Mueller would risk his career to take sides with a friend (or work buddy) over the president? No.

All of this is to say: None of what Trump (or Giuliani) is alleging is a perjury trap. Not even close.
__label__politics (CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a series of new planks Tuesday in her wider plan to stem corporate influence on government and root out corruption in Washington.

Introduced as a potential 2020 presidential primary contender, the Massachusetts Democrat took aim at President Donald Trump, casting him as the product of a rotten system rather than an outlier or fluke and saying his administration fit a decades-old pattern of self-dealing in Washington.

Warren's plan, which would impose a lifetime ban on appointed officials from taking lobbying jobs, is dead on arrival in a Republican-controlled Congress. But it is likely to influence the talking points of other Democrats and, should she run for higher office in 2020, be a staple of her campaign pitch.

In a speech at the National Press Club, Warren called for Congress to "end lobbying as we know it" and not allow "the rich and powerful buy their way into congressional offices."

"Our national crisis of faith in government boils down to this simple fact: People don't trust their government to do the right thing because they think government works for the rich, the powerful and the well-connected and not for the American people," Warren said. "And here's the kicker: They're right."

__label__politics (CNN) Lanny Davis, the attorney representing President Donald Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen, said Tuesday his client has information on Trump that would interest special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation.

"I do believe that he has information about Mr. Trump that would be of interest both in Washington as well as New York state," Davis told Chris Cuomo on CNN's "Cuomo Prime Time."

Cohen pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday to eight criminal counts and admitted he acted to keep information that would have been harmful to Trump's campaign from becoming public during the 2016 presidential election. The charges bring an end to a months-long investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

Cohen was a fixer for Trump and his family during his time working for the President, and was often fiercely loyal during interviews. Cohen once said he "would take a bullet" for Trump and was proud of his reputation as the Trump clan's pit bull.

Davis teased potential revelations regarding the Trump Foundation, the President's charity that has come under scrutiny from state investigators after a series of press reports during the 2016 election.

__label__politics (CNN) Parts of an operation linked to Russian military intelligence targeting the US Senate and conservative think tanks that advocated for tougher policies against Russia were thwarted last week, Microsoft announced early Tuesday.

The disclosure, coming less than three months ahead of the 2018 midterms, demonstrates new ways in which Russia is attempting to destabilize US institutions. The news also places additional pressure on President Donald Trump to take action, even though he downplayed Russia's involvement as recently as Monday.

In its announcement, Microsoft said it executed a court order giving it control of six websites created by a group known as Fancy Bear. The group was behind the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee and directed by the GRU, the Russian military intelligence unit, according to cybersecurity firms.

The websites could have been used to launch cyberattacks on candidates and other political groups ahead of November's elections, the company said.

Microsoft said the domains were "associated with the Russian government and known as Strontium, or alternatively Fancy Bear or APT28." The company said it has no evidence that the domains were used in successful attacks but that it was working with the potential target organizations.

Microsoft argued in court that the domains were posing as some of its company's services.

"Attackers want their attacks to look as realistic as possible and they therefore create websites and URLs that look like sites their targeted victims would expect to receive email from or visit," Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a blog posted to the company's website on Monday night.

Although the websites could be used to trick members of the Senate and think tanks, they also could have been used to dupe other people or entities that interact with them.

Think tanks have criticized Russia

JUST WATCHED Microsoft stops Kremlin-based hackers Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Microsoft stops Kremlin-based hackers 01:24

Hackers could have used the domains to send emails to Senate staffers or people working for the Hudson Institute or the International Republican Institute in an attempt to trick them into handing over information, like their passwords.

This form of attack, known as spearphishing, was successfully used to target Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta in 2016. Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill's staff was similarly targeted by a Russian group last year. McCaskill has said the attempt was unsuccessful , and Microsoft took control of the domain that targeted her staff via a court order in Virginia earlier this year.

Among the websites for which a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia granted Microsoft control were those with domain names designed to resemble sites used by congressional staff. They include "senate.group" and "adfs-senate.email."

Other domains were designed to look like they were related to the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, and the International Republican Institute , whose board includes six serving senators, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Gen. H.R. McMaster.

Both think tanks have been critical of Russia.

The Hudson Institute runs the Kleptocracy Initiative, which has an advisory council with several Russia experts and focuses on revealing how "financial secrecy fuels globalized corruption and threats to democracy" and frequently scrutinizes on the Kremlin.

The International Republican Institute has been working to promote democracy since the 1980s and receives funding through the US State Department, US Agency for International Development and the National Endowment for Democracy. IRI has also been critical of Russia, and the Russian Federation labeled the group an "undesirable organization" in 2016.

The institute's board of directors includes several Republicans in Congress. Arizona Sen. John McCain led the board earlier this year and Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan took over for McCain. Both have been critical of Trump.

"This apparent spearphishing attempt against the International Republican Institute and other organizations is consistent with the campaign of meddling that the Kremlin has waged against organizations that support democracy and human rights," Daniel Twining, IRI's president, said in a statement Tuesday morning. "It is clearly designed to sow confusion, conflict and fear among those who criticize (Russian President Vladimir Putin's) authoritarian regime."

Kremlin denies involvement

The Kremlin on Tuesday denied any knowledge of attempts to interfere in US elections.

"Our reaction has already become traditional: we don't know which hackers they are talking about, we don't know what is meant about the impact on elections," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to a CNN question. "From the US, we hear that there was not any meddling in the elections. Whom exactly they are talking about, what is the proof, and on what grounds are they reaching such conclusions?"

He added, "We don't understand, and there is no information, so we treat such allegations accordingly."

In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Trump -- who has openly and repeatedly questioned US intelligence findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election with the goal of harming Hillary Clinton's campaign to aid his bid -- blamed special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the matter for undermining his efforts to improve relations with Moscow.

Mueller's investigation has "played right into the Russians -- if it was Russia -- they played right into the Russians' hands," the President said.

But the President's own Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, delivered a speech at the Hudson Institute last month, in which he called Russia "the most aggressive foreign actor" participating in efforts to undermine American democracy.

Also last month, the Justice Department announced indictments against 12 members of the GRU, as part of Mueller's investigation, for allegedly disseminating information it had stolen from the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2016.

The indictment laid bare how two units of the GRU had been allegedly responsible for the intrusions, putting names to a group that had only been known under monikers like Fancy Bear and APT28.

Recent attacks

The news comes less than a week after it emerged that two Democratic congressional primary candidates were hacked earlier this year.

The campaigns of Dr. Hans Keirstead and David Min, both of whom lost in California's June primaries, were breached, but the groups responsible for the attacks have not been made public and may not be known.

Microsoft said Monday that, in light of the ongoing threats to political groups in the US, it was launching a specialized cybersecurity protection service called AccountGuard.

The company says it will offer the service to all candidates and campaign officials, as well as think tanks and political organizations that use Microsoft Office 365, at no additional cost.

The initiative is part of Microsoft's Defending Democracy Program, which it launched in April. The company said it plans to roll out AccountGuard in other parts of the world.

This story has been updated with additional context about the Russians' attempted interference.
__label__world (CNN) A video of a man making racist comments while on a beach has prompted widespread outrage and sparked a conversation about racism in South Africa.

In video apparently taken on a beach in an unknown place, the man who was named in South African news reports and on social media as Adam Catzavelos, uses a derogatory term for black people widely known in South Africa as the K-word.

The video has caused widespread outrage since a Twitter user posted it on the platform on Tuesday.

The hashtag #AdamCatzavelos has since been trending as people used Twitter to condemn his comments, with some sharing his personal and work details as well as those of his wife, Kelly Catzavelos, who South African media says works as a merchandising director for sportswear firm Nike in South Africa.

__label__world (CNN) After waiting decades to reunite with family members cut off by war, busloads of mostly elderly South Koreans returned home Wednesday leaving behind their relatives in the North.

The tearful celebrations seen on Monday when the mostly-elderly participants in the Red Cross-organized reunions saw each other for the first time in decades, were eclipsed by the heartache of the goodbyes, after just a dozen hours across three days at a resort in North Korea.

South Korean participants could be seen sobbing as they waved to their family members before they departed. As the coaches pulled away, some North Koreans ran after them, as others wiped at tears or pounded on the walls in frustration at the limited time together.

North Koreans wave farewell to their South Korean relatives (in the bus) after a three-day family reunion event at North Korea's Mount Kumgang resort on August 22, 2018.

As they crossed the the demilitarized zone (DMZ) which separates the two countries, the 89 families from South Korea returned to the strict controls on communication with the North and almost complete isolation from their loved ones there.

In this they share with the 57,000 others who were eligible to take part in the most recent round of reunions but missed out, some for the twentieth time.

__label__world (CNN) The Australian government is in chaos amid a desperate attempt by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to resist a leadership push from his ruling Liberal Party's right-wing faction, led by former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton.

Dutton announced early Thursday he would challenge Turnbull for the second time in a week, following the resignation of more than a dozen ministers across the government.

But the Australian leader fought back against the conservative uprising at a hastily called news conference in Canberra Thursday, accusing a minority of destabilizing the government in an attempt to seize power.

"Australians will be rightly appalled by what they're witnessing in their nation's parliament today and in the course of this week," Turnbull said, describing the campaign against him as "a form of madness."

Staring down the challengers, Turnbull said he would only hold a leadership vote if he was given a petition with signatures from the majority of his party room. If it arrives, the meeting would be held at midday Friday.
__label__politics (CNN) On Wednesday afternoon, Fox News released a snippet of its interview with President Donald Trump. (The interview is set to run in its entirety on Thursday morning). Here's the exchange between Fox's Ainsley Earhardt and Trump on whether he knew about payments arranged by his one-time lawyer Michael Cohen to women alleging affairs with Trump in the run-up to the 2016 election:

Earhardt: "Did you know about the payments?"

Trump: "Later on I knew. Later on. But you have to understand, Ainsley, what he did -- and they weren't taken out of campaign finance, that's the big thing. That's a much bigger thing. Did they come out of the campaign? They didn't come out of the campaign, they came from me. And I tweeted about it. You know, I put -- I don't know if you know but I tweeted about the payments. But they didn't come out of campaign. In fact, my first question when I heard about it was did they come out of the campaign because that could be a little dicey. And they didn't come out of the campaign and that's big. But they weren't -- that's not a -- it's not even a campaign violation. If you look at President Obama, he had a massive campaign violation but he had a different attorney general and they viewed it a lot differently."

There's so much wrong here. Let's go through it point by point.

1. Trump says he knew about the payments -- $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels, $150,000 from American Media Inc. to ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal -- "later on." That runs directly counter to what Trump said in April when asked about the Cohen payment to Daniels. Here's that exchange:
__label__politics (CNN) A string of damaging legal developments rattled Republicans on Tuesday and further heightened the stakes of the 2018 midterm elections less than three months away.

The startling, coast-to-coast rat-a-tat-tat -- a conviction in Virginia, a confession in New York and new charges in California -- left the GOP off balance and had Democrats, already eyeing a sharper anti-corruption message for the fall, arguing voters should put them in power in Congress to serve as a check on President Donald Trump.

If Democrats take over the House in November -- and with it, the committee chairmanships and the subpoena power that comes with the gavels -- Trump would suddenly be open to a whole new, harsher brand of scrutiny, with investigations sure to dog the administration straight through to the 2020 election.

Tuesday's news also put front and center a thornier issue for Democrats ahead of November and one Republicans believe could energize Trump's base: impeachment.

Party leaders and parts of the liberal base have often found themselves at odds over the prospect of seeking to remove the President, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has frequently sought to tamp down such talk, telling the Associated Press on Wednesday that impeachment is still "not on the table."

Democratic campaign aides in states won by Trump in 2016 reached by CNN said they had no plans to alter their strategies -- and that the party should be wary of reacting too quickly to fast-moving developments.

"There's a lag time for the average person, the person who is somewhat politically aware but is more worried about paying bills or health care premiums," one aide to a campaign in a red state told CNN. "Maybe there will be new data and the polling says, 'Wow, the worm has finally turned, he's done it, it's finally happened, he's gone too far, how dare he?' -- but I think we're still a little away from having any actionable data (that says that)."

Although a number of Democrats already have seized on impeachment -- namely mega-donor Tom Steyer, who has led a public campaign calling for Trump's ouster, and California Rep. Maxine Waters, who has drawn Trump's ire for doing the same -- most Democrats have avoided taking the issue on head on, and Pelosi has said repeatedly that impeachment is not a priority for the party.

One senior Republican official working on the midterms, even while charting how to overcome the growing corruption cloud, said the hope inside the party was Democrats would overplay their hand and the conversation would most overtly "shift toward impeachment."

"Take the bait Democrats," the official pleaded.

The more likely tactic is an increasingly sharp focus on the alleged corruption and ethics scandals that have surrounded the Trump administration for more than a year.

Tuesday's damaging double-dose of legal news for the President, with his former personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen pleading guilty to eight criminal counts and implicating Trump in his court statement, made the political case clearer. Shortly before Cohen's confession in New York, Paul Manafort, the man who led Trump's presidential campaign for five months, was found guilty of eight financial crimes in Alexandria, Virginia.

The hits didn't stop there.

Moments later, news broke that California GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter and his wife were indicted on charges related to the misuse of $250,000 worth of campaign funds for personal expenses and the filing of false campaign finance records. Hunter is the second Republican House member to be indicted this month after New York Rep. Chris Collins, who was charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and false statements stemming from an alleged insider trading scheme. Hunter and Collins were the first two House members to endorse Trump's presidential bid in 2016.

Taken together, the news played right into the anti-corruption messaging already being deployed by Democrats in the run-up to the 2018 midterms.

"Today's guilty verdicts against Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort & guilty plea by Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, are further evidence of the rampant #CultureOfCorruption & criminality at the heart of Trump's inner circle," Pelosi, D-California, tweeted on Tuesday.

It wouldn't be a totally novel approach for the party as it seeks to reclaim power in a midterm year.

Democrats used the same term -- "culture of corruption" -- in 2006 when they won 31 seats in the House and five in the Senate to take control by hammering Republicans over a mess of scandals surrounding California Rep. Duke Cunningham, who confessed to accepting bribes; the fallout from the lobbying scandal engulfing Jack Abramoff; and the resignation of Florida Rep. Mark Foley in September of that year after he was caught sending sexually explicit messages to House pages.

In a sign of messaging to come, Aftab Pureval, a Democrat hoping to flip Ohio's first congressional district in November, slammed Republican Rep. Steve Chabot for being part of the problem and then turned the indictment on Trump.

"We need to actually drain the swamp," he said. "We have to hold people accountable and I'm glad the courts did that today. But the best way we can do that is to elect new leaders in November."

Longtime Democrats see evidence that a similar strategy could work again this fall.

"People were already uneasy about continuing Trump's Congress of yes men," said Jesse Ferguson, a longtime Democratic operative, "but now they're going to demand checks and balances to end the cover-ups."

The revelations could steepen what is already expected to be an uphill climb for Republicans, especially with independent voters, and further threaten the majorities they've used to effectively shield the White House from more aggressive oversight.

But their messaging strategy, like the President's, has remained constant: dismiss Cohen as a liar; cast Manafort's conviction as unrelated to the Russia probe; and stress -- over and again -- that there was "no collusion" between Trump and Moscow ahead of the 2016 election.

Meanwhile, Democratic candidates and operatives said that while Tuesday's events sharpened that corruption line of attack, the fundamentals remained that the 2018 fight will likely remain focused on issues like tax policy and health care.

"Every day, the dark cloud hanging over the Republican Party grows more ominous," said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committees spokeswoman Meredith Kelly. "House Republicans must answer for the Trump Administration's scandals -- and often their own ethical issues, while Democrats continue to focus on lowering the cost of healthcare, increasing wages and bringing upstanding, ethical leadership to Washington."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani have talked about the potential political repercussions of pardoning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, The New York Times reported Wednesday.

Giuliani told the Times that pardoning Manafort, who on Tuesday was found guilty on eight of 18 financial crimes, was not something the President was considering.

However, the paper reported that Giuliani said in an interview that Trump thought Manafort had not been treated well.

"Yesterday's plea and Manafort's conviction, none of it had to do with collusion, none of it has to do with obstruction," Giuliani said, according to The New York Times. "He really thinks Manafort has been horribly treated."

__label__politics Mueller has actually made progress

Trump's argument that Mueller's probe hasn't found anything relating to Russia ignores the many indictments of Russians accused of trying to interfere in the US election. And it ignores the guilty pleas from a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who has admitted to lying to authorities and trying to set up meetings with Russians.

It ignores the infamous Trump Tower meeting between a Russian woman who was offering compromising information on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Mueller, by the way, is still very actively conducting his probe. More direct allegations of collusion with Russia could be on their way.

The law allows special counsels to uncover crimes as well as investigate them

But Trump's larger point is that Mueller's probe has evolved from its original purpose.

True, it was launched to find "any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump." But Mueller was specifically deputized to pursue "any matters that arose or may arise directly from that investigation." If you don't think Cohen's allegation that Trump orchestrated the payoffs of Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal rises to that level, there's more. The code by which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller goes further and says the special counsel has more jurisdiction:

"If in the course of his or her investigation the Special Counsel concludes that additional jurisdiction beyond that specified in his or her original jurisdiction is necessary in order to fully investigate and resolve the matters assigned, or to investigate new matters that come to light in the course of his or her investigation, he or she shall consult with the Attorney General, who will determine whether to include the additional matters within the Special Counsel's jurisdiction or assign them elsewhere."

It was under a different law, but this is the same principle by which a special counsel appointed during the Clinton administration started out investigating a land deal and ended up encouraging impeachment because of President Bill Clinton's statements under oath about his sexual relationship with a White House intern

This is a good place to point out that Cohen's guilty plea was engineered by the US Attorney in the Southern District of New York and not by Mueller's special counsel's office.

Mueller referred the case to the Southern District months ago, before a raid on Cohen's apartment.

Cohen's and Manafort's crimes are serious

But the biggest problem with Trump's "no collusion" defense is that he's trying to minimize the guilt of his former associates. It's not related to Russia, so it shouldn't have been prosecuted, essentially. But they were crimes, at least in the minds of Manafort's Alexandria, Virginia, jurors, who agreed on eight of 18 counts and could send the former Trump campaign chief away for the rest of his life. Along with guilty pleadings from former Trump campaign staffers George Papadopoulos and Rick Gates and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who are all cooperating with Mueller, the universe of Trump associates with the word "guilty" next to their names continues to grow.

That's a problem for those staffers and a serious problem for Trump, whose promise to hire only the best people seems questionable at best.

The hard reality of all those proven or admitted crimes, however, makes it very difficult for Trump to do anything but attack the credibility of the system. At some point he can no longer try to marginalize all the now-convicted criminals who worked for him. There are too many.

That's why he'll continue to claim it's all a big witch hunt, even though that claim is getting very hard to defend. He was praising Manafort on Tuesday, for instance, as a strong and honorable man who didn't "break" like Cohen.

"I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. 'Justice' took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to 'break' - make up stories in order to get a 'deal.' Such respect for a brave man!" Trump said

"Brave man" is a very interesting way to spin convicted tax fraud.

In the case of Cohen, the White House and Trump have argued the campaign finance charges he copped to shouldn't even be crimes.

"Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!" Trump said Wednesday on Twitter
__label__world (CNN) If you've been watching the political shenanigans in Australia's capital with growing incredulity, spare a thought for the Australian voter: the person Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Thursday should be at the center of every politician's focus, and not an afterthought.

If you haven't been watching, a quick recap: a right wing faction within Turnbull's Liberal Party, which governs the country as part of a coalition government with the National Party, tried to seize power earlier this week.

The leadership contest, known as a "spill," came after Turnbull backtracked on an energy bill he wanted to push through parliament but didn't because it would have failed to garner enough support even from within his own party's ranks.

Turnbull who won the initial leadership contest 48 votes to 35, told the media of his satisfaction over the outcome, and averred that the government would carry on with its primary job, governing.

That was Tuesday.

By Wednesday night, all pretense of solidarity his challengers -- chief among them now former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton -- had shown with Turnbull in the preceding hours was abandoned.

Thursday, the contest was back on.

Parliament shut down five hours early as Liberal politicians huddled to count votes and collect numbers. Turnbull emerged later to tell reporters that he'll hold a party vote on Friday if his opponents presented a letter with enough signatures to support his ousting.

"The public hate what is going on at the moment. They want everyone here to be focused on them," Turnbull said later. "I have done everything I can to keep the Liberal Party and indeed the Coalition united."

But as he ponders what are likely his final hours as Australia's latest prime minister, he couldn't resist throwing a grenade or two at his party colleagues before shutting the door firmly behind him.

'Classic, back-to-the-wall' Malcolm

If Turnbull is going to end his almost three years as Australia's premier on Friday, he's made it clear he won't make it easy for Dutton and those who back the Queensland conservative.

For starters, there's the possibility that Dutton, an immigration hardliner, might be in breach of the constitution over his financial interests in childcare centers that received millions of dollars in government subsidies.

The country's solicitor-general was investigating and will provide advice on Friday that could determine whether Dutton, tipped to be the country's new leader by the end of the week, is even eligible to keep his seat in parliament because of the conflict of interest.

"I cannot underline too much how important it is that anyone who seeks to be Prime Minister of Australia is eligible to be a member of Parliament because a minister, let alone a Prime Minister, who is not eligible to sit in the House is not capable of validly being a minister or exercising any of the powers of a minister," Turnbull said Thursday.

"This is classic, back-to-the-wall Malcolm Turnbull. Looking for legal loopholes, looking for delaying tactics, and never giving in," wrote Annabel Crabb , a political writer for Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Additionally, he has dangled the prospect that the ruling coalition, which governs by a single seat majority in the lower house of parliament, would lose that tiny advantage should the no-confidence vote move ahead on Friday.

"If the motion is carried, I will treat that as a vote of no confidence and I will not stand as a candidate in the ballot," Turnbull said.

"I made it very clear that I believe former prime ministers are best out of the parliament and I don't think there's much evidence to suggest that that conclusion is correct. It's not correct."

That remark was a subtle jab at the man he ousted from the leadership in 2015. Tony Abbott remained in parliament after that putsch, and has been one of the main protagonists in the bid to oust Turnbull.

Crisis of their own making

The greatest irony for the federal politicians, who critics argue base policy decisions on popularity polls, is that should Dutton assume the premiership on Friday, he's not likely to keep the job beyond the next election.

The current opposition leader is the Labor Party's Bill Shorten. Shorten got 27% in that latest poll.

There's even the possibility that Dutton may not be able to hold onto his own electoral seat . He holds the Queensland state seat of Dickson by a mere 1.6%.

"The conservatives within the Liberal party have put their unpopularity down to their lack of a conservative identity, while liberals within the same party consider the conservatives as unelectable," said Rodger Shanahan, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute.

"This appeared at first blush as a conservative move to re-establish the Liberal Party's conservative credentials," he told CNN. "But the longer it goes on, there's a feeling that this is less about ideology and more about more prosaic issues like revenge and personal ambition."

Australia's former home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, faces the media at a press conference in Canberra on August 21, 2018.

Ugly questions around race

Former prime minister Julia Gillard, who took part in her own share of leadership contests when she was in parliament, told an audience in Melbourne Thursday that she feared the country was headed into an election "that would be quite ugly around questions of race."

"There's been no secret that there will be campaigning on law and order questions, putting to the forefront people's race and ethnicity rather than the crime," she said.

Dutton's unpopularity stems in large part from his hardline stance on immigration tests and social issues, including his opposition to same-sex marriage before its legalization in 2017. He also boycotted the national apology to the generations of Aboriginal children forcibly removed from their parents and families and made to assimilate into white Australian culture.

But he has been bolstered by conservatives in the national dialogue, both in politics and in the media , something Turnbull also spoke to during his remarks on Thursday.

"You have got to judge the political actions by their outcomes. I think what we're witnessing -- what we have witnessed at the moment is a very deliberate effort to pull the Liberal Party further to the right." Turnbull said.

"What began as a minority has by a process of intimidation, you know, persuaded people that the only way to stop the insurgency is to give in to it. I do not believe in that. I have never done that. I have never given in to bullies, but you can imagine the pressure it's put people under."
__label__world (CNN) An Egyptian former diplomat was detained by authorities in Cairo on Thursday, just two weeks after calling for a referendum on President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's government, family members told CNN.

"Security forces took my father, Maasoum Marzouk, from our home without explanation and without cause just for practicing his constitutional rights of calling for a referendum," Maisara Marzouk said.

"A minibus of around 15 civilian-dressed, armed security personnel arrived at 1pm and arrested him, then searched his house and took his personal belongings without showing us the legal permit for that procedure," she added.

Maasoum Marzouk was detained by Egyptian authorities on Thursday.

Khaled Ali, Marzouk's lawyer, confirmed the detainment, adding that seven opposition leaders also were arrested in the sweep.

Marzouk is a former ambassador and assistant minister of foreign affairs. He is renowned for his criticism of the Sisi government. He recently founded The People's Democratic Party, an opposition party.

__label__politics (CNN) The Trump administration's latest round of tariffs on Chinese goods kicked in Thursday, drawing immediate retaliation from Beijing.

The new exchange of fire in the trade war between the two economic superpowers comes as officials from both countries hold talks in Washington over the dispute

The United States imposed 25% tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods just after midnight ET Thursday -- midday in Beijing. The tax affects 279 Chinese products , including chemical products, motorcycles, speedometers and antennas.

China responded immediately with 25% tariffs on an equal amount of American goods , such as chemical products and diesel fuel.

The Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement that China "has to continue to make necessary counterattacks." It added that it plans to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization.

Both China and the United States have now imposed tariffs on $50 billion of each other's goods in the clash, which the Trump administration launched in an effort to punish China for what it says are unfair trade practices, such as stealing intellectual property. The first round of tariffs went into effect in July

And more are in the pipeline.

The United States has threatened to slap 25% tariffs on an additional $200 billion of goods . China has said it would respond with tariffs on another $60 billion of American goods in retaliation. It's harder for China to match this latest threat dollar-for-dollar because the United States exports far less to China.

Chinese and US officials are meeting in Washington this week for a new round of trade talks. Previous negotiations failed to produce any lasting deals, and President Donald Trump has suggested the current talks may not be much different.

Trump said in an interview with Reuters this week that he did not "anticipate much" from the discussions, which involve lower level officials than in previous rounds. Resolving the dispute will "take time because China's done too well for too long, and they've become spoiled," he said.

Plenty of American companies are worried. Many have warned the latest measures would hurt their business, and they would not be able to absorb 25% tariffs without raising prices on American consumers.

Representatives from the motorcycle industry, electric bicycle makers, food equipment manufacturers, and chemical companies have written to the government or testified in opposition to this latest round of tariffs.

The CEO of Purolite, a company that imports chemicals used to purify water testified before the US Trade Representative's Office. He warned that tariffs on those chemicals could reduce an already short supply.

"By further reducing the supply of these products in the United States, the proposed tariffs threaten higher prices for US consumers and a higher level of contaminants in American drinking water, food chain, waste water, and chemicals," said CEO Stefan Brodie at a hearing last month.

But other companies said they wanted items added to the list. The president of Southwire -- an electrical wire, cable and cord manufacturer -- said tariffs on certain cables would allow the company to remain profitable.

"The Chinese government has engaged in a series of policies designed to promote exports of these products and enable Chinese producers to capture significant global market share," the executive, Charlie Murrah, said at the hearing.

Businesses in China are also feeling the effects of the trade war, which has weighed on the country's financial markets. Investors are becoming increasingly concerned about how a slowing Chinese economy will weather a protracted dispute with the United States.

The country's huge export industry has already started to cool, according to recent data.

Such fears have helped push China's main stock index i nto a bear market and drive the country's currency, the yuan, sharply lower against the US dollar.

__label__politics (CNN) Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Thursday that President Donald Trump could replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions after the midterm elections in November.

Graham's comments make him one of the first Republicans on the Senate committee to signal an openness to Trump ousting Sessions in his first term.

In an interview with reporters Wednesday, the senator from South Carolina said ultimately it was up to Trump to decide who he wanted for the job and that while he personally likes Sessions, he said Trump deserved an attorney general he had "faith in."

"The President's entitled to having an attorney general he has faith in, somebody that is qualified for the job and I think there will come a time sooner rather than later where it will be time to have a new face and a fresh voice at the Department of Justice. Clearly, Attorney General Sessions doesn't have the confidence of the President," Graham said.

Graham added specifically, "That's an important office in the country and after the election, I think there will be some serious discussions about a new Attorney General."

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump, amid the worst week of his presidency, sat down for a friendly interview with "Fox and Friends" host Ainsley Earhardt to make his case. As so often happens when Trump is backed into a corner, he lashed out at, well, everyone.

I went through the transcript of the interview Fox released this morning. Trump's quotes -- and my thoughts on them -- are below.

1. "And I guess you could say that our numbers in winning whether it's for the Senate, or for Congress, or for governor has been very good."

And away we go! To be clear: Every traditional predictor of election outcomes suggest Republicans will take a battering in the House and at the governors level. The Senate, because the playing field is heavily tilted toward Republicans, could be more favorable to Trump's side.

2. "I've always had controversy in my life and I've always succeeded. I've always won. I've always won."

Two notes here: a) he's right -- his entire life has been controversial and b) he only sees things through the lens of winning or losing. There is no other measure of success or failure. If you win, you were right.

3. "They like to cover nonsense."

Trump is talking about the media here, insisting the press doesn't cover the good economic news of his administration. ( Not true !) Earhardt's response to that attack on the media -- of which she is, theoretically, a part? "Right." Good times.

4. "Well I don't know if he was a fixer. I don't know where that term came from."

Well, Michael Cohen, at the direction of Trump, set up a shell company and negotiated payoffs to two women -- Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal -- who alleged they had affairs with Trump. And remember that the way Cohen and Trump met was Cohen took Trump's side in a dispute with tenants in one of his buildings. You could say Cohen has " fixed " more than one problem for Trump.

5. "But he was somebody that was probably with me for about 10 years and I would see him sometimes."

This is a dramatic underplaying of Cohen's closeness to Trump over that decade, according to what we know about the two men's relationship. Anytime Trump had a problem that needed fixing -- and that happened fairly frequently -- he turned to Cohen to fix it. Cohen was involved therefore in some of the most delicate situations in Trump's world -- including paying hush money to women making allegations about affairs.

6. "He made the deal. He made the deals."

This is Trump's response to Earhardt asking him whether he directed Cohen to make the payments to Daniels and McDougal. Which, of course, isn't a denial at all. The issue is not who "made the deals," but who directed the deals to be made.

7. "Those two counts aren't even a crime. They weren't campaign finance."

What Trump doesn't know about campaign finance law is, um, a whole lot. He seems to believe that because he didn't give money to Cohen from the 2016 campaign account that it was totally fine to dole out tens of thousands of dollars to silence women making allegations about a candidate for president. Which it isn't. What Trump did is effectively make a campaign loan to Cohen to handle a problem for him. He never disclosed that loan. And we know for a fact that Cohen has testified that Trump "directed" and "coordinated" him to make the payments for the express purpose of influencing the election.

8. "Later on I knew. Later on."

Trump's "later on" response about when he found out about the payments that Cohen made to Daniels and McDougal simply doesn't jibe with what he has said in the past. In April, on Air Force One, Trump had this exchange with a reporter:

Reporter: "Did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?"

Trump: "No."

Reporter: "Then why did Michael Cohen make [the payment], if there was no truth to her allegations?"

Trump: "You'll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael's my attorney, and you'll have to ask Michael."

Reporter: "Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?"

Trump: "No I don't know.

So......

What's remarkable is Earhardt's follow-up to this clear lie by the President of the United States is "Why is Cohen doing this?" Really knocking it out of the park.

9. "If you look at President Obama, he had a massive campaign violation but he had a different attorney general and they viewed it a lot differently."

Apples and oranges. Or, more accurately, apples and kumquats. Like, not even in the same universe.

It is true that Obama's campaign was fined a hefty $375,000 by the FEC in 2013 for failure to file 48-hour contribution reports -- donations made within the final weeks of a campaign -- that totaled $1.3 million. The oversight was discovered in an audit of the Obama campaign.

Compare that fine to what is alleged here: A candidate for president directed the end-run of campaign finance laws in hopes of suppressing allegations made by women about romantic dalliances. He did so, according to Cohen, with the express purpose of influencing the election.

Yes, so, no.

10. "But what Michael Cohen pled to weren't even campaign related. They weren't crimes."

Again, Trump simply doesn't understand -- or is choosing not to understand -- campaign finance laws. Simply because the money he paid to Cohen wasn't from the campaign's coffers doesn't mean it wasn't a crime. Cohen literally pleaded guilty to two campaign finance crimes on Tuesday. Like, does Trump not think the Southern District of New York is aware of what the laws surrounding campaign finance are? [Narrator voice: They are.]

11. "And they put the two counts of campaign violations in there but a lot of lawyers on television and also lawyers that I have say, they're -- they're not even crimes."

Name one. Seriously.

12. "For 30, 40 years I've been watching flippers. Everything's wonderful and then they get 10 years in jail and they -- they flip on whoever the next highest one is, or as high as you can go."

"According to a 1981 FBI memo , Trump offered to 'fully cooperate' with the bureau, proposing that FBI agents work undercover in a casino he was considering opening in Atlantic City. FBI agents even prepared an 'undercover proposal concerning the TRUMP casino' that senior agents and Trump planned to discuss, according to the document."

13. "It -- it almost ought to be outlawed. It's not fair."

14. "You know, campaign violations are considered not a big deal, frankly."

Let me say again: Donald Trump is not terribly well-versed in campaign finance laws.

15. "But if somebody defrauded a bank and he's going to get 10 years in jail or 20 years in jail but if you can say something bad about Donald Trump and you'll go down to two years or three years, which is the deal he made."

There's a big difference between Cohen (or anyone) getting a reduced sentence because they are willing to "say something bad about Donald Trump" and what Cohen did: Agreed to plead guilty to eight felony counts and testify -- under oath -- that Trump directed and coordinated an end-run of campaign finance laws. This is not Michael Cohen calling Donald Trump names and getting time cut off his prison sentence. This is Michael Cohen saying the President of the United States was complicit in a crime.

16. "I've had many friends involved in this stuff. It's called flipping and it almost ought to be illegal."

17. "I'll tell you than somebody made a better deal. Awan, the IT guy for Shultz. Congresswoman Shultz. He had all the information on Democrats. He had all the information on everybody. He went to jail holding the hands of the Justice Department and the FBI."

Trump is referring here to Imran Awan, a former staffer for Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former head of the Democratic National Committee. He pleaded guilty last month to filing a false statement on a bank loan application . Trump -- and other conspiracy-minded folks on the right -- have seized on the fact that Awan worked with Wasserman Schultz as evidence he was involved in the hack of DNC emails during the 2016 campaign. You know, the one the intelligence community has concluded was Russia's doing.

In the plea deal with Awan, the government said that there was zero evidence that Awan stole information from DNC servers or tried to abscond with the servers themselves.

18. "I mean, he was worse than anybody in my opinion. He got nothing. He's a Democrat. He got nothing."

Awan was sentenced to time served earlier this week. That amounted to one day in jail and 11 months of monitoring with an ankle bracelet. At Awan's sentencing hearing, the district judge said this -- clearly referencing Trump: "There have been numerous allegations, ... accusations lobbed at him from the highest branches of the government, all of which have been proved to be without foundation by the FBI and the Department of Justice."

19. "I put in an attorney general that never took control of the Justice Department. Jeff Sessions never took control of the Justice Department and it's a sort of an incredible thing."

Trump belittles his hand-picked attorney general, chapter 5,291

20. "Comey's his best friend."

This has become one of Trump's favorite talking points when trying to discredit the special counsel probe being run by former FBI director Robert Mueller. It's not at all clear it's true. There's no question Mueller and Comey know one another through work. There's a lot of questions about the actual closeness of their relationship

21. "He had a really nasty business transaction with me, which he never reported. I've been talking about it, he never reports it."

The "really nasty business transaction" Trump refers to here is what The New York Times reported that Trump has claimed was a dispute over fees at one of his golf clubs when the former FBI director resigned his membership in 2011. According to The Washington Post , "a spokesman for Mueller said there was no dispute when Mueller, who was FBI director at the time, left the club."

22. "I have great respect for what he's done in terms of what he's going through."

This is Trump's response to an Earhardt question on whether he is considering pardoning former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Trump's response is a little bit different -- OK, a LOT bit different -- from how White House Secretary Sarah Sanders answered the Manafort pardon question on Wednesday afternoon. "Once again, that is not something that has been up for discussion," Sanders said. Um, what?

23. "He wasn't with the campaign long."

Manafort was Trump's de facto campaign manager from April 2016 until August 2016. That period was of critical import to Trump as he went from the frontrunner for the nomination to securing it. It was also the period of time -- June 2016 to be exact -- that we know Manafort as well as Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner met with Russians to talk about the alleged dirt they claimed to have on Hillary Clinton.

24. "They surveilled my campaign, it's very simple."

The FBI surveilled Carter Page, a foreign policy aide to Trump, because they believed him to be possibility under the influence of the Russians . The surveillance warrant was approved by the FISA court and re-approved three times. This wasn't some rogue operation conducted by the so-called "deep state" within the FBI.

25. "When everybody see's what going on in the Justice Department I always put justice now with quotes. It's a very, very sad day. Jeff Sessions recused himself, which he shouldn't have done. Or he should have told me."

This is Trump's response to Earhardt asking whether he was going to fire Sessions. It doesn't exactly read like a vote of confidence.

26. "Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you wouldn't have put him in."

[Narrator voice: They don't.]

27. "You know the only reason I gave him the job. Because I felt loyalty, he was an original supporter. He was on the campaign."

A remarkable admission here from Trump -- albeit unintentional. The "only reason" he appointed Jeff Sessions to be the nation's highest ranking law enforcement official was because Sessions was loyal to him on the campaign. Only the best people!

28. "The immigration laws are horrible. We're doing an incredible job."

Back to back sentences. Unedited. No rhyme, reason or connection I can decipher.

29. "You know when you have bad laws you can do good. But you can do a lot better if you had good laws."

[scratches out a series of complex math equations on a yellow-lined notebook] Yeah, this checks out.

30. "I don't know how you can impeach somebody who's done a great job."

This is the most astounding quote in the entire Trump interview. If you are doing a self-assessed "great job" then it is impossible for you to have broken any laws? That's literally what Trump is saying here.

31. "I tell you what, if I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, I think everybody would be very poor."

Remarkable. The self-regard on display here is truly staggering. The only thing that has made the economy strengthen is Trump, according to Trump. Without him? Good luck, America.

32. "The New York Times cannot write a good story about me. They're crazed. They're like lunatics."

Let's be clear here. Trump views "true" news as news that is good for him. "Fake news" is then news that is bad for him. For all of his talk about "fake news" he is totally uninterested in the accuracy of reporting. He is entirely fixated on whether a story reads positively or negatively for him.

33. "And I'll never forget, you talk about the fake news, they said Donald Trump met [Kim Jong Un] the first day it was incredible, nobody could believe I was able to do it."

So, wait. The news is fake. But Trump cites favorably in this section the fact that the news reported on the historic summit he engineered with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. But if the news is fake, then how... [head explodes]

34. "So I give myself an A-plus."

Earhardt asked Trump what grade he would give himself. That Trump went with the highest possible grade really tells you everything you need to know about him. Seriously.

35. "The only thing ... I'm doing badly on is the press doesn't cover me fairly."

If I had to name my greatest weakness, I think I would probably say it's that I care too much about people. Or maybe that I am so smart it makes it hard to interact with people not as smart as me. Either one would work.

36. "I would say I would honestly give myself an A-plus and so would many other people."

__label__politics (CNN) From suggestions for members of a science committee to emails sent "on the sly" and thoughts for the secretary's speeches, new internal emails from the US Department of Agriculture show big food industry lobbyists are working hand-in-glove with agency staffers.

The newly released emails were obtained by the nonpartisan independent Project on Government Oversight via a Freedom of Information Act request and shared exclusively with CNN. Though exposing no apparent legal violation, they offer a window into how some top USDA political appointees -- former lobbyists themselves -- are in frequent contact with their old employers and others who are lobbying the agency, and how those lobbyists are seeking to influence the agency on issues large and small.

The USDA, under the Trump administration, has moved to roll back a series of regulations opposed by industry, to the chagrin of health and food safety advocates. The emails show how the agency is very willing to work with industry lobbyists, even accepting and using talking points for one of Secretary Sonny Perdue's speeches.

Perdue speech

In January, a representative from the lobbying group National Grocers Association sent a USDA official talking points for a speech the secretary would give to the group the next month.

"We're thrilled that Secretary Perdue will be speaking at the NGA Show in a couple of weeks. In advance of his speech during our opening general session on Sunday February 11 I wanted to share a few themes that may be appropriate for him to mention given the audience that will be in the room," wrote Greg Ferrara, executive vice president of public affairs for the association.

The email was sent to USDA policy adviser and former industry lobbyist Kailee Tkacz. She responds, "Thank you for sending this along, will get to our comms team and keep you posted. Good stuff!"

Four days later, Perdue's speechwriter emailed Ferrara at the National Grocers Association, "Greg, I am working on remarks for Secretary Perdue for the NGA show. I would like to talk with you for a few minutes about the event. Kailee forwarded your e-mail with suggested themes. Is there a good time to give you a call and what is best number? Thank you for your help."

Among the talking points offered by Ferrara is a discussion of how rural grocers "are often the only food store for miles in rural America, committed to sticking it out, not because they are getting rich, but because they live in these communities and know without a grocery store the community will suffer. They are not driven by Wall Street, but rather by Main Street and are an essential part of what makes American great."

In his February speech to the association, Perdue echoes the talking points, telling the grocers that "your stores many times are the only stores available for food for miles around, and we don't acknowledge that very often, but I ... appreciate you sticking it out. I appreciate you sticking it out not because you are certainly getting rich in doing that, I understand that you're not ... there for the money, you're living there because you know it is supportive to the community ... you're not driven by Wall Street, certainly, you're driven by Main Street, and you are making a difference there where you serve."

USDA Communications Director Tim Murtaugh told CNN by phone that "in that case, the speechwriter liked the phrasing and the rhetoric there and just elected to use it." Asked whether that's a normal practice for the agency's speechwriter, Murtaugh added, "What's the big deal? It's just the description of the role of small grocer stores."

In a written statement Murtaugh added that "it is a common practice among speechwriters the world over to gather information from the organizers of events, including specific topics of interest, to be incorporated into prepared remarks. In one passage highlighted by CNN, the speech merely employed complimentary language that the National Grocers Association uses to describe its own members."

The National Grocers Association told CNN that providing these types of talking points is "normal practice," it does this "as a courtesy for most speakers who address our organization" and said "how a speaker uses the background information ... is entirely up to their discretion."

But Republican speechwriter Landon Parvin, who has written for Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, discussed the email and the speech with CNN and said the practice is not normal.

"I wouldn't say it's normal," Parvin said. "I would worry about the optics. The optics aren't good."

Parvin explained that groups traditionally do discuss topics of interest with the speechwriter, but he says sentences in a Cabinet secretary's speech should not closely mirror those found in lobbyists' talking points. "You don't want to get the speaker in a situation where it looks like they are quoting a lobbyist."

Roughly 10 minutes of Perdue's 23-minute speech paralleled the lobbyist talking points. Perdue paraphrased most -- but not all -- of the themes the lobby group laid out in its talking points.

The speech also included portions that did not come from the talking points about the administration's agenda.

Ethics groups say the agency should be deciding what the secretary says in his speeches -- not industry.

"The federal government should be creating the talking points for a Cabinet head, not a trade association. This makes it look like the agenda is being set by lobbyists," said Norm Eisen, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. "President Trump ran on draining the swamp, but government agencies are continuing to pursue the special interest agenda. This is a profound betrayal of Trump's drain-the-swamp promise."

Sodium and potassium committee

Another email exchange shows USDA officials and industry representatives discussing the names of people whom industry would like to see serving on a committee looking into the health effects of consuming sodium and potassium. The emails show industry's behind-the-scenes efforts to influence the outcome of a critical study, and the USDA appearing receptive to the industry's influence.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has formed a 14-person committee to study how much salt and potassium is safe for Americans to eat. The study is known as the review of the Dietary Reference Intakes for sodium and potassium. The USDA is one of six sponsors for the committee and its study.

Emails from late January show that USDA official and former industry lobbyist Tkacz, other top USDA appointees and a team from Food Directions, which has lobbied for the National Restaurant Association and Grocery Manufacturers Association, got together for an in-person meeting. Following that meeting, the group's senior director of food policy writes to USDA'S Tkacz, "As promised, attached to this email is the list of potential names and bios, all of whom, we feel, would bring more balanced perspectives to the DRI committee in order to ensure robust debate of all of the science. This updated list includes the two additional names I mentioned in the meeting."

The industry has complained there aren't enough industry voices on these sorts of advisory panels. The email suggests the lobbyist is seeking USDA support for particular industry-friendly candidates for the committee.

Marion Nestle, visiting professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell, says she's not surprised by the email communications: "We have a very industry-friendly government right now."

Nestle says sodium is a controversial topic in the food industry: "Salt is in junk food. It's in restaurant food. The industry has a vested interest in having salt in the food supply." But their interests may be at odds with public health interests. Nestle says for that reason "it's important to keep industry out of scientific advisory committees about diet, because industry has a vested interest."

The National Academy of Sciences said in an email, "Suggestions can come from any interested party, so it is possible for sponsors to submit recommendations," but would not say specifically whether USDA had done so, noting that "details regarding committee nominations received are kept confidential."

CNN asked whether the USDA recommended any of the 14 individuals currently studying the issue. USDA Communications Director Murtaugh told CNN, "No one from the list was recommended for the committee by USDA, and none of them was named to the committee."

The 14 people currently serving on the committee all appear to be either scientists or academics.

The National Academy of Sciences says on its website that "a committee is not finally approved until a thorough balance and conflict-of-interest discussion is held at the first meeting and any issues raised in that discussion or by the public are investigated and addressed."

CNN reached out to Tkacz. The USDA responded on her behalf, saying the agency "did nothing" with the industry-provided list.

But Nick Schwellenbach, director of investigations at the Project on Government Oversight, finds the email from Food Directions troubling.

"It's still an industry attempt to influence the committee's makeup and the scientific advice it would ultimately provide. But the attempt likely happened too late after the die had been cast and membership was decided," he said.

The snack industry

On January 9, Tkacz, a former director at SNAC International, the international trade association of the snack industry, wrote an email marked "high" importance to Jessica Hixson, a lobbyist with SNAC, Tkacz's former employer. "I have a random question for you," the email starts. Tkacz explains that Perdue might be traveling near Snyder's and Utz facilities in the coming weeks in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Snyder's of Hanover is a snack food distribution company and Utz is, according to its website, the largest independent, privately owned snack brand in the United States.

Tkacz wrote, "I am trying to put in the plug in he should pop by one or both of these facilities for a tour. I don't want to get everyone excited at the companies yet in case it doesn't happen, but I am curious if you could on the sly get me data on their export numbers so I can make the case for the Secretary to visit?"

Later in January, Perdue headed to central Pennsylvania to promote the farm bill. He made a stop in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, which is a short distance from Hanover, but the agency says he did not end up visiting Snyder's or Utz.

Karen Perry Stillerman, with the Union of Concerned Scientists, says the email illustrates a USDA employee working behind the scenes with her former employer in what looks like a "blatant intervention on behalf of companies Tkacz once lobbied for."

Ethics experts point to a law that says government employees are required to "act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual."

The agency's communications director defended the emails: "When planning the Secretary's trips to states, it is common for USDA staff to contact agriculture-related businesses in order to consider them as locations to visit."

Ed Schafer served as USDA secretary under President George W. Bush. While he doesn't believe the email communications between the two were an ethical violation because he doesn't see a potential visit providing economic gain for the companies, Schafer told CNN, "I would prefer if my trips were not arranged involving lobbyists. I'd prefer my staff to consult with and arrange trips through local USDA offices and state agriculture departments."

Schafer said relying on state and local governments over lobbyists is the preferred way to operate because lobbyists have narrow agendas.

The USDA, again responding on behalf of Tkacz, said she "was familiar" with the Snyder's and Utz locations because she came to USDA "with knowledge she learned while working elsewhere" and that she is complying with ethics rules, so "there is no conflict of interest."

__label__world Beijing (CNN) One of China's former highest-ranking Buddhist monks sexually harassed nuns, China's top religious regulator said Thursday, just weeks after he strongly denied the accusations against him.

In a statement posted online, the National Religious Affairs Administration (NRAA) said its investigation found Shi Xuecheng had sent sexually explicit messages to multiple women.

In a 95-page document submitted to Chinese authorities in July, two monks at Beijing's Longquan Temple accused the 51-year-old of sexually harassing and assaulting multiple nuns, leaving at least one victim suicidal

Following the investigation, the NRAA ordered the Buddhist Association of China to severely punish Xuecheng, who stepped down as head of the religious body last week.

Investigators also discovered numerous irregularities in the running of Beijing's Longquan Temple, where Xuecheng was the long-time abbot, including illegal constructions and missing funds.

The NRAA statement added allegations Xuecheng committed sexual assault have been reported to the police, who are now investigating.

Explosive allegations

Xuecheng, who has taken a vow of celibacy like most Buddhist monks, released a brief statement denying all allegations when the scandal first emerged in early August. He has not commented on the latest developments.

The explosive report compiled by the two monks contained numerous examples of explicit messages Xuecheng allegedly sent to at least six nuns. In the messages, the sender demands total obedience from the women, including sexual favors, as part of their study of Buddhist doctrines.

It also included accounts from a number of the alleged victims, some of whom said they were so devastated by their experiences they became mentally unstable.

According to the document, which circulated widely online before being censored, one victim eventually reported the matter to Beijing police in June, alleging Xuecheng had sexually assaulted her and several other nuns.

Shi Xianqi, one of the two monks behind the original document, which also includes allegations of corruption, told CNN earlier this month that he and co-author Shi Xianjia stood by their words and were cooperating with the authorities. It is customary for Buddhist monks in China to adopt the family name Shi.

In a statement to CNN at the time, Xianqi described how he began investigating the abbot earlier this year when a "fearful and nervous" nun told him about the explicit messages she had been receiving.

"So many faithful Buddhist women wanted to join the temple and I always voted yes," he said. "Little did I know I was sending them to the tiger's mouth."

"The abbot's learned image has crumbled in my mind," he added. "All that's left is huge fear. He is evil in the Buddha's robe."

High-profile religious leader

China boasts more than 240 million Buddhists despite the ruling Communist Party being officially atheist.

Shi Xuecheng was considered one of the most high-profile religious leaders in the country, penning numerous books and traveling around the world to promote Chinese Buddhism.

He had been known to put a modern twist on the ancient religion, maintaining an active online presence and teaching Buddhist ideas through cartoons. In 2016, he attracted brief worldwide attention when his temple launched a humanoid "robot monk" designed to greet young visitors.

His temple has also been viewed as an intellectual bastion with highly educated young monks. Both of the whistleblowers hold doctorate degrees in engineering from one of China's most prestigious universities.

The scandal comes at a time when women in China are pushing back hard against widespread sexual abuse , in a manner similar to the #MeToo movement in Western countries.

Xuecheng is not the first prominent Chinese Buddhist monk facing serious allegations in recent years. In 2015, Abbot Shi Yongxin of Shaolin Temple, the country's legendary kung fu monastery, was accused of being an embezzler and womanizer with illegitimate children.
__label__world (CNN) The last time a Pope came to Ireland was 1979, and Colm O'Gorman remembers tuning into live television coverage of the visit from his family's home in County Wexford.

The teenager watched with rapt attention as Pope John Paul II celebrated a "youth Mass" in the harbor city of Galway like a rock star, declaring in his homily to a festival-like crowd of hundreds of thousands: "Young people of Ireland, I love you."

A year and a half later O'Gorman was raped for the first time by a Catholic priest.

"When I look back at that visit and see now how it has been remembered, I think about myself at age 13. I was going to Catholic school, I was an altar boy, the youth group I went to took place in a convent. Everything I did, my whole life, the Church was at the center of it," O'Gorman said.

"And I think about how Pope John Paul II said he loved me -- well, he didn't."

This weekend will be a moment of reckoning for survivors in Ireland and across the world, as Pope Francis arrives for the first papal visit to the country in nearly four decades amid an intensifying outcry over Church-related abuse scandals.

Executive director of Amnesty International Ireland Colm O'Gorman, who is a clerical abuse survivor, has organized a demonstration during Pope Francis' visit to Dublin.

On Sunday, as the Pope delivers a Mass to the faithful in Dublin's Phoenix Park, across town, at the Garden of Remembrance, O'Gorman -- who is now the executive director of Amnesty International Ireland -- will join thousands to protest clerical sexual abuse.

The Pope's trip coincides with the World Meeting of Families, a gathering of the Catholic Church that was thrown into chaos last week by a Pennsylvania grand jury report detailing decades of sexual abuses by priests and cover-ups by bishops.

Two American cardinals have had to drop out of the meeting as a result of the report, including Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the former Bishop of Pittsburgh and a key papal ally. Weurl, who was accused of helping to cover up abusive behavior, was to deliver the keynote address on "the welfare of the family." In the wake of the report, the bishop said he "did everything that I possibly could" to stop abuse from happening.

Pope Francis speaks with Cardinal Donald Wuerl during his visit to the US in September 2015.

In response to rising anger over the revelations, the Pope issued a letter on Monday acknowledging the church's failure to act over abuse, but the apology has been criticized by victims -- as well as Irish clergy members -- for not going far enough.

And after the Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, sparked outrage earlier this month when he indicated that time would be "very tight" for the Pope to meet with abuse survivors on his two-day visit, the Vatican broke with tradition on Tuesday by confirming that private meetings would indeed take place

O'Gorman, who sued the Church and won after being sexually abused by a priest between 1981 and 1983, said the Vatican's announcement had created a "soap opera" in Ireland, with members of the media repeatedly calling survivors to ask whether they had been granted an audience with the pontiff.

"I am disgusted with Pope Francis, and utterly repulsed with how the Vatican has conducted itself," O'Gorman said, adding that if the Pope cared about victims, he would be dragging documents relating to clerical abuse into St. Peter's Square in Rome for the world to see.

As the Catholic Church continues to be rocked by sex abuse scandals spanning the globe -- most recently in the US, Chile and Australia -- pressure is mounting for the Vatican to release records from its secret archives.

A demonstrator holds a placard reading "Devils Disguised as Priests" during a protest against the sexual abuse scandal in Santiago, Chile.

On Monday, BishopAccountability.org, a US-based nonprofit that tracks allegations of abuse against Catholic clergy, published for the first time the names of more than 80 Catholic clerics in Ireland and Northern Ireland it says were convicted of child abuse.

"There are so many names that are unknown in Ireland, so many priests accused, that are under the radar," Terry McKiernan, founder of BishopAccountability.org, told CNN, adding that the organization hopes the database will encourage the Church to come forward with the names of all priests disciplined over abuse.

Mark Vincent Healy, who was sexually abused by two priests, helped BishopAccountability.org compile the list. In 2014, he became the first male survivor of Irish clerical sex abuse to meet with Pope Francis, but he says the Church hasn't done enough in the intervening years.

"We're still fighting the same statute of limitations, we're still trying to get services for survivors, we're still trying to stem the self-harm and suicide rates, we're still trying to open closed records. It's too slow," Healy told CNN.

Urgent calls for action, and exasperation over the same "cut-and-paste" apologies, are being echoed by survivors across Ireland.

Marie Collins, who was assaulted by a priest at the age of 13, resigned last year from a special Vatican commission created by Pope Francis to tackle child abuse, saying that senior clerics in the Church refused to implement their suggested safety policies.

"What I would like to see when the Pope comes to Ireland, is to come out, not make these sort of 'we're sorry' type of statements, but to tell us what is he going to do -- and do it," Collins told CNN. "And it must be something concrete."

But there is less consensus about what those concrete steps might be.

Since the first reports of abusive priests were released in Ireland in 2005, a torrent of revelations detailing abuse and mistreatment in Catholic-run institutions -- from orphanages, to industrial schools, workhouses known as Magdalene Laundries and so-called mother-and-baby-homes -- have followed.

While Ireland has pledged €1.5 billion to victims through a financial redress program, abuse survivor Michael O'Brien said that compensation wasn't enough -- calling on Pope Francis to do more.

"He must talk to us and tell us what he's going to do about the rape of children that's been done by priests of the Catholic Church today," said O'Brien, a former politician who rose to prominence a decade ago after revealing on Irish television that he was abused in a Catholic school as a child.

"We're fed up with all this. We want closure. We want it to stop," he told CNN.

"I don't see anything at the end of the tunnel. Until I hear something else from the Pope, I won't believe it."

__label__world (CNN) A US-owned local radio station has been shut down for insulting women in Rwanda, authorities say.

The Amazing Grace Christian Radio , a radio station that airs religious sermons, had its broadcasting license revoked after one of its presenters, Nicolas Niyibikora, repeatedly referred to women as evil, Rwanda officials said.

The Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA) announced it had taken away the station's license on Tuesday.

#RURA has revoked the broadcasting license of Amazing Grace Christian Radio after this station failed to comply with #RURA 's sanctions taken after a sermon aired by the radio on January 29, 2018 in which a radio presenter repeatedly insulted women referring to them as evil #RwOT pic.twitter.com/NjggGmMnsc

"The revocation follows failure by Amazing Grace Christian Radio to comply with RURA's sanctions taken after a sermon aired by the Radio on 29 January 2018 in which a radio presenter Nicolas Niyibikora repeatedly insulted women referring to them as evil," the statement read.

'The bible protects women'

The radio station's founder, an American evangelist Gregg Schoof , has filed a lawsuit to get the radio back on air.

The court case will be heard Thursday in Rwanda's capital, Kigali.

Schoof responded to news of the license removal with a statement saying he had done nothing wrong.

He added that he was ordered to plead guilty against his conscience and that Pastor Niyibikora has not been found guilty yet.

"I am not Pastor Nicholas. Pastor Nicholas must apologize for himself," Schoof said.

"Pastor Nicholas was not found guilty yet. There has been no testimony, no hearing, and no court case for his message. So RURA wants me to apologize for someone who is still presumed to be innocent?"

Schoof has distanced himself from the "evil" comments and stated that he does not support the use of such language on women.

"I am against any kind of language that is against women," he said to the Rwandan Media Commission (RMC) ethics committee, The East African reported. "The bible protects and promotes women's rights. But I have not got the entire translation of the sermon since it was in Kinyarwanda."

Controversy

Immediately after the show's original airing in January, complaints followed on social media.

Women's rights groups, the National Women's Association and Rwanda Women Journalists' Association, filed complaints to Rwanda Media Commission the media regulatory body in Rwanda, The East African reported

In February, RURA imposed sanctions on the station, including a one month suspension, a $2,300 fine and an apology to the public.

When the station failed to comply with the sanctions, RURA said it had no choice but to withdraw the station's license.

Rwanda is seen as making positive strides towards gender equality. It has the highest percentage of women in its parliament in the world.

Free speech

The move also comes amid the closure of over 700 churches in Rwanda by local authorities, Rwandan newspaper The New Times reported.

The country is seen as making significant progress since the genocide in 1994, but there are media restrictions and self-censorship, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).

Political opponents and journalists remain largely vulnerable, with reports of disappearances, according to Amnesty International.

Rwanda currently ranks 156 out of 180 in the World Press Freedom Index.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The lawyer representing Stormy Daniels, the porn star suing President Donald Trump, claimed Friday that she has faced physical threats.

"My client was physically threatened to stay silent about what she knew about Donald Trump," Michael Avenatti told CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day." He said more details would be forthcoming in Daniels' upcoming interview on CBS's "60 Minutes," which is scheduled to air later this month.

"She's going to be able to provide very specific details about what happened here," Avenatti said.

He would not answer whether or not it was someone close to the President who threatened her, and later told CNN he wouldn't answer a question about whether he or Daniels filed a police report.

CNN has reached out to Larry Rosen, a lawyer representing Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney, and Jill Martin, a Trump Organization lawyer who has been involved in legal matters related to the Daniels allegations.

__label__world Hong Kong (CNN) A near constant wind buffets the top deck of Boat 36826 as it patrols the seas north of Hong Kong's largest island, Lantau.

Sitting in a white plastic lawn chair, staring intently through a pair of large, black binoculars, Charlotte Lau pulls a multicolored scarf high over her face and zips up her grey hoodie.

Down a steep staircase in the boat's main cabin, her boss Taison Chang sorts through the supplies piled on seats and a wide, curved table -- maps and charts, a GPS tracker, snacks, waterproofs, two-expensive cameras with long lenses, and several bottles of suncream in defiance of the dreary skies overhead.

Next to Lau, holding a walkie-talkie and shivering in a blue t-shirt, Viena Mak writes on a clipboard as her co-worker says: "no sighting."

It's a phrase the trio are becoming depressingly used to. They work for the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society (HKDCS), which sends researchers out almost every day, no matter the weather, to search the city's waters for an ever-shrinking population of dolphins.

Their relentless work matters, not just to keep a few individual animals alive, but as a test of whether Hong Kongers can have more of a say in how their city progresses, take a step back from the mega projects and uninhibited development that have characterized Hong Kong for decades, and act to preserve what made it special in the first place.

Charlotte Lau and Viena Mak from the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society survey the waters near Lantau Island.

I. Ancient 'ruddy' residents

On a day in July 1637, British explorer and trader Peter Mundy sat at anchor aboard the ship "Planter," near what was then still the Portuguese colony of Macau.

It was one of the first recorded mentions of the Chinese white dolphin, but would go largely unnoticed until another European, Swedish missionary and naturalist Pehr Osbeck wrote of "snow-white dolphins (which) tumbled about the ship" and suggested a scientific name for them: "delphinus chinensis."

European explorers Peter Mundy and Pehr Osbeck were among the first to record sitings of the Chinese white dolphin.

Now officially the Sousa chinensis (to reflect their relation to the wider Sousa, or humpback dolphin, genus), the animals are more commonly known as pink dolphins due to their pink bubblegum-like coloring in adulthood.

Growing up to 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) in length, with short, stubby snouts and small dorsal fins high up on their arched backs, pink dolphins have lived in the waters around Hong Kong for hundreds of years, as the human population grew from the low thousands in the 1600s to the millions today.

Throughout that time, pink dolphins -- and to a lesser degree the finless porpoise, another local cetacean -- were a common sight for Hong Kong fishermen, who regarded the animals as a catch-stealing nuisance at best, and an evil omen at worst.

Pink dolphins have lived in Hong Kong's waters for centuries.

Seeing pink dolphins leap out of the water was said to be a harbinger of storms; one old story has it that in 1941, fishermen off Yau Ma Tei saw a particularly large pod cresting three days before the Japanese Air Force began bombing the city.

While some saw dolphins as having an effect on human affairs, no one took much mind of what people might be doing to the dolphins until the 1990s, when scientists began sounding the alarm that population numbers were plummeting.

Today, there are an estimated 10,000 pink dolphins globally, with the largest population, around 1,200, in the Pearl River Delta region. HKDCS estimates 47 dolphins currently make the city's waters their home.

II. Breathing room

Hong Kong is dense. The city squeezes 7.4 million people into an area three times smaller than Rhode Island, with 57,250 people per square kilometer in the busiest neighborhoods.

For hundreds of years , the solution to this density has to be to carve out a bit more space by filling in parts of the sea. Industrial land reclamation began in earnest in the late nineteenth century, as the city's British rulers attempted to expand their new possession by dredging out bays and advancing shorelines.

At its most basic level, land reclamation is the process of scooping rock and other materials from a hillside and dumping them into the sea until the resulting pile is high enough to be built upon. However, this method results in "large displacement of the marine sediments and the development of mud-waves beneath the reclamation fill," according to a 1996 government review

Such underwater disruption can destroy habitats and release toxic materials trapped under the mud into the surrounding water -- potentially decimating fish and other local marine populations.

In order to address these concerns, attempts have been made to minimize the environmental impact by using vertical wick drains like giant straws to suck moisture out of the mud, making it solid enough to be built upon, but even the most minimal reclamation work is a major engineering undertaking creating extra marine traffic and huge amounts of noise and disorder underwater.

Despite these precautions, Samantha Lee, manager of oceans conservation at the World Wildlife Fund's Hong Kong office, warned that because dolphin numbers are already diminished -- and they face a multitude of other challenges -- they are particularly vulnerable to continued construction work.

"The government has been adopting a 'develop first, conserve later' approach," she said.

III: Reclaimed waters

A constant stream of planes passes overhead, deafening the crew of Boat 36826 as they near a line of white buoys strung out over the water north of Hong Kong International Airport. Inside the perimeter sits a cluster of barges with red-and-white towers reminiscent of oil derricks, carrying out the drilling, dredging and pumping that will add the extra 600 hectares (1,480 acres) of land to Chep Lap Kok island needed to house a third runway

The runway is one of two megaprojects in the waters around Lantau that HKDCS and others warn could be the final nail in the coffin for the local dolphin population. Near the airport, the sound of a drill rings loud over a huge building site, a 1.5 square kilometer (0.5 sq mile) pile of stone and sand that will one day house a transportation hub at the end of a $14.9 billion , 30 kilometer (18.5 mile) long bridge and tunnel stretching from Chep Lap Kok to Macau and the Chinese city of Zhuhai, on the other side of the Pearl River Delta.

The bridge -- which the government argues is necessary as marine traffic between Hong Kong and its neighbors increases -- has been plagued by criticism since its beginning, over its environmental impact worker safety , and sprawling budget , among other issues. But most Hong Kongers do not have a say in how major development projects are approved.

Aboard Boat 36826, opinions towards the bridge are predictably negative. Mak, who was born in Macau, laughs dismissively at the government's justification. Lau says the bridge "does not benefit Hong Kong people, it just benefits businessmen who want to transport their goods more cheaply than by ferry."

"They don't care about nature," she adds. "They just want to make money."

"Most of the destruction (of nature) is non-reversible," HKDCS chairman Chang says later. "It's like we keep withdrawing money from a bank account but we never deposit anything, so now we've almost run out of money but we still want to use credit cards to continue to spend."

For Chang and others, the pink dolphin is a test of whether Hong Kong can cultivate a new approach that values nature as much as property and works to preserve the past as well as develop the future.

The bright red high-speed ferry slows to 10 knots as it crosses the boundary of the Brothers Islands Marine Park just ahead of Boat 36826.

The park, along with two others due to open in 2018 and 2019, is a protected area designated for dolphin conservation. The scheme is intended to offset disruption caused by development projects like bridge and third runway, but many dolphin advocates argue they are too little too late (the Brothers park was not opened until five years after bridge construction began) and do not reflect how the animals actually behave.

"Dolphins have a large range, you can't build marine parks for them in such fragmented places, they need a wide protected area for long term survival," Chang says as the boat passes between the two islands that give the park its name.

Pointing to the still visible building site next to Chep Lap Kok he adds: "You can imagine all the noise underwater, all the construction vessels next to the marine park. This will have a great impact on the function of the park."

In a statement, Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fishers and Conservation Department (AFCD) said any affect the twin construction projects have will be temporary.

"Once construction work is complete, the associated disturbance will cease and it is expected that habitat displacement due to construction activities will recover," the department said.

A new 2,400 hectare (5,930 acre) marine park is due to be designated following the completion of the two megaprojects. AFCD said it considered doing so earlier, while construction was ongoing, but this was deemed "not practicable."

IV: Autopsy

The corpse lay half on its back, its distended stomach facing the sky, pink underside turned a deep, ugly maroon. Flaps of yellowed skin hung off it, like peeling sunburn.

Dressed in a white boiler suit, blue surgical gloves and a dust mask, the vet leaned over and delicately sliced the animal's stomach open with a scalpel.

A smaller dolphin fell out in a spill of bloated, red intestines. The calf was gray in color, with beady eyes and a partially formed snout, and just as dead as its mother.

More than 110 dolphins have washed up on Hong Kong's beaches in the last four years, nearly all of them dead and in a state of decomposition.

Most are killed by boat strikes, or wounded by nets and ropes, says vet Paola Martelli as he flicks through dolphin x-rays in his surgery in Ocean Park -- a sprawling aquarium, zoo and theme park on the south side of Hong Kong Island.

Whenever a beached dolphin is spotted the park sends out a team to carry out an autopsy and determine the cause of death or, very occasionally, bring the still living dolphin to the park for treatment, with limited success.

"They always die. They always die," Martelli says, explaining that by the time most dolphins come into human hands, they have suffered life threatening injuries, and even those which survive initially often succumb to secondary infections.

"It's good for the heart and it's meaningful because a lot of the trouble they're in is because of us, so there's a moral obligation to try, but in terms of outcomes, it's not a species that has a good outcome," Martelli says.

Dumisa, a bottlenose dolphin, opens her mouth to accept an injection from Ocean Park chief veterinarian Paolo Martelli.

In a large building adjacent to his surgery, Ocean Park's pod of bottlenose dolphins -- a distant cousin of the pink dolphin -- swim through a series of light-blue colored pools, emitting clicks and the occasional high-pitched squeak.

One dolphin flops onto a raised platform and opens her mouth -- displaying dozens of small, white teeth and a large, muscular tongue -- to allow Martelli to carry out a routine dental exam, splashing her head in disapproval when she sees an anesthetic needle but otherwise complying happily. "She hates injections, but loves the attention," the vet says.

These dolphins, foreign imports to the city, are nevertheless the ones most familiar to many Hong Kongers, tens of thousands of whom troop through the park every year.

The Ocean Park Conservation Foundation spent upwards of $1.1 million on conservation and public awareness projects in its most recent financial year , including three major studies of the Chinese white dolphin population. Despite the park's efforts however, its executive director, Suzanne Gendron, said many visitors were still surprised to learn the pink dolphins exist.

"It's such a common response: 'oh we have Chinese white dolphins, we have pink dolphins in our waters? I've only seen the ones at Ocean Park'," she said.

V: Up a creek

Boat 36826 rocks violently as the Benita Schulte , a colossal, 50,000 ton Liberian-flagged cargo ship powers past, carrying red, green and blue stacked containers en route to the Port of Hong Kong, one of the busiest in the world

Last year, more than 370,000 vessels passed through the port, including huge container ships, small fishing boats, high-speed ferries, tugs, and cargo vessels of all shapes and sizes, churning up the water around them as they joined the constant stream of marine traffic into and out from the Pearl River Delta (PRD).

The delta region stretches from the Chinese metropolises of Guangzhou, Dongguan and Foshan in the north, to Hong Kong and Macau in the south, where three rivers and a host of small tributaries meet and combine as they pour into the sea.

The PRD is home to the world's largest population of Chinese white dolphins, estimated to less than 2,500 individuals , a minority of whom live and hunt in Hong Kong waters. Exactly how many is, like many things to do with dolphins, subject to some controversy

According to AFCD figures, the Hong Kong dolphin population currently sits at 47, down from around 90 in 2010. While some research suggests those 47 are part of a larger transient group of a couple hundred, not all of whom live in Hong Kong waters year round, all agree the numbers are dropping.

In a statement, AFCD said the drop in numbers for Hong Kong dolphins may be due in part to them shifting their habitat to Chinese waters, something the department predicted would be reversed once conditions in the city improve again.

Dolphins are moving, but that doesn't mean they're headed into safer or more hospitable locations, said WWF's Lee. South of Hong Kong is one of the world's busiest shipping corridors, while in the north and west, Chinese cities have many of the same problems as Hong Kong -- land reclamation, marine traffic, and pollution.

"If the dolphins are forced the leave the Hong Kong area to the rest of the Pearl River Delta, then the threat to them is greater," Lee said. "The entire population could die out."

This makes the fight to save dolphins in Hong Kong all the more important. Not only are conservationists seeking to save the city's native population, they want to prove that such a feat is possible, that a downward trend can be corrected.

They are pushing back at something which has plagued conservationists for centuries -- shifting baseline syndrome -- where each generation's perceptions of what is possible are shaped by what they grew up with.

"Overfishing may eat away at fish stocks, or even drive species extinct," explains Jon Mooallem in " Wild Ones ," his book on the topic. "But when the next generation of scientists start their careers, they don't see the oceans as depleted; that depleted condition becomes their baseline, against which they'll measure any subsequent losses in their lifetimes."

Much of the time, baselines are shifting in the direction of a denuded, lesser nature -- more extinctions, more endangered species. But very occasionally, the opposite occurs.

It's successes like these that keep the pink dolphin conservationists going -- educating people about reducing pollution and marine waste, encouraging them to lobby the government, and pushing for a development policy that puts nature on par with profit.

A tubboat passes by Hong Kong International Airport towards Victoria Harbor.

There's a point when, staring at the sea for hours on end, everything looks like it could be a dolphin. Every white cap is a head sticking out of the water, every piece of flotsam is a dorsal fin.

After eight hours of searching, Boat 36826 slows as it passes under a section of the bridge, a giant outcrop of grey concrete covered in spindly metal scaffolding. As the boat enters Tung Chung Bay, in the shadow of the airport, the crew begins stowing their equipment.

The clipboard Mak was holding at the beginning of the day is now covered in writing, a record of the boat's journey from near Kowloon, north to the border with China, to its end point on Lantau island. In the rightmost column, titled "sighting," is one entry repeated 22 times: "no."

Chang shrugs as he, Mak and Lau stand on the pier, their hair windswept and salty, their faces and clothes specked with seawater. He should be used to this by now, he admits, "but I still feel disappointed every time."

They go out again the next day.

__label__world (CNN) Millions of years ago, precious gem stones from the heart of southern Africa washed westward along the Orange River and emptied into the Atlantic Ocean.

While some swept up on the beaches along the Namibian coast , spurring a diamond rush in 1908, others came to rest on the ocean floor. For a little while at least.

Today, six ships comb the ocean, sucking sediment from the seabed. The immense vessels are operated by Debmarine Namibia, a joint venture between the Namibian Government and diamond giant De Beers.

Last year the marine diamond mining company produced 1.378 million carats of diamonds, at a time when the country's land operations are waning.

To ramp up production, Debmarine Namibia plans to construct a $142 million ship-cum-tanker, which it says will be the world's largest custom-built diamond mining vessel , measuring 577 feet long. It hopes this new vessel will join the fleet by 2021.

This type of vehicle -- called a crawler ship -- has a 280-ton mechanical arm that moves in a horizontal arc, dredging material from just beneath the sea floor, at depths of around 400 feet.

Diamonds are then sifted from the dredged gravel in a sophisticated treatment plant onboard the ship. The gravel is returned to the ocean and the gems are securely sealed in containers, loaded into steel briefcases, and flown by helicopter to shore.

No human hands touch the diamonds during the entire production process at sea.

Gems in a haystack

Debmarine Namibia has a license to operate off the coast of Namibia until 2035 within a 2,316 square mile area -- just under half the size of Jamaica.

But, while the ships mine 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, they're not scouring every last square mile, explains Otto Shikongo, CEO of Debmarine Namibia.

"You only mine areas which are mineable and profitable," Shikongo tells CNN. "It doesn't mean that every place that you find diamonds you go mine."

He says Debmarine Namibia has depleted a total of 50 square miles since production began in 2002, just two percent of the license area.

"The resource is patchy and not homogenous," he says, adding that the future of the mining will depend on their understanding of the seabed and technological advances.

"It's not the same as a land-based resource which you can see with your eyes ... this one is 120 meters [393 feet] under the water," he says.

Every so often Debmarine Namibia sends out unmanned, autonomous vehicles -- much like underwater drones -- to survey the seabed using sonar technology.

The team also makes use of a two-person submarine to examine the geology of the seafloor.

Next, a 12,000 ton exploration vessel scoops large samples from areas that are believed to hold diamonds.

To date these combined technologies have identified a mineralized area -- or an area containing diamonds -- of 617 square miles. This makes up just over a quarter of the total license area.

The hope is to discover more diamond-containing areas through further exploration and sampling, explains Shikongo.

Survival of the fittest

While marine diamonds may be difficult to find, they're certainly worth the hunt.

Shikongo explains how nature ensured that only the "fittest" diamonds survived the journey along the Orange River, while weaker, imperfect stones were destroyed.

"Because the diamonds went through a high energy process, almost like a tumbling effect, only the best, high quality diamonds survived and made it to the sea," he says.

As a result, Shikongo estimates that 95% of diamonds recovered from the sea are of "gem quality," compared to just 40-60% of diamonds from land operations.

Employees grade and store rough diamonds at the Namibian Diamonds Trading Company in Windhoek, Namibia.

Environmental cost?

But, in the search for these precious gems, thousands of tons of sediment is dredged up and then dumped overboard.

Marine scientists argue that seabed mining degrades the marine environment, potentially impacting marine species.

"The waters off the coast of Namibia are an important area for a high diversity of resident and migratory species, such as sharks, whales, dolphins and seals," Kirsten Thompson, a marine scientist from the University of Exeter, tells CNN over email.

"Marine mining removes parts of the seabed with heavy machinery and habitat recovery from this type of disturbance can take decades."

But Shikongo says Debmarine Namibia continually monitors its footprint.

According to Shikongo, the company's environmental monitoring program found that it takes between two to 10 years for the seabed, and associated marine life, to recover.

However, in rockier terrains natural recovery could take more than 10 years.

Thompson adds that diamond mining can impact ocean life through increased ship traffic, noise, light and pollution, and is just one of many activities degrading the marine environment.

"Marine species are already experiencing profound changes due to climate change and other human-related activities, such as fishing, plastic pollution and shipping," she says.

"Some species and habitats are simply not resilient enough to cope with these multiple stresses simultaneously."

Offshore mining is increasingly important for the diamond industry in Namibia, as land-based production begins to tail off.

"Land operations have been there since 1908," explains Shikongo. "So these resources are not finite as we know and as time goes ... production tends to taper down."

Debmarine Namibia commenced marine mining operations in 2002, with a haul of approximately 500,000 carats . At the time, sister company Namdeb's land operations were producing around a million carats.

But over the years the tables have turned and marine operations now account for close to 75% of total diamond production in the country, according to Namibia's Chamber of Mines

With all eyes on the Atlantic, the question remains: How soon will we exhaust this precious underwater resource?

Shikongo believes there are probably enough stones scattered across the Atlantic seabed for Debmarine Namibia to continue mining for at least the next 20 years.

The only challenge is finding them.
__label__world (CNN) Every July, people from all across Canada travel to Ottawa for Bluesfest, one of the country's largest music festivals.

But this year, preparations for the festival are on hold to protect one very special attendee: a mother bird and her nest.

Workers discovered the bird, a killdeer, guarding her four eggs while they were setting up one of the festival's main stages. The breed is protected by the Canadian government and cannot be moved without federal permission.

"I have to say this is one of the most challenging problems that we've been presented with recently," Bluesfest executive director Mark Monahan told reporters.

A parent killdeer may abandon the eggs if they are moved more than a few feet, Carleton University naturalist Michael Runtz told CNN partner CBC

__label__politics (CNN) Following Sen. John McCain's death over the weekend, it was a hella depressing week in politics.

But, as in all rough times, you can eventually find some moments of levity if you look long and hard enough.

Here's some happier moments you may have missed:

President Donald Trump had a big trade announcement on Monday, so he brought in special guest Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to help him. And by "brought in" I mean "attempted to put on speakerphone." Apparently it was not a thing someone decided to troubleshoot beforehand.

In what was definitely one of the most relatable moments of the Trump presidency so far, technology turned on him , and he had to get an aide to fix it. Look at how many buttons he had to push! Most cheat codes require fewer strokes.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Favorable views of the Democratic Party have dropped to their lowest mark in more than a quarter century of polling, according to new numbers from a CNN poll conducted by SSRS .

Only 37% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Democrats, down from 44% in March of this year. A majority, 54%, have an unfavorable view, matching their highest mark in polls from CNN and SSRS, CNN/ORC and CNN/USA Today/Gallup stretching back to 1992.

The rating includes low favorable ratings from some core Democratic groups, including nonwhites (48%) and people under 35 years old (33%). The numbers come amid recent feuds and divisions in the Democratic Party, as former interim chair Donna Brazile's new book has unveiled new questions about infighting during the 2016 presidential campaign.

But the Republican Party isn't doing any better, with just 30% of Americans holding a favorable view. That's essentially the same as September, when the rating hit its lowest point in polling back to 1992 , but down from 42% in March. A broad 6 in 10, 61%, have an unfavorable opinion.

This means both parties sit at or near rock bottom as voters go to the polls across the country on Tuesday, most prominently in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as dozens of local and mayoral races nationwide.

A substantial 33% of liberals and 41% of conservatives have unfavorable views of the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively. Plus, 4 in 10 independents, 42%, say they have an unfavorable view of both parties vs. only 8% who say they have a favorable view of both.

Indeed, a bare majority of Americans, 51%, say it's bad for the country that the Republican Party is in control of Congress. Only 38% say GOP control is good for the nation. That's worse than at any point in CNN's polling on the Democratic majority in Congress between 2007 and 2010.

A look ahead to 2018

But at least for now, all of those negatives for the GOP appear to outweigh the Democrats' decline in popularity when it comes to the ballot box, with Democrats continuing to hold a lead on a generic congressional ballot. Democrats top Republicans on that question by a wide 12 percentage points, 50% to 38%. That's similar to a 14-point gap between the two parties last month.

Republicans and Democrats remain almost unanimously united behind their own candidates in 2018, but Democrats hold a crucial 10-point lead among independents.

There are more warning signs for Democrats in this poll. Overall, 36% of registered voters who identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting next year, down from 44% who said so in September. That puts Democratic enthusiasm on par with that of Republicans, which stands at 37%.

And there are signs in the poll that more of next year's vote may be driven by dislike of a party than affection for one.

Sweeping majorities of voters have unfavorable views of the party they won't support in 2018: 87% of people who say they'd back a Democrat have an unfavorable view of the Republican Party, and 89% of those who say they'll back the Republican have a negative view of the Democrats.

Still, a sizable number view the party they do plan to vote for unfavorably: A third of voters on both sides, 32%, say they have an unfavorable view of the party whose candidate they say they'll support in 2018.

Trump's record unpopularity , now down to just 36% approval, also bleeds into the midterm elections: Roughly the same number, 35%, say they'd be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports Trump over one who opposes the president, down from 41% in April.

Americans say their own member of Congress deserves re-election in November, 46% to 39%, with a sizable 15% unsure. But two-thirds, 65%, say most members of Congress don't deserve re-election. Even among Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, 51% say most members aren't worthy of another term.

The future of GOP tax reform

On the Republican tax reform plan, only 31% of Americans say they support the GOP tax reform proposals in Congress. Less than half, 45%, say they oppose the plans, down from 52% last month, when the question wording included Donald Trump's name. A quarter have no opinion on GOP tax reform plans.

Support for the tax plan overall is largely split down party lines: 64% of Republicans, 31% of independents and 8% of Democrats say they support the plan.

Only 21% say they will be better off under the GOP tax plan vs. 32% who say they will be worse off, similar to the divide in October before details of the plan were released. And by a two-to-one margin, Americans say it would increase the deficit instead of shrinking it, 40% to 18%.

Republican leaders in Congress have said they hope to pass sweeping tax reform legislation by the end of December, adding at least one major legislative accomplishment in their first year.

Majorities of Americans oppose some core tenets of the GOP tax plan: 52% say they oppose lowering the corporate tax rate, 56% say they oppose repealing the estate tax and 52% oppose eliminating deductions for state and local income and sales taxes.

Still, majorities back some parts: a broad, bipartisan 79% say they support increasing the child tax credit and 55% say they favor increasing the standard deduction. About half of Americans, 49%, say they favor limiting the home interest deduction to only $500,000 worth of mortgage debt.

The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS by telephone Nov. 2 to Nov. 5 among a random national sample of 1,021 adults. The margin of sampling error for results among the full sample is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.
__label__politics (CNN) On Wednesday afternoon, Fox News released a snippet of its interview with President Donald Trump. (The interview is set to run in its entirety on Thursday morning). Here's the exchange between Fox's Ainsley Earhardt and Trump on whether he knew about payments arranged by his one-time lawyer Michael Cohen to women alleging affairs with Trump in the run-up to the 2016 election:

Earhardt: "Did you know about the payments?"

Trump: "Later on I knew. Later on. But you have to understand, Ainsley, what he did -- and they weren't taken out of campaign finance, that's the big thing. That's a much bigger thing. Did they come out of the campaign? They didn't come out of the campaign, they came from me. And I tweeted about it. You know, I put -- I don't know if you know but I tweeted about the payments. But they didn't come out of campaign. In fact, my first question when I heard about it was did they come out of the campaign because that could be a little dicey. And they didn't come out of the campaign and that's big. But they weren't -- that's not a -- it's not even a campaign violation. If you look at President Obama, he had a massive campaign violation but he had a different attorney general and they viewed it a lot differently."

There's so much wrong here. Let's go through it point by point.

1. Trump says he knew about the payments -- $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels, $150,000 from American Media Inc. to ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal -- "later on." That runs directly counter to what Trump said in April when asked about the Cohen payment to Daniels. Here's that exchange:
__label__politics (CNN) Barbara Bush, the matriarch of a Republican political dynasty and a first lady who elevated the cause of literacy, died Tuesday, according to a statement from her husband's office. She was 92.

Only the second woman in American history to have had a husband and a son elected President (Abigail Adams was the first), Bush was seen as a plainspoken public figure who was instantly recognizable with her signature white hair and pearl necklaces and earrings. She became a major political figure as her husband, George H.W. Bush, rose to become vice president and president. After they left the White House, she was a potent spokeswoman for two of her sons -- George W. and Jeb -- as they campaigned for office.

The mother of six children -- one of whom, a daughter, Robin, died as a child from leukemia -- Barbara Bush raised her fast-growing family in the 1950s and '60s amid the post-war boom of Texas and the whirl of politics that consumed her husband.

She was at his side during his nearly 30-year political career. He was a US representative for Texas, UN ambassador, Republican Party chairman, ambassador to China and CIA director. He then became Ronald Reagan's vice president for two terms and won election to the White House in 1988. He left office in 1993 after losing a re-election bid to Bill Clinton.

Quick-witted with a sharp tongue, the feisty Barbara Bush was a fierce defender of her husband and an astute adviser.

As first lady, her principal persona as a devoted wife and mother contrasted in many ways with her peer and predecessor, Nancy Reagan, and her younger successor, Hillary Clinton, both of whom were seen as more intimately involved in their husbands' presidencies.

Still, Barbara Bush promoted women's rights, and her strong personal views sometimes surfaced publicly and raised eyebrows -- especially when they clashed with Republican Party politics. For instance, she once said as her husband ran for president that abortion should not be politicized.

She also was not shy about the possibility of a female president, disarming a Wellesley College audience at a 1990 appearance protested by some on campus who questioned her credentials to address female graduates aiming for the workplace.

"Somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow my footsteps and preside over the White House as the president's spouse.

"I wish him well," she said.

Childhood and family life

Barbara Pierce was born June 8, 1925, in New York and raised in the upscale town of Rye. She attended a prestigious boarding school in South Carolina, where she met her future husband at a school dance when she was only 16 and he was a year older. A year and a half and countless love letters later, the two were engaged just before George Bush enlisted in the Navy and went off to fight in World War II.

Bush, who was the youngest fighter pilot in the Navy at the time, would return home a war hero, after being shot down by the Japanese. He had flown 58 combat missions and received the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery. By that time, Barbara had dropped out of Smith College and the pair were married in January 1945.

They raised their family mainly in Texas, where George H.W. Bush, the son of a US senator, was in the oil business and later entered politics.

Barbara Bush's dedication to keeping order at home earned her the nickname "the enforcer."

"We were rambunctious a lot, pretty independent-minded kids, and, you know, she had her hands. Dad, of course, was available, but he was a busy guy. And he was on the road a lot in his businesses and obviously on the road a lot when he was campaigning. And so Mother was there to maintain order and discipline. She was the sergeant," George W. Bush told CNN in 2016.

With her husband as vice president in the 1980s, Bush adopted literacy as a cause, raising awareness and eventually launching the nonprofit Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. After George H.W. Bush's presidency, he and Barbara raised more than $1 billion for literacy and cancer charities.

"I chose literacy because I honestly believe that if more people could read, write, and comprehend, we would be that much closer to solving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our society," she said.

A writer, her books include an autobiography and one about post-White House life. Her children's book about their dog, Millie, and her puppies written during her White House years was, as were her other books, a bestseller.

On the campaign trail

In 2001, when George W. Bush took office, Barbara Bush became the only woman in American history to live to see her husband and son elected president.

She campaigned for son George W. and fiercely defended him from critics after he became president.

Asked in a 2013 interview about the prospect that her younger son, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, might mount a White House campaign in 2016, Bush quipped in her dry fashion, "We've had enough Bushes."

But when Jeb decided to run, she changed her mind and campaigned for him, appearing in a video for Jeb Bush's ultimately unsuccessful campaign, saying, "I think he'll be a great president."

She also was outspoken about Donald Trump. In one of her last interviews, the former first lady said in early 2016 she was "sick" of Trump, who belittled her son repeatedly during the 2016 GOP primary campaign, adding that she doesn't "understand why people are for him."

"I'm a woman," she added. "I'm not crazy about what he says about women."

Most recently, Bush published a note in the spring edition of Smith College's alumnae magazine, where she declared: "I am still old and still in love with the man I married 72 years ago."

The college awarded Bush an honorary degree in 1989.

Bush battled health problems for much of her later life. She was diagnosed in 1988 with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disease that commonly affects the thyroid. She had open-heart surgery in 2009 and in 2008 underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer.

In her final years, she was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, better known as COPD, as well as congestive heart failure. But, along with her husband, she kept an active public schedule, raising money for charity.

Bush is survived by her husband, George H.W.; sons George W., Neil, Marvin and Jeb; daughter, Dorothy Bush Koch; and 17 grandchildren.
__label__politics They're using the threat of impeachment to get out the vote and almost daring Democrats: Go ahead, impeach this guy.

Both President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell brought it up in recent days.

"I don't even bring it up," said Trump at a rally in Montana, as he launched into a riff on the subject. "Because I view it as something that, you know, they like to use the impeach word. Impeach Trump. Maxine Waters, 'We will impeach him.' But he didn't do anything wrong. 'It doesn't matter, we will impeach him. We will impeach.' But I say, how do you impeach somebody that's doing a great job that hasn't done anything wrong?"

The President warned that impeaching him would lead to a sort of impeachment-off against successive administrations. He also issued a warning to his supporters: If you don't vote, he suggested, I'll get impeached.

"But we'll worry about that if it ever happens. But if it does happen, it's your fault, because you didn't go out to vote. OK? You didn't go out to vote. You didn't go out to vote. That's the only way it could happen. I'll be the only president in history -- they'll say what a job he's done. By the way, we're impeaching him."

And McConnell's impeachment reference came during an interview with the conservative host Hugh Hewitt, who asked about whether a President could be indicted.

"I'm a lawyer, but not a good one. ... The Justice Department, I gather, has taken the position under a president of both parties that the appropriate remedy for presidential misbehavior is impeachment," McConnell told Hewitt in a taped MSNBC interview. "I'm not an expert on this, but I hear that's the case."

Democrats, meanwhile, have shied away from the idea. Nancy Pelosi, who really wants to be speaker of the House again, and if Democrats took control of the House, would basically have the ability to quash an impeachment effort, said last month it would only help Republicans and Trump.

"I don't think we should be talking about impeachment. I've been very clear right from the start," Pelosi said recently on Capitol Hill. "On the political side I think it's a gift to the Republicans."

The country, by the way, has inched toward favoring impeachment for Trump, but they're still a ways off from agreement.

Forty-nine percent of Americans supported beginning impeachment proceedings in an ABC News / Washington Post poll at the end of August . Democrats (75%) were strongly in favor and Republicans (82%) were strongly opposed. Independents were more evenly split.

In a CNN poll from June, 42% of Americans said Trump should be impeached. But that's about the percentage who supported impeaching Nixon in 1974 when he resigned as the House moved against him. A larger percentage support impeaching Trump now than supported impeaching Trump then. But Nixon faced a hostile Congress controlled by Democrats. Impeaching Trump would, he's right, basically require a Democratic majority and unanimity within the party. But removing him from office would take a Senate supermajority. Even if Democrats took control of the Senate in November, which is a long shot, they'd be nowhere near that 67 votes needed to remove him from office.

All of this is to say that while Trump wants to raise the specter of impeachment to fire up his base supporters before election day, we still feel a very long way away from a serious impeachment effort and it would almost certainly depend on what kind of report, if any, is released by special counsel Robert Mueller with regard to Russian campaign interference and possible collusion by Trump's campaign or something else that could fall into the "high crimes and misdemeanors" category.

With that important disclaimer, here's what would have to happen:

It's a complicated process

Considering how short the document is, the Constitution takes up quite a bit of space on the matter, spelling things out for the House, the Senate and the Executive in Articles I and II.

In Article I, Section 2:

The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.

In Article II, Section 3:

The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.

Judgment in Cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.

In Article II, Section 4:

The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

In plain English, that means first, there needs to be evidence that Trump committed treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors . Not just any crimes and misdemeanors, mind you. High ones. For Clinton, he was accused of perjury and obstruction of justice. For Nixon, list was longer and passed through a House committee as part of three articles. Regardless, it is an extremely broad and subjective target and there's been a lot of scholarship about exactly what it means. This country has historically shown a willingness to give its chief executive a lot of latitude. So, what next?

How would it happen?

The full House would authorize one of its committees, usually the judiciary committee, to investigate and consider impeachment, according to an overview from the Congressional Research Service

That committee conducts an investigation and draws up articles of impeachment.

They then vote in that committee on whether to refer some or all of the articles to the full House.

The Clinton impeachment trial on the Senate floor in Washington D.C. on February 12, 1999. Prompted by the Lewinsky sex scandal, the United States Senate acquitted him on February 12, 1999.

If the committee votes to impeach, they prepare a report for the full House, which then debates and votes on the articles. The House can approve some of the articles and not others. In the case of Bill Clinton, for instance, two of four articles were approved by the full House

If the full House votes for impeachment on a simple majority, the approved articles are then referred to the Senate, which conducts a trial. Chief Justice John Roberts would preside, according to the Constitution. Members of the House lead the prosecution and senators are jurors.

Senators then meet in closed session and vote on whether to convict and remove from office. A conviction requires a two-thirds majority. That's 67 senators. Sixty-seven!

Republicans control the House and Senate

Both Nixon, who wasn't actually impeached, and Clinton, who was impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate, were facing off against a hostile Congress controlled by the opposing party. So was Andrew Johnson, the Democratic vice president who succeeded Abraham Lincoln as president after his assassination and was impeached by the hostile Republicans who controlled Capitol Hill. He was acquitted too. Got that? the Senate is 0-for-2 on convicting presidents from the other political party.

Republicans -- Trump is a Republican, remember -- have a 237-193 majority in the House. That means 20 or more Republicans, depending on who is voting, would have to break ranks to impeach their Republican President.

Those numbers will obviously change after election day, and that's when you might hear Pelosi change her tune on impeachment, especially if Democrats can achieve a large majority. The smaller the majority, the less feasible impeachment would be. If Republicans keep the House, impeachment seems essentially off the table.

The House, however, is the easy part.

Republicans currently have 51 senators, so 19 of them would have to break ranks and vote to convict a Republican president, assuming all Democrats voted to do so.

Nixon, by the way, resigned before impeachment went to a vote in the full House of Representatives. In that case, most of the Republicans on the judiciary committee opposed the articles.

Republicans have not turned on Trump

There is not even a critical mass of Republicans who think there should be a special prosecutor to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Exactly zero Republicans have said anything close to supportive of impeachment. Trump is likely to be protected by his Republican allies in the Senate even if Democrats gain majorities in both houses and decided to try to impeach him.

Impeachment is extremely rare

Just 19 people -- two presidents, one senator, one secretary of war and 15 judges -- have been impeached by the House and tried in the Senate. Of those, only eight were convicted. Seven, including both impeached presidents, were acquitted. Charges were dropped against three others after they were either expelled from office or resigned.

Most officials who get to the point of impeachment would rather resign a la Nixon than face a public trial in the Senate. The US also has regular elections, including the midterms in November and Trump's planned bid for re-election in 2020. A representative or senator is more likely to be expelled from their respective body by their peers or kept from re-election by the voters.

It takes a long time

The impeachment process takes months and months. There are years of this administration in front of us, but the impeachment process would seem like an eternity in the Trump era if the current pace of news keeps up. The House first voted to consider impeaching Nixon in February 1974. The House judiciary committee didn't vote on an article of impeachment until July 24. Nixon resigned on August 8 of that year before the full House had voted.

Clinton was acquitted by the Senate, although a majority voted against him, on February 13, 1999
__label__politics (CNN) John McCain was admired by supporters and adversaries for his bravery as a military warrior and his courage to rise above party politics.

Here are some of the late senator's more memorable comments:

After his capture in North Vietnam

When given a chance to send a message back home after his A-4 Skyhawk was shot down in 1967 and he was captured in North Vietnam, he said:

"I would just like to tell my wife I'm, I'll get well. I love her, and hope to see her soon. I appreciate if you will tell her."

This picture taken in 1967 shows McCain lying on a bed in a Hanoi hospital.

Respecting his opponents

In the late 1980s, Mo Elleithee, a Democratic campaign strategist who was 16 at the time, met the senator.

Mo Elleithee: "I'm honored to meet you even though I disagree with you."

McCain: "Well, I'm honored to represent you even though you disagree with me."

Dear @SenJohnMcCain,



At 16, I got to meet my 1st term Sen.



Me: "I'm honored 2 meet u even though I disagree w/you."



You: "Well, I'm honored 2 represent u even though u disagree w/me."



Even when I worked against u, you were a role model. Just want u to know that. Thank you. pic.twitter.com/5OitjNZofH — Mo Elleithee (@MoElleithee) August 24, 2018

Taking the blame

When running for President in 2000, he changed his public stance about the Confederate battle flag after he told South Carolina voters the banner stood as a symbol of heritage.

"I did not do so for one reason alone. I feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win the South Carolina primary. So I chose to compromise my principles. I broke my promise to always tell the truth."

Then Republican presidential nomination hopefuls George W. Bush, Gary Bauer and John McCain debated in Durham, North Carolina in 2000.

Speaking up for Obama

A man said on the 2008 campaign trail that he had concerns about Barack Obama, telling McCain, "We're scared of an Obama presidency ... I'm concerned about someone that cohorts with domestic terrorists ..."

McCain responded, amid boos, "I have to tell you he's a decent person, and a person that you do not have to be scared of as President of the United States."

Loving America

"I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's. I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency; for its faith in the wisdom, justice and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's."

Getting back up after losing a presidential election

"I remind all my colleagues: We had an election. I think the message the American people are sending us now is they want us to work together, and get to work."

On being called a maverick

"That was a label that was given to me a long time ago. I don't decide on the labels that I am given. I said I have always acted in what I think is in the best interests of the state and the country, and that's the way that I will always behave."

Reaching across the aisle

Sen. John McCain arrived to the Senate chamber with a visible scar above his eye.

Less than two weeks after surgery to remove a blood clot revealed McCain had brain cancer, he returned to the Senate to vote against his party's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That night, he delivered an epic 15-minute speech

"Our deliberations today -- not just our debates, but the exercise of all our responsibilities -- authorizing government policies, appropriating the funds to implement them, exercising our advice and consent role - are often lively and interesting. They can be sincere and principled. But they are more partisan, more tribal more of the time than any other time I remember. Our deliberations can still be important and useful, but I think we'd all agree they haven't been overburdened by greatness lately. And right now they aren't producing much for the American people."

"We're getting nothing done, my friends," McCain told his colleagues. "We're getting nothing done."

Remembering his tough times in Annapolis

"My superiors didn't hold me in very high esteem in those days. Their disapproval was measured in the hundreds of miles of extra duty I marched in my time here," McCain told Naval Academy graduates at Annapolis, Maryland, last year.

Reflecting on his decades-long political history

After he was awarded the National Constitution Center's annual Liberty Medal in 2017 for his lifetime of sacrifice and service to the nation, he delivered a pointed speech.

"I've had the good fortune to spend 60 years in service to this wondrous land. It has not been perfect service, to be sure, and there were probably times when the country might have benefited from a little less of my help. But I've tried to deserve the privilege as best I can, and I've been repaid a thousand times over with adventures, with good company, and with the satisfaction of serving something more important than myself, of being a bit player in the extraordinary story of America. And I am so very grateful."

Envisioning his legacy

In an interview with "60 Minutes," he discussed the way he wanted to be remembered.

"I want ... when I leave, that the ceremony is at the Naval Academy. And we just have a couple of people that stand up and say, 'This guy, he served his country.'"
__label__politics CNN's KFile reviewed several months of audio from Rep. Jason Lewis on the "Jason Lewis Show," a syndicated radio program Lewis hosted from 2009 until 2014 with the tagline "America's Mr. Right." In one instance, while arguing that "young single women" vote based on coverage of birth control pills, Lewis said those women were not human beings and were without brains.

Lewis, who was narrowly elected to represent Minnesota's 2nd District in 2016, is considered one of the most endangered House Republicans in the midterm election. CNN rates the race as a "toss up," the most competitive designation.

Lewis can be heard on the radio repeatedly demeaning women, and particularly women voters, in 15 months of audio provided to KFile by Michael Brodkorb, the former deputy chair of the Republican Party of Minnesota. Brodkorb, who is currently a columnist for the MinnPost and works in public affairs, initially revealed some of Lewis' radio comments in a column in February 2016 . KFile contacted Brodkorb after seeing his 2016 column and requested raw audio files of Lewis' show, which he provided.

When radio host Rush Limbaugh called women's rights activists and then-graduate student Sandra Fluke "a slut" in February 2012, Lewis repeatedly expressed disbelief that people could no longer refer to women as sluts.

"Well, the thing is, can we call anybody a slut? This is what begs the question. Take this woman out of it, take Rush out of it for a moment," Lewis said in a March 2012 episode. "Does a woman now have the right to behave -- and I know there's a double standard between the way men chase women and running and running around -- you know, I'm not going to get there, but you know what I'm talking about. But it used to be that women were held to a little bit of a higher standard. We required modesty from women. Now, are we beyond those days where a woman can behave as a slut, but you can't call her a slut?"

Fluke, a law student at Georgetown at the time, found herself at the center of a national controversy in early 2012 after Limbaugh attacked her following her testimony to a Democratic congressional group. In her testimony, Fluke said that students paid as much as $1,000 a year for contraceptives and made the case that religious institutions should cover birth control. She said she was "stunned" and "outraged" by Limbaugh's remarks.

Lewis, who was a regular fill-in for Limbaugh's national radio show, also offered a defense of the right-wing radio host for his comments on Fluke, saying, "Now Limbaugh's reasoning was, look, if you're demanding that the taxpayers pay for your contraception, you must use a lot of them and therefore, ergo, you're very sexually active and in the old days, what we used to call people who were in college or even graduate school who were sexually active, we called them sluts."

He continued, "Especially if you want somebody to pay for it. Now you know, obviously that's a stretch. It was meant as an aspect of entertainment radio."

He continued, "But have we really got to the point where you can't refer to Madonna as a slut without being sued? I mean, Madonna has had a series of lovers, as have many in Hollywood. Now in the old days, what did we call this? Madonna dresses up in these sorts of prostitute-like outfits on stage, and she goes there and she sings and she shows half of her body. What did we call those people? 30 years ago? 40 years ago? 50 years ago? You can't do that today, it's too politically incorrect?"

Lewis, during a December 2012 segment on changes in the culture, said, "Only we can tell our young women, 'don't look like some slut and you won't get hit on.'"

In a statement, Lewis' campaign defended his comments.

"This has all been litigated before, and as Congressman Lewis has said time and time again, it was his job to be provocative while on the radio," Lewis' campaign manager Becky Alery said in a statement.

Lewis' time as a radio show host initially came under scrutiny during the 2016 campaign. In addition to Brodkorb's column, The Atlantic magazine dubbed Lewis Minnesota's "Mini Trump" in an article that reviewed a sampling of comments he made about women and minorities, including a comment in which he called young female voters "ignorant of the important issues in life" who needed to be educated.

Lewis' shocking comments from his show flew under the radar at the time, and some of his most inflammatory comments about women, including his views on the term "slut," were never previously reported. Minnesota Democrats called on Lewis to release his full radio show archive, but he dismissed their demands a "distraction" and claimed his comments would be taken "out of context."

Echoing comments reported by Brodkorb and The Atlantic, Lewis on several more occasions described women voters as guided by emotion instead of reason and said they voted solely on the issue of free birth control. Lewis at times seemingly confused the kinds of birth control covered by health insurance policies.

On an August 2012 show, Lewis speculated that then-President Barack Obama led with women because of this.

"To the degree that the Republicans or conservatives or Mitt Romney has an issue with the women, maybe it isn't Mitt Romney or his positions. Maybe it's the women," Lewis said. "We all know that women tend to vote more liberal than men. It is the women who are guided by more emotion than reason. 'Oh, here we go, stereotyping, stereotyping females once again. What are you doing?' Well, I'm not running for anything. I'm just making an observation."

He added, "One of the reasons that the Democrats love the quote unquote female issue is because they know women vote more liberally than men do. Now you could say in a very, very sexist, misogynistic way that, 'well, that's because women just don't understand money. They don't understand, they're, they don't handle finances. They're guided by emotion not reason. Why, that's why they didn't have the vote for a full century in the country.' Well, it is true that women cast more votes for Democrats. All I'm saying, I'm not validating the stereotype. I'm married to a woman for heaven's sakes, but I will say this: Do not, do not pander and move left to get the female vote."

In a November 2012 broadcast, Lewis said women, by voting for Democrats, played into the stereotype that they don't think.

"So there is something here going on with women who are playing into that stereotype that they're not thinking," he said. "Oh, 'I know that's awfully prejudicial because the only way you can think is it a vote Republican, Jason.' I'm not saying voting Republican, but when you reliably almost a knee-jerk Democrat vote -- is birth control really that important to you ladies? Is that really the most important thing that you get your condoms for free? Now you've gotten Madonna, you know, running around and slutty outfits and Sandra Fluke telling everybody I'm not going to pay a dime for my diaphragm. Is that really what's important to women? I can't believe that. And yet there's this gender gap every election cycle. Women go Democrat."

The next day, Lewis argued that "young single women" who voted based on coverage of birth control pills had ceased to be human beings.

"You can be bought off for that?" he said. "I mean, boy, that's the, all the other issues: the Hispanic problem, social issues, class warfare, you know, we can figure out a way to tackle those. This one, if you're that far down the road and you say you're a human being, I've got my suspicions. You're not, you're without a brain. You have no, you have no cognitive function whatsoever. If that's all it takes to buy you off."

Representatives for Madonna did not return a request for comment.

In a statement to CNN, Fluke said, "Jason Lewis' attitude toward the women of his district and this country is incredibly insulting and beneath any member of the United States Congress. Americans stood with me and resoundingly rejected such uncivil and demeaning attacks from public figures back in 2012. Since then, the brave women of the #MeToo movement have again reminded all of us that disparaging women with insults like 'slut" and "parasite,' is an attempt to silence them from speaking up and fighting for comprehensive healthcare they can afford."
__label__politics (CNN) New York GOP Rep. Chris Collins vowed to fight the criminal charges against him in court and win re-election, hours after federal prosecutors arrested him on accusations that he took part in insider trading.

"The charges that have been levied against me are meritless," Collins said Wednesday. "And I will mount a vigorous defense in court to clear my name. I look forward to being fully vindicated and exonerated."

Federal prosecutors on Wednesday charged Collins, his son and another man with 13 counts of securities fraud, wire fraud and false statements stemming from an alleged insider trading scheme centered on an Australian pharmaceutical company. He could face up to 150 years in prison if convicted on all counts, according to Nick Biase, a spokesman for the US Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York.

Collins, who was the first sitting member of Congress to endorse Donald Trump's presidential bid , surrendered Wednesday morning at his attorney's office in Manhattan, according to the FBI.

He told reporters Wednesday evening, during a short news conference where he did not take questions, that he would "not address any issues related to Innate Immunotherapeutics outside of the courtroom" as he sought to clear his name.

"As I fight to clear my name, rest assured, I will continue to work hard for the people and constituents of the 27th Congressional District of New York," Collins said. "And I will remain on the ballot running for re-election this November."

Prosecutors at the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York alleged in an indictment that Collins and the other defendants acted on nonpublic information about the results of a drug trial and used it to trade on the stock of the pharmaceutical company, Innate Immunotherapeutics Limited, of which Collins was a board member.

Innate Immunotherapeutics said in a statement that it had cooperated fully with requests for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the Collins indictment.

"The US media has inaccurately reported that Mr. Collins and colleagues were the beneficiaries of share issuances in the Company on privileged terms," the statement said. "Mr. Collins (and colleagues) have only ever participated in shareholder-approved share placements or 'rights issues' of shares in the Company."

The indictment doesn't allege that Collins himself traded on the information about the failed results of a drug trial, but that he passed the information to his son, Cameron Collins, so that the younger Collins could execute trades. And it alleges that the younger Collins passed the information to others, including his fiancee's father, Stephen Zarsky, who also traded on the information.

That allowed them, prosecutors allege, to avoid more than $768,000 in losses they would have incurred if they had traded the stock after the drug trial results became public. All three then lied about their actions to federal agents, according to the indictment.

"Congressman Collins cheated our market and our justice system in two ways," US Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a news conference Wednesday. "First, he tipped his son to confidential corporate information at the expense of regular investors. And then he lied about it to law enforcement to cover it up."

Collins and the other defendants pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Wednesday afternoon. Each must pay a $500,000 personal recognizance bond.

The 30-page indictment highlights that the congressman received the information about the failed drug trial from the company's CEO and then repeatedly dialed his son while the elder Collins was attending the annual congressional picnic at the White House on June 22, 2017.

At 7:10 p.m. that evening, amid the picnic, Chris Collins responded in an email to the CEO, "Wow. Makes no sense. How are these results even possible???"

One minute later, according to the indictment, Collins began placing phone calls to his son. After failing six times to connect with his son, the congressman reached him on the seventh call and informed him that the drug trial for a multiple sclerosis treatment had failed, the indictment says.

Lawyers for Collins said the congressman would be "completely vindicated."

"We will answer the charges filed against Congressman Collins in court and will mount a vigorous defense to clear his good name," Collins' attorneys, Jonathan Barr and Jonathan New, said in a statement. "It is notable that even the government does not allege that Congressman Collins traded a single share of Innate Therapeutics stock. We are confident he will be completely vindicated and exonerated."

In his remarks Wednesday evening, Collins likewise made a point of noting that he had held onto his shares even when it became clear a drug they once thought would be a "medical breakthrough" had fallen short.

"As a result, the significant investment I made in the company worth millions of dollars (was) wiped out," Collins said. "That's OK. That's the risk I took."

The indictment said Collins had been "virtually precluded from trading his own shares for practical and technical reasons" -- references to both the congressional ethics investigation that was ongoing into Collins regarding the company and that Collins' shares in the company were held in Australia, "and thus subject to the Australian trading halt."

"Accordingly, he did not trade his own stock and instead tipped Cameron Collins," the indictment read.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday that Collins would be removed from the House Energy and Commerce Committee "until the matter is settled."

"While his guilt or innocence is a question for the courts to settle, the allegations against Rep. Collins demand a prompt and thorough investigation by the House Ethics Committee," Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said in a statement. "Insider trading is a clear violation of the public trust."

It is relatively rare for prosecutors to indict a sitting elected official, particularly in an election year. In Collins' case, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York carefully weighed when to bring the charges, staying mindful of the upcoming election cycle in November, according to people familiar with the matter.

Justice Department guidelines for federal prosecutors recommend that they avoid taking investigative or prosecutorial steps that could sway voters' decisions, and the controversy over former FBI Director James Comey's public announcements during the 2016 presidential election cycle concerning the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email use have brought even closer scrutiny of such decisions.

Though the charges brought Wednesday don't pertain to Collins' conduct in his capacity as an elected official, Berman suggested in his remarks that Collins' status as a congressman enhanced the hypocrisy of his actions.

"Congressman Collins, who by virtue of his office helps to write the laws of our nation, acted as if the law did not apply to him," Berman said.

The SEC filed a parallel complaint Wednesday against the three men that seeks to bar the elder Collins from serving as a director of a public company, as well as prevent him from trading penny stocks.

The House Ethics Committee last October disclosed that it was investigating Collins for potentially violating federal law and House rules regarding insider trading. The outside, non-partisan Office of Congressional Ethics began a review of Collins' activity in March 2017 and that July voted to send its findings to the House ethics panel. The panel can formally launch investigations and recommend any sanctions against any lawmaker it determines has broken any rules. The ethics committee announced in the release of the report that it would start a review of Collins.

The report details how Collins met with officials at the National Institutes of Health to discuss the development of a drug made by Innate.

"There is a substantial reason to believe that Representative Collins shared material nonpublic information in the purchase of Innate stock, in violation of House rules, standards of conduct, and federal law," the report said.

The House Ethics Committee declined to comment on the indictment Wednesday.

It's not clear whether the indictment will imperil Collins's re-election bid. The congressman hails from a reliably Republican district in upstate New York and had been considered a safe bet to retain his seat against a little-known Democrat, Nate McMurray, who on Wednesday immediately seized on the news of the indictment to raise money for his campaign.

Despite the charges, however, Collins indicated in the hours following that he plans to pursue re-election, unnerving Republican leaders worried that the news could put yet another GOP seat in danger of flipping to the Democrats.

New York election laws leave little recourse for Republicans to push Collins out of the race and replace him with another candidate, meaning GOP leaders are likely stuck with Collins on the ballot in the November elections.

__label__politics "Wait your turn."

"Why bother?"

Paulette Jordan has heard it all, especially in the waning hours before Tuesday's Idaho primary, where she is hoping to advance her long-shot candidacy for governor of Idaho. But as she can often do, given her height of nearly six feet, the Democrat and two-term Idaho state legislator lifts her gaze above the immediate ruckus. She instead looks through the long lens of her family's indigenous history that now drives her effort to become the first Native American governor in US history.

"I come from a powerful line of women. I'm proud of that heritage and legacy," said Jordan, in response to a 'why bother?' question. "The opportunity for women is now. The President is divisive. Women know we can bring the country together. I'm working to defend my state, my people, even as this President is part of spreading hate and fear."

Paulette Jordan says her very different candidacy could be a way to win as a Democrat in the traditionally Republican state.

Jordan makes the criticism against Trump fully aware of his 2016 victory in her state, which he won by 32 points . Idaho is more than 80% white and voted Republican so long that the Idaho Statesman referred to all the Democratic candidates for governor starting in 1998 as the "sacrificial lamb in the governor's general election race." Still, the newspaper's editorial board gave her a lukewarm endorsement as "a chance to excite Idahoans looking for new leadership."

As both a Native American and a young woman, the 38-year-old believes she's the stark difference needed to crack that streak of losses racked up by those middle-aged, white male Democratic gubernatorial candidates. She's the antidote needed in the Trump era, she believes. With her youth and history-making run, her candidacy captures the most unmitigated example of a new kind of woman driven to run for higher office after Hillary Clinton's loss.

Indian Country Today counts a total of 23 Native American candidates running for statewide offices and Congress. Those candidacies can't solely be credited to a whiplash response to the 2016 election. Jordan sees it more as a growing engagement of Native Americans after the bitter history of colonization and marginalization.

Jordan's personal history speaks to that engagement. She's a member of the Coeur d'Alene tribe and traces her history back generations to the chiefs she says fought settler expansion. She was raised on a farm in rural northern Idaho and went on to the University of Washington, where she first engaged in local politics and grassroots activism. She returned home after graduation and became the youngest person elected to the Coeur d'Alene Tribal Council.

"I'm connected to the land," said Jordan, explaining her return to Idaho. "I come from that legacy of a love affair with the air and wildlife. That legacy is unique and a deep part of this state."

Jordan, seeking to expand the Native voice in state government, ran in 2014 for the Idaho House of Representatives and beat an incumbent Republican. Jordan proudly points out she was the only North Idaho progressive to win re-election in 2016.

Since her candidacy began, Jordan has captured the imagination of national progressives and the media. Last January, she spoke at the Women's March in Las Vegas, where entertainment icon Cher tweeted her all-caps admiration.

I Met & Talked With Paulette At LAS VEGAS WOMENS RALLY.I Believe The PPL Of IDAHO Would Be WELL SERVED With Paulette Jordan As Their Governor.She is a thoughtful, Caring,Intelligent,Woman,Who Would Work TIRELESSLY 2 BENEFIT"ALL THE PPL"Of IDAHO❤️ — Cher (@cher) January 24, 2018

"She's always invited to Idaho," laughed Jordan, recalling the meeting and the tweet. Support from Planned Parenthood, Indivisible and PAC Democracy for America followed.

At the Idaho state level, support from her fellow legislators hasn't been as forthcoming. Many of her fellow Idaho House Democrats are endorsing her primary opponent, A.J. Balukoff. He ran for governor in 2014 and lost by double digits to the now-outgoing Republican governor, despite spending millions of his own money in his campaign. At age 72, Balukoff is a Boise School Board member who moved to Idaho later in life. When asked about Jordan, Balukoff told the Idaho Politics Weekly , "I think people should stay with me this time around. She may be what we need the next time."

Jordan doesn't take kindly to that comment. "He thinks because of his privilege he can buy into privilege. I've rolled up my sleeves my entire life to earn my role. For someone to say, 'Step aside,' that's something women have heard before," said Jordan, her voice even but punctuated with seriousness. "This is our time."

As if doubling down in response to the "step aside" comment, Jordan chose another woman, Kristin Collum, as her running mate. Collum's campaign website describes a 12-year military career in the US Army, followed by engineering jobs in the tech sector. The two-woman ticket, in and of itself, is history-making in the state.

Asked what happens on Tuesday if she loses in the Democratic primary, Jordan replied, "We've already won. We've inspired and excited our community." Then she added, "I'll see you after Tuesday and we'll talk about the general."
__label__world (CNN) At least 12 people were killed and 50 others wounded Saturday when missiles pounded an Iranian Kurdish opposition party's base in northern Iraq, party officials said, immediately blaming Iran for the assault.

Three children and three women were among those killed in the attack on the headquarters of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, or PDKI, the party said in a statement.

The attack happened in Koysinjaq, a city about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of Erbil in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq and some 300 kilometers (186 miles) north of the capital, Baghdad.

The PDKI accused Iran for the attack on its base. "Iran used long-range missiles in a coordinated attack on PDKI's bases and adjacent refugee camps," the statement said.

It also pointed the finger at Iran on Twitter, and posted pictures of smoke rising from the attack.

__label__politics (CNN) US intelligence and military targeting experts have drawn up a preliminary list of Syrian chemical weapons facilities that could be struck if President Donald Trump were to order a new round of airstrikes in the country, multiple US officials tell CNN.

A decision to take action has not been made, but one administration official with direct knowledge of the current situation told CNN the military "could respond very quickly" if Syria launched a chemical weapons attack, and the initial targeting data assembled would give the Pentagon a head start if the President decides to take action.

US officials stress they are worried that an impending Assad regime assault on the rebel stronghold of Idlib could involve the use of chemical weapons if the rebels are able to slow regime advances. The regime has moved armed helicopters closer to Idlib in the last few weeks, according to two defense officials. The US is concerned they could eventually be used to launch another chemical attack using chlorine-filled barrel bombs, though they are readily available for a conventional assault.

Officials stress they are also worried that an assault on the city using conventional weapons could leave thousands dead and deepen the humanitarian crisis along the Syria-Turkey border.

Diplomatic tensions rising

Diplomatic tensions with Russia are also rising over Idlib. On Friday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Russia's foreign minister on Twitter: "Sergey Lavrov is defending Syrian and Russian assault on Idlib. The Russians and Assad agreed not to permit this. The U.S sees this as an escalation of an already dangerous conflict."

Sergey Lavrov is defending Syrian and Russian assault on #Idlib. The Russians and Assad agreed not to permit this. The U.S sees this as an escalation of an already dangerous conflict. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) August 31, 2018

On Thursday, Lavrov told Western nations not to "play with fire" over Idlib.

"It's well known that the progress of Syrian resolution, humanitarian solutions and fight against terrorism is not to everyone's liking," Lavrov said, adding that the White Helmets, a group of unarmed volunteer rescue workers, were preparing to stage a chemical strike to blame on the Syrian government as a pretext for military action.

"Another such provocation is being prepared in order to hinder the anti-terroristic operation in Idlib, and we, having our facts on the table, through our Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry clearly and firmly warned our Western partners -- don't play with fire," Lavrov said.

On Friday, the Pentagon responded, "Russia has recently launched a concentrated disinformation campaign to discredit the United States and international partners and allies... Specifically, Russia has suggested that as a pretext for United States strikes against the Assad regime, humanitarian organizations in Syria were planning a chemical weapon attack. This is absurd," Pentagon spokesperson, Cmdr. Sean Robertson said.

"That Russia is seeking to plant false lies about chemical weapons use suggests that Moscow is seeking to deflect from its own culpability when these heinous weapons are used. Russia's efforts to obscure the truth only underscore its years-long role in abetting the murder and mayhem conducted by the Assad regime," Robertson added.

Pentagon monitoring Russian activity in Mediterranean

The Pentagon is also closely watching Russian military maneuvers in the eastern Mediterranean. The Russian Ministry of Defense says 26 warships and more than 30 combat aircraft will be part of what the Russians say will be large scale exercises the area.

A US official with direct knowledge of the latest assessments tells CNN the US believes the Russians may have engaged in the buildup of naval warships to be ready for what they believe might be US strikes in response to the Assad regime using chemical weapons.

By having so many ships there, the Russians can attempt to use their shipborne radars to blanket that area and "see" any potential US Tomahawk missiles coming, the official says. One scenario the US is considering is that Russian shipborne radars could then cue Russian S-400 class anti-air systems on the ground in Syria and try to shoot US missiles down.

This would give the Russians a better chance of shooting down US missiles than in April 2018 when Russia was unsuccessful after the US, UK and France launched strikes against targets at three sites after an alleged chemical weapons attack on civilians in the Damascus enclave of Douma.

The US intelligence community has a very good understanding of what the Russians are trying to do with this seaborne strategy, officials tell CNN. It is also well known that the US military could use jamming and electronic warfare countermeasures against any Russian military efforts. In the April strikes against Syrian chemical targets, US and allied ships and aircraft fired from not only the Mediterranean but the Red Sea and North Arabian Gulf to avoid Russian detection.

The State Department has shared concerns about "any kind of escalation" of violence in Idlib with the Russian government, according to State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert. "We have shared the concerns that we have about any potential offensive taking place, we have shared those concerns with the Russian government at many levels," she said Wednesday.

As US intelligence continues to look at Russian military strategy and motivations, the official also points out the Russian naval presence contradicts all of Moscow's public statements about the situation. The US views this move by the Russian as evidence they are indeed aware the regime would be the one responsible if chemical weapons are used the official says.

The US has said they will hold the Assad regime accountable if chemical weapons are used in an attempt to retake Idlib, according to an NSC official. National security adviser John Bolton also issued a public warning, saying in Israel last week: "Just so that there is no confusion here, if the Syrian regime uses chemical weapons, we will respond very strongly. And they really ought to think about this a long time before they come to any decision because there is no ambiguity in the US position on this point."
__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump assembled a cadre of advisers in the Oval Office in January to discuss the FBI's crumbling and outdated headquarters. His FBI head, chief of staff and budget director, and the government's head of property management had just huddled and decided to rebuild -- instead of relocating or renovating -- the bureau's central offices.

Three months later, one of the meetings' attendees avoided telling Congress about Trump's involvement, the inspector general for the General Services Administration concluded Monday. GSA Administrator Emily Murphy's answers were "incomplete" and may have been misleading, according to the IG report.

The investigation had been requested by Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who asked for a look into "the agency's abrupt decision to abandon longstanding plans" to relocate the FBI headquarters.

"Murphy told us that she believed her answers to Representative Quigley were truthful. We agree that her responses were literally true," the report reads. "However ... her testimony was incomplete and may have left the misleading impression that she had no discussions with the President or senior White House officials in the decision-making process about the project."

A spokeswoman for the GSA focused on the first, rather than second, part of the inspector general's conclusions.

__label__world (CNN) The European Union is to propose ending twice-yearly clock changes after a large-scale public survey, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Friday.

According to Juncker, more than 80% of EU citizens want to abolish daylight saving time and instead remain on the time used during summer instead.

At the moment, each EU member state puts clocks forward one hour on the last Sunday of March and back again on the last Sunday in October.

"This debate about summertime, wintertime has been around for many years here," Juncker told German broadcaster ZDF.

"Many people are contributing to this debate. We did a survey, a public survey. Millions responded and think that in the future we should have summertime all year round. So that's what will happen."

__label__world (CNN) Hardline Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini is refusing to give permission to an Italian Coast Guard ship to disembark 177 people it rescued off the island of Lampedusa last week.

Migrants aboard the Ubaldo Diciotti, which docked in Catania, Sicily, after being forced to remain at sea for five days, will not be allowed off the ship until Italy receives assurances they will be relocated elsewhere in Europe, Salvini said.

The Coast Guard ship picked up 190 migrants on August 15 from an overcrowded boat 17 miles off Lampedusa after they were refused entry to Malta.

Transport Minister Danio Toninelli tweeted on Saturday, "Diciotti shows that Italy never pulls back when it comes to saving human lives. Malta's behavior is once again unspeakable/deplorable and deserving of sanctions."

Thirteen of them were taken to Lampedusa because of serious medical conditions, Coast Guard Lt. Floriana Segreto told CNN, but the remaining 177 were left in international waters. The majority of migrants are from Eritrea, with some people from Bangladesh, Syria and Egypt, the Coast Guard said.

__label__world (CNN) Australian advocates and opposition politicians are campaigning to free 119 children from forced detention on a tiny Pacific Island, amid warnings that the health of several young refugees is quickly deteriorating.

One 12-year-old boy, detained on Nauru under the Australian government's strict border policies, is seriously ill after refusing to eat for at least two weeks and needs to be transferred to the mainland for treatment, doctors say.

Doctors for Refugees President Barri Phatarfod told CNN the 12-year-old boy was one of several young children on Nauru whose health was progressively deteriorating.

"We can only assume (he has) depression because of his progressive withdrawal from different aspects of life ... We know he refuses to eat and refuses to drink," Phatarfod said.

There are 119 children still living on Nauru after being transferred there under Australia's immigration policy, which bans asylum seekers who arrive by boat from being settled on the mainland.

__label__world CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota grills former GOP Sen. Rick Santorum on President Donald Trump's relationship with the media in the aftermath of the summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
__label__world (CNN) Shelling hits the airport. Hospitals get caught in the crossfire. Migrants huddle in detention facilities between warring militias. And standoffs between factions with impenetrable grudges hold, making a resolution seem beyond distant.

This has been much of Libya's curse since the 2011 unseating of Moammar Gadhafi, but the past week has been a particularly ghastly episode. Militias holding parts of the capital, Tripoli -- who are technically loyal to the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) -- have been attacked by another armed group known as the 7th Brigade, from Tarhouna, to the capital's southeast. All sides accuse the other of corruption, and maintain their grip will restore order.

A young Libyan man inspects the interior of a mosque in Benghazi on February 9, 2018, after it was hit in a twin bomb attack.

Yet the opposite is obviously proving the case. Militias have been fighting or squabbling, often at a slow-burn rate, for control of parts of the city for years. The distant thump of explosions or intermittent gunfire is far from abnormal across the city's skyline. But this uptick has led the GNA to denounce the fighting -- among militias that are technically loyal to it -- and declare a state of emergency.

Ongoing clashes have left at least 47 people dead and more than 140 wounded, a Libyan ambulance official told CNN. Prisoners broke out of a jail during the unrest on Sunday, with local media reporting 400 had escaped, although a GNA official claimed it was just dozens.

Yet this is a smaller part of the wider problem. Nationwide, Libya is split yet again. In the east, General Khalifa Haftar, who decades ago helped Gadhafi's original coup, has consolidated control around the city of Benghazi. Another militia, the Misrata Brigades, dominate a port to Benghazi's west.

__label__world Hong Kong (CNN) The trial of Chinese human rights activist Wu Gan, who was sentenced to eight years in prison on Christmas Day, has again shed light on China's practice of sentencing high-profile activists during the holiday period in order to avoid international scrutiny.

The week between Christmas and New Year is a dead zone for many international companies, including the media and diplomatic services, most of which are sparsely staffed during the holiday period. That can make it the ideal time to bury bad news, experts say.

This was on show Tuesday, when a court in the north eastern city of Tianjin declared Wu guilty of subversion after almost over two years in detention.

Wu Gan, also known as the Super Vulgar Butcher, seen behind bars at a police station in Nanchang city in eastern China's Jiangxi province in 2015.

Known by his online moniker "Super Vulgar Butcher," Wu was known for his brash, outspoken style , including protests and performances outside court houses. He often seemed oblivious, even scornful of state power, responding to criticism with profanities and defiance.

In 2008, he advocated for Deng Yujiao, a woman arrested for killing a local official who attempted to rape her. A court found her guilty but did not sentence her to prison amid a massive swell of public support for her, in part organized by Wu. Her case was later fictionalized in the Jia Zhangke movie " A Touch of Sin ."

He was one of hundreds of lawyers and activists swept up in the so-called 709 crackdown in July 2015 . During a period of less than a week, at least 146 lawyers and their families were detained in a nationwide swoop according to the China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group (CHRLCG), a Hong Kong-based monitoring organization.

Most were released after questioning, but several have been handed lengthy prison terms, including Jiang Tianyong, who was sentenced to two years in prison after a televised confession his supporters have said was forced.

Wu refused to cooperate with the authorities, which may be why his prison sentence was so severe, said Kit Chan, executive director of CHRLCG.

She said his sentencing appeared to have been timed so as to avoid "public attention especially from the diplomatic circle."

"This is quite a usual practice or tactic for the Chinese authorities, especially around important and long holidays for the international community," Chan added.

His may not be the last case before 2018 either. Qin Yongmin, a former member of the China Democracy Party swept up in the 709 arrests, is due to be sentenced on December 29, while many people are still on holiday, according to lawyer Xie Yanyi , who was himself detained in the crackdown.

Christmas trials

While the Chinese authorities deny timing cases in this fashion, Patrick Poon, a China researcher at Amnesty International, pointed to multiple historical examples which suggest otherwise.

In Wu's case, Poon said, there had been little movement for months, making it "simply incomprehensible why (it needed) to be announced this week unless there are political calculations to avoid attention."

"By trying to avoid scrutiny from the press and the international community, the Chinese government betrays the fact it knows well these sham trials cannot withstand scrutiny," he said.

Michael Caster, author of "The People's Republic of the Disappeared," said each Christmas "China can be expected to hold at least one show trial for a high-profile human rights defender."

He said the idea is to avoid media attention and to "limit the blowback from such political trials."

One of the most well-known examples is that of Liu Xiaobo, a pro-democracy activist later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison on Christmas Day, 2009 , over six months after he was first charged with "inciting subversion of state power."

Liu died this year , shortly after being released on heavily-guarded medical parole, eight years into his sentence. Requests from his family and supporters that he be allowed to seek treatment overseas were denied.

He was the first Nobel Peace laureate to die in state custody since Carl von Ossietzky in Nazi Germany in 1938, and his case brought considerable international criticism of Beijing, which has seen less scrutiny of its human rights records in recent years.

Two years before, on December 25, 2007, well-known AIDS and environmental activist Hu Jia was arrested at his home in Beijing. He was later sentenced to three and a half years in jail.

Chan said timing trials for Christmas may be starting to backfire, with much coverage of Wu's trial highlighting the fact it was scheduled for the holidays, though the trial itself was very sparsely attended according to reporters on the scene

"It might be (becoming) less effective because the tactic is well known," she said.

Nor did the trial's timing prevent diplomatic condemnation, the embassies of Germany and the United States issued a joint statement Wednesday calling on the Chinese authorities "to release Wu immediately" and "view lawyers and rights defenders as partners in strengthening Chinese society through development of the rule of law."

The Asahi Shimbun/Getty Images Firefighters rescue people who were buried in mud after an earthquake struck Japan's Hokkaido island on Thursday, September 6.

A magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido early on Thursday, September 6, causing landslides that buried a large number of homes at the foot of a ridge.

More than 150 people were injured by the quake, mostly in Sapporo, said Kazuya Isaki, an official with the Crisis Management Office of Hokkaido Prefecture Government. At least seven people were killed, and dozens of people are missing.
__label__world (CNN) A New Zealand journalist was released Tuesday after being detained in Nauru while covering the Pacific Islands Forum.

TVNZ correspondent Barbara Dreaver was interviewing a refugee when she was picked up by police and detained for several hours before being released, the broadcaster said

The tiny Pacific island of Nauru is home to one of Australia's controversial offshore detention centers, where asylum seekers, including children, who arrived in Australian waters by boat were sent five years ago for processing.

Many have become so desperate to get off the island that children as young as seven and 12 have been refusing food and water and attempting suicide, according to a recent report

New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Dreaver was believed to have breached the conditions of her visa, which restricted journalists to only reporting on the forum itself.

In a statement , Nauru's government said Dreaver "was not 'detained' by police as some reports have stated, but voluntarily accompanied them while they made further enquiries."

Nauru has made it increasingly difficult for international media to report on the refugees, whose arrival on the island was part of deal struck with the Australian government. It charges media a $5,800 nonrefundable visa fee per application, with no guarantee that any access will be granted.

The Nauru government statement said that Dreaver had had her accreditation revoked for breaching the terms of her visa, but was able to remain on Nauru. The statement denied claims that journalists had been prevented from reporting on refugees.

Dreaver told reporters she was interviewing a refugee, "which we've been told we could do so as long as we had their permission and it wasn't at a camp, it was outside a restaurant when police showed up and wanted to see my visa (and) said I was breaching my visa conditions so I was taken to the police station."

"As far as I'm concerned I was doing my job. However, I'm really grateful that I'm still able to report on the Pacific Forum Issues even though I can't use the media center or go to any of the press conferences, I can report on forum issues, and that to me is why we're here, so that is really important," she added.

Reporters with Australia's ABC were told not to bother applying for visas to cover the Pacific Islands Forum after officials in Nauru deemed their coverage biased against the island.

In a statement , Amnesty International's Minar Pimple said that move was a "clear attempt at suppressing critical coverage of Nauru's government and its inhumane treatment of refugees."

"The country's current arrangements with Australia on refugee policy are a matter of journalistic and public interest. Going to these lengths to keep certain media out of the country is both an arbitrary, unacceptable restriction of press freedom and a telling sign of the government's determination to keep the appalling situation of refugees in Nauru out of the news," Pimple said.

"Hosting a pan-regional event like the Pacific Islands Forum comes with the responsibility of opening yourself up to the region's media. The Nauru government must not dictate who should and shouldn't be attending, nor should it be issuing guidance on what journalists can and cannot report."

In a statement, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she was pleased Dreaver had been released.

"This government believes in freedom of the press, throughout the world, and of course that includes the entire pacific region," added Ardern, who is en route to Nauru for the forum. She said she would raise the issues with officials there.

This isn't the first time Dreaver has run into trouble with a Pacific Island government. In 2008 she was detained on arrival in Fiji to cover an ongoing dispute between the island's authorities and New Zealand. She was later deported and spent eight years blacklisted from covering the country

Refugees in dire straits

Official Australian statistics show that 219 people -- 182 men, 23 women and 14 children -- are in Immigration Detention Facilities (IDFs) on Nauru. This number does not account for hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers brought to the remote island by Australian Border Force who are no longer officially in custody but remain on the island.

A joint report released Monday by the Refugee Council of Australia and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said people send to Nauru are "among the most traumatized (experts) have seen, even more traumatised than those in war zones or in refugee camps around the world."

Refugee advocates are pushing for the issue to be put firmly on the agenda at the Pacific Island Forum, but tweets from the Nauru government on the weekend suggest that's not likely to happen.

Using the hashtag #FakeNews, the Republic of Nauru account said there was no detention center on Nauru and suggested children were being "manipulated into self-harm" by their families, supported by activists.
__label__world Washington (CNN) The attorney general for the nation's capital. The president of a Catholic college. Teachers at a celebrated Catholic elementary school. A former White House appointee on religious freedom. Even a popular priest in his own archdiocese.

It's not just how many people are asking Cardinal Donald Wuerl, one of the world's most powerful Catholics, to leave office. It's who.

Wuerl, archbishop of Washington, has spent more than 50 years climbing the ranks of the Catholic Church, building a reputation as a loyal churchman and fastidious teacher.

He is also known as a political moderate and a key ally of Pope Francis who sits on the Vatican committee that appoints bishops around the world and is one of only 10 American cardinals who could choose the next Pope.

But in the wake of a damning 900-page report by a grand jury in Pennsylvania and a letter from a former top Vatican official accusing Wuerl of covering up for his disgraced predecessor, the cardinal is facing increasing pressure to step down from his perch atop the church's hierarchy.

What's unusual -- and potentially problematic for Wuerl -- is that those calls are increasingly coming from Catholics who play prominent roles in civil and church life in Washington.

"As a Catholic, my personal opinion is that Cardinal Wuerl should step aside in light of the sex abuse allegations in the Pennsylvania report and increasing reports of more abuse survivors," said Karl Racine, Washington's attorney general.

Racine also told CNN that, while his office does not typically discuss "confidential enforcement activity," the attorney general is "reviewing the findings of the Pennsylvania attorney general's report and we will consider taking action if appropriate."

Patricia McGuire, president of Trinity Washington University, is the first Catholic college president to publicly call for Wuerl's ouster.

"I think Cardinal Wuerl is a good man, and I have enjoyed knowing him," said McGuire, who also sits on the board of Catholic Charities of Washington, the archdiocese's leading charity group.

"But at some point the leader in a crisis has to know when to stay and try to fix the situation, and when deciding to step aside is an act of accountability and atonement. I don't think Cardinal Wuerl is as culpable as some of his critics say, but at some point a leader has to step aside to let the healing process begin."

McGuire said her views are widely shared on Trinity Washington University's campus, which sits across the street from the US Conference of Catholic Bishops' headquarters in Washington.

On Tuesday, faculty from Holy Trinity School in Georgetown protested at a Mass for Catholic schools in Washington, as an "act of solidarity against the injustices condoned by Cardinal Wuerl."

In a public letter to the Vatican's US ambassador, Archbishop Christophe Pierre, Trinity teachers called for Wuerl's "immediate removal."

Jack Devlin, a schoolteacher who attended the protest, told CNN that Wuerl's record on clergy sexual abuse, as recounted in the Pennsylvania grand jury report, is mixed.

"However, for every good thing that Cardinal Wuerl did, there were enough negative things that he did that we find unforgivable."

But the Archdiocese of Washington has vigorously defended Wuerl, sending detailed explanations of his actions to area clergy and pushing back against accusations that he failed to deal adequately with pedophile priests while he was the bishop of Pittsburgh.

The archdiocese declined to make Wuerl available for comment. But Kim Viti Fiorentino, chancellor of the Archdiocese of Washington, called the demands for Wuerl's resignation "misguided and mistaken."

"If you look at his record on child protection, not only is he one of the leaders in this area and one of the historic pioneers really in this area, but he has spent his entire priesthood (and) his episcopacy dedicated to protecting children, and if people reflect on his full record and the facts, they will see that."

Fiorentino said Wuerl does not plan to resign.

"Obviously there's going to be disagreements in opinion, but I think there is a path for us to move forward together in a really positive way."

Archdiocesan officials also deny that Wuerl knew that his predecessor as archbishop, Theodore McCarrick, had been accused of sexually abusing seminarians in New Jersey before he came to DC. Those allegations resulted in at least two legal settlements, according to church officials.

The Pope forced McCarrick to resign from the College of Cardinals last month after those accusations, as well as church charges that he sexually abused a minor, came to light. McCarrick, 89, has not commented on the accusations that he abused seminarians and said he is innocent of the allegations that he abused a minor.

'You know where this is going'

Like all Catholic bishops, Wuerl technically resigned when he turned 75 two years ago. But the Pope hasn't accepted his resignation. Cardinals are often allowed to serve until they are 80, if they are in good health. An avid swimmer, Wuerl, 77, is fit and trim.

While Wuerl has publicly battled bishops who want to prohibit Catholic politicians from receiving Holy Communion if they support abortion rights, he has generally sidestepped the culture wars, as well as the globe-trotting and glad-handing that McCarrick enjoyed.

Instead, Wuerl is known as the consummate churchman, careful and polished, with rarely a stray hair or word.

Some Catholics say they cannot foresee Wuerl stepping down -- or the Pope accepting his resignation. At least, not in the immediate future.

"We have a mob mentality right now, where everyone is saying 'Off with all their heads!'" said the Rev. Lou Vallone, a parish priest who worked with the cardinal during Wuerl's 18-year tenure as bishop of Pittsburgh.

"Everyone is enraged. But would the next archbishop of Washington really be any more 'perfect' than Wuerl?"

But accountability, not perfection, is the question of this Catholic moment, said James Zogby, a prominent Washington Catholic.

Zogby, the founding president of the Arab-American Institute and a former member of the presidentially appointed US Commission of International Religious Freedom, said he was at Mass last Sunday when the priest began to talk about Wuerl.

"My wife nudged me and said, 'You know where this is going,'" Zogby recalled.

The priest, the Rev. Percival D'Silva, made national news in 2002 by being one of the few Catholic priests calling for the resignation of the late Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston after that city's clergy sex abuse scandal.

In his sermon last Sunday at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament, D'Silva called on his boss to step down. The priest, who has tussled with Wuerl before over parish assignments, shared a portion of his sermon with CNN:

"Cardinal Wuerl -- This is my request to you: In the name of Jesus Christ. In the name of and for the good of the Catholic Church. In the name of and for the good of all the abused. In the name of and for the good of all the priests -- Please resign. Please step down. We are all hurting. Your stepping down will be the first necessary step in the process of healing. The Church is much larger than one, individual bishop."

D'Silva received a standing ovation when his homily was finished, Zogby said.

"I looked at his record in Pittsburgh, and it is not a pretty one. I've seen the arguments (from the archdiocese) that he was not culpable. But culpability is widespread. You either knew about the accusations and were responsible, or you didn't know, and you are still responsible.

"I think he should resign. It would send the message that, 'We get it. We failed you. Please forgive us.'"

Like other Catholics calling for Wuerl's resignation, Zogby has signed a statement urging all 271 active bishops in the US to tender their resignations to the Pope in a symbolic act of penance.

'There was no conspiracy'

Vallone, the Pittsburgh priest, said Wuerl, early in his tenure as Bishop of Pittsburgh, made mistakes in his handling of clergy sexual abuse, but that the Pennsylvania grand jury report portrays him in an unfair light.

"The attorney general had an agenda and it's stated at the front of the report: to get 'look back' and 'window' legislation passed," Vallone said. Those legal changes could make it easier for abuse survivors to sue their abusers.

To do that, the grand jury had to make the case that such laws are warranted because church cover-ups essentially allowed the current statute of limitations to play out, said Vallone.

As an expert in church law, the priest said he consulted closely with church lawyers during Wuerl's tenure in Pittsburgh, which began in 1989.

"I can state pretty categorically that, from 1989, there were no deliberate cover-ups. Did they make mistakes? Yeah. But it was due to stupidity, incompetence and lack of due diligence. But there was no conspiracy. We did things in the light of the times."

Vallone compared the church's response to pedophile priests to construction companies who once thought asbestos was safe. Once the psychological depth and possible incurability of pedophilia became more widely known, Wuerl took appropriate action, according to Vallone and the Archdiocese of Washington.

Some Pittsburgh priests complained that Wuerl moved too quickly to remove accused priests, without providing them with lawyers or allowing them to plead innocence.

"We felt that he was too draconian," Vallone said. "He was throwing priests under the bus. The priests in Pittsburgh do not believe the grand jury report is accurate with regard to Cardinal Wuerl's tenure here."

Joseph Cordes, a professor of economics at George Washington University, said he's willing to concede that Wuerl "got religion" on clergy abuse and adopted more stringent policies.

"But I don't think that absolves him. I think it would be an important gesture for him to resign right now. In the Navy, if you are captain of a ship and it runs aground, you are done, even if it's not your fault."

Dawn Eden Goldstein, an assistant professor at Holy Apostles College and Seminary in Connecticut who lives in Washington (she teaches her courses online), said some of the calls for Wuerl to resign are coming from conservatives who want to take down one of Pope Francis' top allies.

"There is an enormous amount of prejudice against Wuerl from people who are prejudiced against Francis."

But the people calling for Wuerl's removal in Washington are also a mix of liberal and conservative, young and old, men and women. Goldstein counts herself among them.

"It's a shame that these things get politicized," she said, "because abuse is not a liberal or a conservative issue, and it is unfair to victims to politicize it."
__label__world (CNN) Donald Trump may have got off to a rocky start with Australia when he became president last year, but his administration is determined to put it behind them this week when Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull visits the US.

Trump and Turnbull's first official interaction was a spiky phone call shortly after the President's inauguration, which the US leader described at the time as his "most unpleasant call all day."

However, Turnbull's visit has become a significant one for the United States -- as a multi-billion dollar investor and one of America's closet allies in a region they're rapidly losing to an increasingly assertive China, Australia is more important to the United States now than ever before.

"President Trump hasn't formed that many really close relationships with foreign heads of government ... in fact, he's alienated a number of them," Michael Fullilove, executive director at Sydney's Lowy Institute told CNN.

"For (the White House, this visit's) about showing that they've put that phone call behind them entirely ... and they've struck up a good relationship with the leader of a very reliable US ally."

"US and Australia pulling together and the US really appreciating Australia's role in the region will be the story of this visit," Jared Mondschein, Research Fellow at Sydney's United States Studies Center told CNN.

Turnbull, Trump 'share a common language'

But before he left for Washington, Turnbull made it clear he was not going to treat Australia's largest trading partner China as a military threat.

US President Donald Trump listens to Australia Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the ASEAN Summit in Manila on November 13.

"China's rise has been of enormous value to the region, there's hundreds of millions of people who have been lifted out of poverty. We don't see the region through what is frankly an out-of-date Cold War prism," he told CNN-affiliate Sky News.

"Neither, by the way, does Donald Trump."

Despite their shaky start and the processing of the US-Australia refugee deal which Trump loudly denounced, Australian officials said the two leaders now have a firm bond.

JUST WATCHED Australian PM mocks Trump in leaked video Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Australian PM mocks Trump in leaked video 00:59

Australian ambassador to the United States Joe Hockey told CNN both leaders had put their first, tense phone call behind them.

"The Prime Minister and the President actually are quite close and they respect each other," he said.

"They share a common language in terms of transactional business language. Also they understand that much bigger than any minor difference they might have, the relationship is very good and they have spoken many times together since and I think they really enjoy each other's company."

Trump and Turnbull actually do have much in common. The Australian leader was a lawyer and wealthy investment banker before entering politics and speaks the language of international business like Trump.

Deals likely to be announced

Turnbull is leading an enormous delegation of Australian business leaders and politicians, keen to discuss future investment between the two countries, while the Australian leader himself has meetings scheduled to visit the Pentagon for discussions with high-level US military figures.

The trip will culminate in a conversation with Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, Turnbull's first White House visit during the Trump administration.

At Trump and Turnbull's last meeting in the US in May 2017, Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt publicly announced he would be investing $2 billion to create jobs in the US.

Given the size of the business delegation accompanying the Australian leader to the US in February, more deals are likely to be revealed during this trip, Mondschein said.

President Trump and Prime Minister Turnbull during their meeting in May 2017.

"We'll have another similar announceable where the US and Trump can tout some of the wins from this relationship," he said.

Aside from Australia and the US's highly publicized security ties, Australian investment in America totaled almost $500 billion in 2016 according to the United States Study Center.

"Australia and in particular Trump want to focus on the economic component of the relationship -- US being the largest investor in Australia and the US the largest recipient of Australia investment," Mondschein said.

There has also been suggestions Turnbull and Trump may discuss a large infrastructure investment scheme in the Asia region, or encourage the US leader to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement.

Turnbull played down any suggestion their opposing program, planned in conjunction with Japan and other countries, was a "rival" to China's ambitious regional plans

"We need trillions and trillions of dollars of additional infrastructure investment in the (Asia) region. We want to make sure, do everything we can to ensure that that infrastructure investment has the greatest economic benefit for the countries where it's invested and of course, that you get the widest pool of investors," he told CNN-affiliate Sky News.

But aside from the economic ties between the US and Australia, Turnbull said there would also be discussions between the two leaders on security matters, such as the North Korea crisis.

"We'll be spending a lot of time talking about that and our determination as part of the global community ... to bring the regime to its senses," he said.

__label__world (CNN) UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for an independent investigation into a Saudi-led coalition air strike in Yemen that killed dozens of children.

The airstrike on Thursday hit a bus carrying children from a summer camp in a busy market area in the northern Majz District, UN spokesman Farhan Haq said in a statement

Condemning the attack, Guterres called for "an independent and prompt investigation" into the incident, Haq said.

In the statement, Guterres added that all parties must "respect their obligations under international humanitarian law, in particular the fundamental rules of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack."

According to the area's Houthi-controlled Health Ministry, 50 people were killed and 77 injured in the strike. The International Committee for the Red Cross said a hospital it supports in northern Saada province had received 29 bodies of "mainly children" younger than 15, and 40 injured, including 30 children.

Footage from Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV appears to show a boy, carrying a UNICEF backpack, being treated for injuries.

Houthi media broadcast graphic footage appearing to show the bodies of children. CNN has not independently verified these images.

A video from Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV shows several boys who appear to have lost their limbs. Two or more wounded children are seen sharing a single hospital bed, and one child -- soaked in blood -- screams as he is being treated at a health center.

In another video, which appears to show the immediate aftermath of the strike, several children's bodies lie under a blown-up bus. Some boys are seen regaining consciousness, their faces bloodied and limbs charred.

The boy is treated in a hospital after the strike.

One boy, his face blackened by dust, is seen trying to hold his legs up, apparently unable to move. "My leg won't get up," he says.

The attack came a week after a Saudi-led airstrike hit a busy fish market and the entrance to the country's largest hospital, Al-Thawra, in the port city of Hodeidah, killing 55 civilians and wounding 170 others.

Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia has led a coalition of Gulf states against Houthi rebels in Northern Yemen, after the Iran-backed rebels drove out the US-backed and pro-Saudi government.

The war in Yemen is now the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 22 million people -- three-quarters of the population -- in desperate need of aid and protection, the UN says

After Thursday's strike, Guterres renewed his call for a negotiated political settlement ahead of consultations scheduled in Geneva in September.

Lise Grande, United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, urged all parties to come to the table.

"The UN is offering a way forward through a dialogue on peace. We hope that all belligerents get to the peace table and start negotiating an end to this terrible war," she said.

Saudi denies targeting children

Saudi Arabia denies targeting civilians and rejected a UN report last year that blacklisted the country for deaths and injuries to children in the Yemen war.

Earlier Thursday, the Saudi-led coalition defended the airstrike as a "legitimate military operation," and a retaliation to a Houthi ballistic missile that targeted the kingdom's Jizan province on Wednesday night, according to the country's official news agency. One person was killed in that attack, Saudi state media reported.

Col. Turki al-Malki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, said the airstrike that hit the bus was aimed at a "legitimate target."

"No, this is not children in the bus," he said. "We do have high standard measures for targeting (sic)."

It is high time for these relapsing tragedies to stop in #Yemen. No one should allow putting children in harm's way and making them pay such an unacceptable price. Proud of @ICRC_ye and #Yemeni health teams in Saada doing their utmost to save lives. https://t.co/Tx9WW3Y5Kg — Robert Mardini (@RMardiniICRC) August 9, 2018

Malki said those responsible for firing ballistic missiles and targeting civilians would "get what they deserve."

The United States called on the Saudi-led coalition to launch an investigation into Thursday's strike.

US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Washington did not have the "full details of what happened on the ground," but said "we're concerned about these reports."

"We call on the Saudi-led coalition to conduct ... an investigation," Nauert said.

The Pentagon, which provides support for the Saudi-led war, called on US allies to mitigate "noncombatant casualties."

"Our noncombat support focuses on improving coalition processes and procedures, especially regarding compliance with the law of armed conflict and best practices for reducing the risk of civilian casualties," it said in a statement.

(CNN) Dozens of children, many younger than 15, were killed in a Saudi-led coalition airstrike that hit a school bus in northern Yemen on Thursday, according to the Houthi-controlled Health Ministry.

The children were on a field trip when their bus was struck at a market, the first stop of the day; 50 were killed and 77 injured, according to the ministry.

Most of the children were inside the bus when the airstrike hit, according to a local medic, Yahya al-Hadi.

The International Committee for the Red Cross said a hospital it supports in Saada had received 29 bodies of "mainly children" younger than 15, and 40 injured, including 30 children.

"(The hospital) is very busy. They've been receiving wounded and dead since the morning and it is nonstop ," Red Cross head of communications and spokesperson Mirella Hodeib said.

__label__world Jerusalem (CNN) US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman was embroiled in controversy Tuesday after being photographed receiving an aerial image of Jerusalem that was edited to include an artist's impression of a Third Temple, instead of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock.

The photo -- showing Amb. Friedman receiving the poster-sized image -- was taken during a tour of Bnei Brak, an ultra-religious Jewish area near Tel Aviv, held by the Achiya organization, a non-profit group that provides support for children with learning disabilities.

The incident forced the US Embassy in Jerusalem to issue a swift response, insisting Amb. Friedman was "not aware of the image that was thrust in front of him when the photo was taken.

"He was deeply disappointed that anyone would take advantage of his visit to Bnei Brak to create controversy. The US policy is absolutely clear: We support the status quo at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount," the statement added.

__label__world (CNN) Almost 90 elephant carcasses have been found during a survey in northern Botswana, revealing "unprecedented" levels of poaching in the country, the conservation group carrying out the study has said.

Just nine carcasses were discovered in total during the last audit of the region in 2014, and Elephants Without Borders is expecting this year's number to rise further because the organization is only halfway through the study, which began on July 5 and is largely funded by Botswana's Department of Wildlife and National Parks.

"While we had elephant poaching in the country before this year, it certainly wasn't of the magnitude that we're seeing now. It's completely unprecedented," Mike Chase, director and founder of Elephants Without Borders, told CNN.

"We were always warned that the poaching that has happened in East Africa and parts of northern Mozambique may spread south. What I'm astounded by is the scale and the speed at which it has happened."

Thato Raphaka, Botswana permanent secretary of land management, water and sanitation services, said that 90 elephants were never killed in one incident, and that a recent survey conducted by Elephants Without Borders found 53 carcasses that had already been reported to the government.

And Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston, president of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, isn't alone. Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, another key papal ally embroiled in the sex abuse crisis, has also canceled his appearance at next week's World Meeting of Families, a spokesman told CNN.

Consider the litany of recent incidents in the Catholic Church:

• Catholic bishops have launched investigations into sexual misconduct in seminaries in Boston, Nebraska and Philadelphia.

• The former archbishop of Washington resigned from the College of Cardinals after accusations that he molested seminarians and an altar boy.

• A Catholic bishop in Australia was convicted by a civil court of covering up abuse, and the Vatican has accepted the resignations of six bishops from Latin America after church investigations.

• An Associated Press investigation found evidence that priests and bishops around the world have abused Catholic nuns and sisters for decades.

• Next week, the Pope plans to travel to Ireland, where the former president, in an interview with The Irish Times , recently accused a top Vatican official of pressuring her to "protect" incriminating church documents from civil authorities in 2003. The Vatican has declined to comment on the allegation.

But none of the above compares to the stomach-turning, nearly 900-page grand jury report unveiled Tuesday in Pennsylvania.

The report, two years in the making, revealed shocking accusations: More than 1,000 children had been abused by 300 Catholic "predator priests" in six Pennsylvania dioceses during the past 70 years.

The report also said some church leaders covered up the crimes, shuffling priests from rehab centers to parishes, giving no notice to parents or civil authorities.

The state's attorney general called it the largest investigation ever by a US government into the Catholic Church. The president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops called it a " moral catastrophe ."

"I know that many of you are asking," Cardinal Blase Cupich wrote to Catholics in his Chicago archdiocese Friday, "how could this be happening again?"

If the Catholic sexual abuse scandal that came to light in 2002 slowly unspooled through news reports, Pennsylvania's grand jury report landed like an atom bomb, dropping its online horrors all at once. With some redactions, the report was readily available for everyone to read and share: the accusations of sexual deviance, shameless lies and deceitful churchmen.

"What we have now is people freely expressing their outrage on Facebook and Twitter," said Greg Kandra, a Catholic deacon in Brooklyn, New York. "The anger is palpable. This is like 2002 on steroids."

The details in the grand jury report are so disturbing -- one section describes a gang of pedophile priests who marked their child victims with crucifixes -- that some Catholics said they now fear raising their children in the church.

Many are also calling for bishops and other church leaders to be finally held accountable.

All of the bishops and most of the priests named in the report escaped punishment.

They were allowed to resign or quietly retire. Some were given recommendations for other jobs, including one at Disney World. Because of extensive coverups, the statute of limitations had run out on most of the crimes, the grand jury said. Only two priests were charged with crimes as a result of the investigation.

"The bishops' first reaction was to say that things look bad, but they did all we could," said Paula Kane, chair of Catholic Studies at the University of Pittsburgh.

"But lay people aren't buying that. The trust between the church's hierarchy and the people in the pews has been destroyed."

This week, as the Catholic mood in the United States has shifted from shock and grief to outrage, an increasing number of Catholics are calling on the church to clean house, starting with the bishops.

Friday, Catholic theologians, scholars and lay leaders began circulating a petition urging all 271 active bishops in the United States to step down.

As of Saturday, it had more than 1,000 signatures, representing a small fraction of the 68.5 million Catholics in the United States.

"Today, we call on the Catholic Bishops of the United States to prayerfully and genuinely consider submitting to Pope Francis their collective resignation as a public act of repentance and lamentation before God and God's People," the petition said

Bishop-sized loophole

After the 2002 Catholic sexual abuse scandal, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops adopted new policies. They pledged to report priests accused of abuse promptly to police, include lay experts in abuse investigations and adopt "safe environment" training in their dioceses.

Catholic leaders say the policies have worked.

"By finding almost no cases after 2002, the grand jury's conclusions are consistent with previous studies showing that Catholic Church reforms in the United States drastically reduced the incidence of clergy child abuse," Greg Burke, director of the Vatican's press office, said Thursday.

Burke also called the accusations in the grand jury report "criminal and morally reprehensible."

But some Catholics say the bishops' policies have a bishop-sized loophole, as evidenced by the case of Archbishop Theodore McCarrick.

McCarrick, who resigned from the College of Cardinals on July 28, apparently rose to the top of the church's ranks even though there were persistent rumors about his behavior with young men, including seminarians in his dioceses. McCarrick has denied the accusation about the altar boy and has not commented on the other allegations.

Two New Jersey dioceses where he was a bishop -- Metuchen and Newark -- have acknowledged paying settlements to men who accused McCarrick of abuse. The dioceses have refused to divulge the years of the settlements.

Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, announced Thursday that he will ask the Vatican to conduct an "apostolic visitation," church-speak for an investigation, into McCarrick, and what church leaders knew about his behavior.

DiNardo also said the bishops' conference is working on a plan to make misconduct and abuse by bishops easier to report and resolve. Both of those steps would take approval from the Vatican. Under church law, only the Pope can discipline or remove bishops.

Some Catholics say they are wary of bishops trying to police each other, saying such a system could be rife with conflicts of interest.

"I'm not so sure it should be up to the bishops to make recommendations or suggest solutions," said Kurt Martens, a canon law expert at The Catholic University of America in Washington.

"The credibility of the bishops is not that high," Martens said, "and I am saying that charitably."

What comes next?

Next week, the Pope plans to travel to Ireland , a country that suffered through its own appalling clergy sex abuse scandal in 2009. He is widely expected to meet with victims, perhaps privately, and may also publicly address the Pennsylvania grand jury report in some way.

American Catholics are increasingly skeptical of how the Pope is handling sex abuse in the church, according to the Pew Research Center . Less than half say he is doing a "excellent" or even "good" job on the issue, according to a survey taken in January, before the most recent scandals.

Some say the recent scandals are cause for the church to rethink its stance on the all-male and mostly unmarried priesthood. (The Roman Catholic Church currently ordains married men in rare occasions.)

The Pope has said the "door is closed" on ordaining female priests, but has said he is open to discussing the possibility of married priests in places where there is a shortage of clergy.

But the meeting to discuss that possibility won't take place until October 2019. Many Catholics are looking for action now.

In May, all of Chile's 31 active bishops were called to Rome for an emergency summit after a Vatican investigator looked into a clergy sex abuse scandal in that country. All 31 offered their resignations , and the Vatican eventually accepted five of them.

Experts say it would be impractical for all 271 of the active bishops in the United States to travel to Rome and meet with the Pope, and even more impractical to ask all of them to resign, though Francis could summon just the former and current bishops from Pennsylvania.

It's also possible that the Vatican quickly greenlights the US bishops' proposals to provide for greater oversight of bishops, even though that idea is often unpopular in Rome. (A papal proposal in 2015 for a church tribunal to judge bishops was quietly scotched.)

For centuries, Catholic bishops have had near-total control in their dioceses, with little oversight from anyone save the Pope, said Kane, the Pittsburgh University scholar.

"That old model is still in place," she said.

But the pressure is building on the bishops to change quickly.

Cardinal DiNardo, the president of the US Catholic bishops' conference, said he plans to travel to Rome to present his plan and "urge further concrete steps based on them."

He and other Catholic leaders say they don't have much time to repair public trust in the church.

"The clock is ticking for all of us in church leadership," said Cardinal O'Malley of Boston, the Pope's top adviser on sexual abuse.

"Catholics have lost patience with us and civil society has lost confidence in us."

Meanwhile, officials in Pennsylvania said their investigation is not over. State Attorney General Josh Shapiro said his office's hotline and email accounts for abuse survivors have "lit up" with more than 150 calls since the grand jury report was published.

And some prominent Catholics, including Illinois State Supreme Court Justice Anne Burke, are calling for attorneys general in more states to follow Pennsylvania's lead.
__label__world In July, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro wrote a personal letter to Pope Francis , warning him that "a comprehensive investigation" by his office had found "widespread sexual abuse of children and a systemic coverup by leaders of the Catholic Church."

Shapiro says he never received a response.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court set a deadline. The grand jury report had to be released by Tuesday at 2 p.m.

The six Pennsylvania dioceses named in the scathing grand jury report even received advanced copies of the 800-page document in May, according to Crux News.

Before the report was published on Tuesday, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, one of the Pope's top allies and the former bishop of Pittsburgh, had a detailed website prepared to defend himself against charges that he shielded abusive priests. (The website was removed on Thursday after an outcry from Catholics.)

All of this means that idea that the Vatican was caught flat-footed by the explosive report or needs more time to process it is increasingly difficult to understand. So is the Pope's silence on the matter.

Are accusations that 1,000 children were abused at the hands of Catholic clergy not enough to warrant a comment from their Holy Father?

Apparently not.

"We have no comment at this time," Paloma Ovejero, deputy director of the Vatican's press office, said on Wednesday. On Thursday, the Vatican again declined to comment.

Meanwhile, in the United States and elsewhere, pressure continues to mount on Pope Francis to address a rapidly escalating crisis that has spread across several continents, from Australia to Latin America.

In the United States, both liberal and conservative Catholics displayed a rare unity in pressing the Pope to respond to the Pennsylvania grand jury report.

"The silence from the Vatican is disturbing," said Massimo Faggioli, a theology professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. "I don't think the Pope necessarily has to say something today. He needs time to understand the situation. But someone from the Vatican should say something."

Faggioli noted that Wednesday was a national holiday in Italy, and many church offices were closed. But he also noted that it was well-known that Pennsylvania's grand jury report, which was in the works since 2016, would be released on Tuesday.

"I don't think they understand in Rome that this is not just a continuation of the sexual abuse crisis in the United States," Faggioli said. "This is a whole different chapter. There should be people in Rome telling the Pope this information, but they are not, and that is one of the biggest problems in this pontificate -- and it's getting worse."

Matthew Schmitz, an editor at First Things, a conservative Catholic magazine, said, "Francis has been unfairly attacked at times for his response to clergy sexual abuse. But his response has been disappointing. I hope that enough pressure can be created that he does act to investigate these issues."

Earlier this month, Schmitz was one of several dozen young Catholics who wrote an open letter to Francis, telling him they are angry over yet another case of abuse: the allegations against former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, former archbishop of Washington and one of the most powerful figures in the American church.

McCarrick, who recently resigned from the church's College of Cardinals, has been accused of molesting young boys and seminarians -- accusations he denies.

Schmitz and other Catholics say that while many priests have been punished for abusing minors, the bishops who covered up the crimes have largely escaped punishment, a point echoed in Tuesday's report from the grand jury in Pennsylvania.

"Priests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing; they hid it all," the grand jury said. "For decades. Monsignors, auxiliary bishops, bishops, archbishops, cardinals have mostly been protected; many, including some named in this report, have been promoted."

What can the Pope do?

Under canon law, the rules that govern the Catholic Church, the Pope has the power to remove or otherwise punish bishops.

But canon law is vague about when, exactly, that should be done, church experts said. No concrete crimes or corresponding penalties are listed in canon law, said the Rev. Hans Zollner, a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors and a professor of psychology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.

What's more, there are some 5,100 bishops around the world, Zollner said, and it would be impractical to expect the Pope to personally monitor every one and investigate every accusation of abuse or negligence.

Other offices within the Vatican have the power to commence investigations, but it is unclear whether they have the power to discipline bishops, Zollner said.

"What is needed is a complete overhaul of that system," Zollner said, "at least in the penal part of the Code of Canon Law."

In response to the McCarrick scandal, top American bishops have proposed subjecting bishops and other high-ranking clergy to oversight from bishops or competent lay leaders.

On Thursday, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the bishops have begun to outline a plan that would ask the Vatican to launch a full investigation into McCarrick, make reporting of abuse and misconduct by bishops "easier" and advocate for "better procedures" to resolve complaints against bishops.

"The first criterion is genuine independence," DiNardo said. "Any mechanism for addressing any complaint against a bishop must be free from bias or undue influence by a bishop. Our structures must preclude bishops from deterring complaints against them, from hampering their investigation, or from skewing their resolution."

DiNardo also said that lay people -- not just church clerics -- should be given "substantial involvement."

"Whatever the details may turn out to be regarding Archbishop McCarrick or the many abuses in Pennsylvania (or anywhere else), we already know that one root cause is the failure of episcopal leadership."

Bishops have resigned over sexual abuse cover-ups before.

In the United States, three bishops resigned in 2015 after accusations that they covered up cases of clergy sexual abuse.

After an emergency summit in Rome this May, 31 bishops from Chile offered to resign , an unprecedented action in the modern church, according to a church spokesman. The Pope had called the country's bishops to Rome after he received a 2,300-page report detailing sexual abuses by priests in Chile. The Pope has accepted the resignations of five of the bishops.

After the Pennsylvania grand jury report, none of the bishops named in the report offered to resign. At least, not publicly.

'A playbook for concealing the truth'

Tuesday's grand jury report said internal documents from six Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania show that more than 300 "predator priests" have been credibly accused of sexually abusing more than 1,000 child victims.

The grand jury described the church's methods as "a playbook for concealing the truth" after FBI agents identified a series of practices they found in diocese files.

The grand jurors said that "almost every instance of abuse we found is too old to be prosecuted." But charges have been filed against two priests, one in Erie diocese and another in Greensburg diocese, who have been accused of abusing minors.

At a news conference announcing the report's release, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro called it the "largest, most comprehensive report into child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church ever produced in the United States."

Although the Vatican declined to comment, DiNardo and Bishop Timothy L. Doherty, chair of the bishops' Committee for the Protection of Children and Young People, issued a statement:

"The report of the Pennsylvania grand jury again illustrates the pain of those who have been victims of the crime of sexual abuse by individual members of our clergy, and by those who shielded abusers and so facilitated an evil that continued for years or even decades," they said.

"As a body of bishops, we are shamed by and sorry for the sins and omissions by Catholic priests and Catholic bishops."

A holy day of obligation

Greg Kandra, a Catholic deacon in Brooklyn, New York, said he awoke on Wednesday to countless fellow Catholics expressing outrage on social media about the Pennsylvania grand jury report.

The presence of social media is a key difference between now and 2002, when a wave of sexual abuse scandals rocked the Catholic Church, beginning in Boston and quickly spreading to dioceses across the United States.

"What we have now is people freely expressing their outrage on Facebook and Twitter," Kandra said, "and that is where this story is starting to take off. The anger is palpable. This is like 2002 on steroids."

Another difference between now and 2002, Kandra said, is the focus on bishops -- not just priests -- and the accusations that they covered up for abusive priests or even engaged in abuse themselves.

"There has to be some accountability for the people in upper management in the church," Kandra said. "That isn't really happening right now. Bishops need to be accountable not only to the Pope and to their fellow bishops, but also to the people they serve."

Wednesday marked the Feast of the Assumption in the Catholic Church, a holy day of obligation that recalls the Virgin Mary's ascent into heaven, and Kandra was one of about 500 Catholics who attended noon Mass at a church in Brooklyn. The priest who celebrated the Mass didn't mention the abuse scandal. At least, not directly, Kandra said.

"He preached about evil and turning to the Blessed Mother to protect us. But he didn't address the big news (about the grand jury report). Maybe he's waiting until Sunday."
__label__world (CNN) Here's a look at what you need to know about the Oslo Accords, a series of agreements between Israel and the Palestinians signed in the 1990s.

Oslo I is formally known as the Declaration of Principles (DOP). The pact established a timetable for the Middle East peace process. It planned for an interim Palestinian government in Gaza and Jericho in the West Bank.

The United States was not actively involved in the negotiations.

The meetings were carried out in secret over several months in 1992 and 1993.

Oslo II, officially called the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza, expanded on Oslo I. It included provisions for the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from six West Bank cities and about 450 towns. Additionally, the pact set a timetable for elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council.

__label__world (CNN) What began with a statement of concern over human rights has ballooned into the biggest diplomatic feud in years between Canada and Saudi Arabia.

In a tweet on Friday, the Canadian Foreign Ministry said it was "gravely concerned" by the arrest of Saudi activist Samar Badawi and other women's rights campaigners, and called for their release.

Since then, the Saudi government has responded with a steady string of retaliatory measures , expelling the Canadian ambassador from Riyadh and recalling the Saudi envoy to Ottawa, suspending Saudi state airline flights to Toronto, and ending thousands of Saudi scholarship programs in Canada.

Then on Tuesday, Saudi authorities announced they would halt all medical treatment programs in Canada and transfer Saudi patients to hospitals outside the country.

The Saudi foreign minister said "Canada has made a mistake and needs to fix it."

The kingdom also said it plans to freeze future trade relations between the two countries.

Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Saudi Arabia would not tolerate any foreign meddling in its internal affairs, and suggested his country would not be backing down anytime soon.

"Canada has made a mistake and needs to fix it," al-Jubeir said Wednesday. "The ball is in Canada's court."

Saudi Arabia's response has struck some observers as a disproportionate overreaction to a relatively routine criticism of the country's human rights record. US Senator Bernie Sanders described it as "outrageous" on Tuesday.

MBS is known for his aggressive reforms and muscular foreign policy.

Regional analysts, however, say the Saudi reaction is consistent with Mohammed bin Salman's heavy-handed -- and often thin-skinned -- approach to power since the 32-year-old took over as Crown Prince.

"Since Mohammed bin Salman has ascended to power, there's been an intensified repression of dissent," said Human Rights Watch Saudi Arabia researcher Hiba Zayadin. "What we're seeing now is that he doesn't want to be held accountable in any way, whether that's by the Saudis themselves or by the international community."

In the year since he was promoted to first-in-line to the throne, MBS, as he is known, has embarked on an aggressive mission to modernize Saudi Arabia and reassert the country on the international stage.

And while MBS has lifted the ban on women driving and opened the first new movie theater in the country in 35 years, Saudi authorities have been cracking down hard on (predominantly women) activists, arresting a number of campaigners this year.

While several Middle Eastern allies have backed up the Saudi response to Canada, the reaction from Western countries has been muted thus far.

"It's a little bit disappointing that no one feels they're in a position to come out and support the Canadians on issues that just a few years ago they probably would have been a lot more vocal on," said Peter Salisbury, a fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House.

Experts fear the spat could set a new tone for discussions about human rights among the international community. They warn that the Trump administration's downplaying of human rights in foreign policymaking will further enable authoritarian rulers to carry out abuses.

Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton pose with Samar Badawi as she receives the 2012 International Women of Courage Award.

"(Saudi Arabia's) actions are in many ways enabled by the Trump administration's shift of focus away from human rights by and large," said Brookings Institute fellow Hady Amr. "The President of the United States has expanded the boundaries of what is considered normal behavior. Because of that other countries are much freer to act within those boundaries."

On Tuesday, a State Department spokeswoman said that although "we have a regular dialogue with the government of Saudi Arabia on human rights and other issues," the US was encouraging Saudi Arabia and Canada to sort out their differences amongst themselves.

Samar Badawi, whose activist brother Raif has been behind bars since 2012 and is sentenced to receive 1,000 lashes, was arrested last week, rights groups said.

Raif Badawi's wife and children were granted asylum in Canada in 2015.
__label__world (CNN) Police surrounded a JetBlue plane at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport Tuesday after a false alarm about a hijack incident was sent.

JetBlue Flight 1623 was lined up on the taxiway at the airport waiting to depart when it "experienced a radio equipment problem," the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.

The plane, which was bound to Los Angeles, sent out a hijack code notifying air traffic control that there was a security threat onboard after controllers couldn't make contact with the pilot, according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the incident.

There is a special code pilots must select using the aircraft's transponder to indicate such an emergency, the law enforcement source said.

Alexa Curtis, a blogger who was aboard the flight, said she was terrified when she realized something wrong could be happening.

__label__world Kerry Brown is a professor of Chinese studies at King's College London and director of the Lau China Institute. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) Leaders in the West have been suspiciously quiet about the expected changes to the Chinese constitution that would remove the two-term limit on the presidency -- which would allow President Xi Jinping to rule the country unchallenged for decades to come. Why the silence?

Firstly, most countries that deal with China will have assumed that Xi was here to stay anyway.

They know China is a one-party state, and that the Communist Party holds sway over everything. So unilaterally changing the rules its gives itself would not harm anyone. Most international observers will have been baffled the restriction was ever there in the first place.

But there is also a more pragmatic reason for silence. For all the Western complaints about the parlous state of human rights, in their hearts they know they need a country which is stable and predictable -- even if it is a stable and predictable autocracy.

A China that contributed to uncertainty in a world where Donald Trump is US president, the UK is trying to leave the EU, where the Middle East looks like it is perpetually inflamed by unrest, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo seems to be slipping toward yet more civil war would be a truly scary place.

__label__world Athens, Greece (CNN) An Australian Instagram influencer who was found unconscious on a superyacht docked in Greece died by hanging, the coroner in the case told CNN on Tuesday.

Sinead McNamara, 20, regularly posted images of her travels to exotic locations, and said in a post earlier this month that she had been living and working on a boat "seeing all the world has to offer."

News reports and social media posts identified the boat as the Mayan Queen IV , a 93-meter long vessel which is reportedly owned by Mexican billionaire and mining magnate Alberto Baillères, but a PR firm for his company said it had no comment.

The PR company for Grupo Bal declined to confirm that the magnate owns the yacht, and said it had no comment on McNamara's death.

McNamara, whose Facebook page described her as hailing from Port Macquarie in the state of New South Wales, was found in critical condition Friday on board the yacht docked in the port of Argostoli on the island of Kefalonia, said the coast guard. She died while being airlifted to hospital.

__label__world (CNN) In Greek mythology, sirens use their enchanting voices to lure sailors to their death. In Lebanon, a group of modern-day sirens have decided not to sing sweetly like their namesakes. Instead they scream, growl and headbang -- but they, too, turn heads.

Slave to Sirens are defying gender norms as the first all-female metal band in the country, asserting their place not just in conservative Lebanese society but also in the male-dominated, global heavy metal scene.

The five-piece group, formed in 2016, fearlessly command stages that are usually monopolized by men. Their lyrics -- written in English to reach a wider audience -- express raw feelings and strong opinions on issues of social inequality, politics and freedom.

It's our right to be on stage and perform as all girls, why would we be less or different from guys?

In the title track of the band's self-produced debut EP, " Terminal Leeches ," lead vocalist Maya Khairallah sings: "They fill your head with lies. Ignorance, your ultimate demise." The lyrics of the closing track, "Congenital Evil," reinforce the message: "Why do you always have to obey? Zero degrees of empathy, forever coming your way."

Bassist Alma Doumani, 22, says that for her, the allure of heavy metal is its aggressive style. "It lets your anger out -- it lets you express your mind."

"It's our right to be on stage and perform as all girls, why would we be less or different from guys?" says Doumani. "It's not just guys who have talent."

Defying the norm

Lina Abirafeh, director of the Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World, says that in Lebanon, women are frequently objectified. "Ideas of what is feminine, acceptable, beautiful, sexy -- all of those descriptors for women -- are notoriously narrow," she says, adding that female Lebanese singers are often "overly sexualized, very feminine, very dolled up." She sees Slave to Sirens as "role models" for breaking that mold.

Change is not being championed at the political level, because women are not well represented -- they currently hold only 3.1% of parliamentary seats . Lebanon also ranks 143rd out of 153 countries in the Women, Peace and Security Index , an assessment of women's overall well-being within their communities and societies.

Metal in the Middle East

But in Lebanon, the metal scene is largely accepted and most people understand it to be a form of art, according to Elia Mssawir, who helps to organize the annual Beirut Metal Fest

Alma Doumani, the band's bassist.

He cites an incident when organizers of a metal event in the Lebanese mountains were investigated after villagers "didn't like what they saw," but says there have not been any attempts at censorship in the last five years.

While it's common for metal acts in the region to use music as a platform to express opinion on politics or religion, Mssawir notes that current Lebanese bands largely steer clear from that because they see metal as an "escape" from those everyday realities. Slave to Sirens are among the few that inject those topics into their music.

Beyond metal music

Abirafeh believes that Slave to Sirens' impact will transcend music. "You don't have to like metal to see that what these women are doing is powerful and courageous," she says. "It's about saying that we are going to defy all those rules and norms, and go out there and do what we love."

"Other girls can also feel like maybe they [want] to do something but they are ashamed or they don't have the guts," says Doumani. "Maybe if they see us, they will have the guts to do it."

"The initial response is positive - they plan to take part in this meeting. I hope it will be productive," he told reporters in the southern Russian city of Sochi.

Moscow has taken an increasingly active role in efforts to persuade the Taliban to enter into a political settlement with the US-backed Afghan government, with which it has been in a lengthy conflict with.

Last week, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani offered a month long ceasefire with the Taliban , as officials in Kabul and Washington push for an end to the war which has stretched on since the US invasion in 2001.

"We remain ready to support, facilitate, and participate in direct negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban. There are no obstacles to talks. It is time for peace," US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said after Ghani's comments.

__label__world Silmido Island, South Korea (CNN) They were supposed to be a top-secret assassination squad tasked with attacking the residence of North Korea's then-leader Kim Il Sung.

But South Korea's "Unit 684," created in 1968 following a brazen attack by North Korea on Seoul's presidential compound, proved anything but.

The experiment to create a crack team of would-be assassins ended in disaster. Seven lost their lives -- executed for desertion or criminal activity, and dying from fatigue during the arduous training on a remote island. The remaining 24 members turned on their military trainers, killing most of them in a bloody mutiny.

The bizarre and deadly events that unfolded on the island of Silmido were covered up until details were revealed by a South Korean Defense Ministry Truth Commission in 2006. They've also been the subject of a blockbuster movie.

The story resonates today as South Korea embarks on the creation of a new decapitation unit -- something it sees as a much-needed defense against its nuclear-armed neighbor.

"The message is if North Korea attacks South Korea with nuclear weapons, South Korea would go after Kim Jong Un and kill [him]," says professor Park Hwee-rhak at Kookmin University.

A view of the beach where Unit 684 recruits lived and trained for three years on Silmido until they staged a bloody mutiny on August 23, 1971 and killed 18 of their trainers.

How Unit 684 was formed

Initially, South Korea's intelligence agency planned to recruit convicted prisoners on death row. However, the 2006 Defense Ministry report notes that in the event, intelligence officers "recruited civilians and gave them the mission to 'assault Kim Il Sung's residence.'"

Yang Dong-soo, a former Unit 684 trainer, told CNN team members were recruited largely based on their physical appearance.

"Intelligence officers approached the men who looked like they might have played sports and had a strong physique and recruited them," he says.

"These people were either a shoeshine boy, a newspaper boy, a cinema worker or a bouncer."

A photo from 1970 shows Air Force Sergeant Yang Dong-soo standing in front of a skull and crossbones sign on the island of Silmido. Yang was assigned to train members of the assassination squad when he was 21 years old. He says the skull and cross bones were real human bones.

Yang was a 21-year old volunteer in the air force when he was deployed to the island of Silmido off the western coast of South Korea in 1970.

Today, the island is uninhabited. It is accessible by foot for several hours a day, when the tide drops opening up a sandbar to a nearby island.

A faded photo from 1970 shows Yang standing in uniform on Silmido in front of a tent and a wooden assassination squad sign decorated with a menacing skull and crossbones.

"They were real human bones," Yang says.

Yang says he was charged with teaching the recruits hand-to-hand fighting.

"I taught the recruits the skill they needed to survive. And the most important lesson was 'to live, you must kill,'" he recalls.

A sign on Silmido has a recreation of the infamous skull and crossbones that was erected at the original training grounds in the late 1960s.

On the island, both recruits and trainers were forbidden from communicating with the outside world. The training was relentless and brutal.

"In the middle of sea survival training, one recruit died of fatigue," Yang says.

In fact, from 1968 to 1971, seven of the unit's 31 members lost their lives. According to the Defense Ministry, two men were executed for desertion. Another man was executed for threatening a trainer. Three others were executed or died after an incident in which they escaped the island and raped a local woman.

Something snapped

Throughout their three years on the island, members of Unit 684 were never deployed to North Korea. On top of the executions, fatalities and isolation, basic promises made by recruiters were broken.

The 2006 Truth Commission concluded that after the first three months on Silmido, commanders stopped paying the trainees salaries and fed them poor quality food.

And then something snapped. On the morning of August 23, 1971, the assassins turned on their commanders.

Yang says he was preparing to go to the mainland that morning for a monthly supply run when he heard gunfire.

"At first I thought the North Korean special forces are here to take over this island," Yang says.

Then a recruit shot him in the neck. The bullet entered from the back next to the spine and passed through the left side of his neck. Now 68 years old, Yang shows the pale pink scars on his neck that still mark the bullet entry and exit wounds.

"When I woke up, I was bleeding from my neck and everywhere the trainers were being killed by the recruits or running away, or were being shot again by recruits who were making sure that they were dead," Yang recalls.

"It was chaos."

Yang says he dragged himself down to the dark, oyster-encrusted rocks that line the beach. Bleeding profusely, he hid under stones and prayed to God that his former students wouldn't find him.

Though they never found Yang, the members of Unit 684 killed 18 of their trainers on the island. And they weren't finished.

The assassins made their way to the mainland and then hijacked a bus to Seoul. There, they clashed with soldiers and police. Dozens of security forces and civilians were killed and wounded.

South Korean troops guard the bombed out remains for a bus hi-jacked by Unit 684 mutineers.

The battle ended when an explosion on the bus killed 20 of the mutineers. Four survived the blast. They were tried in secret, and all four were executed on March 10, 1972.

"After the execution, the bodies were not handed over to the families," the Defense Ministry wrote in 2006.

Cover-up

The Truth Commission stated that the air force commanders in charge of Unit 684 engaged in a cover-up, burning documents related to the deadly failure.

"The truth of the incident had been a closely kept secret," the commission concluded.

Nearly half a century after Unit 684 ended in bloody failure, there are signs the South Korean military is avoiding previous mistakes with its new assassination squad.

South Korean security forces carry one of the Unit 684 survivors in 1971. A 2006 Defense Ministry Truth Commision report revealed 20 mutineers were killed on board the bus. Four survivors were later executed.

Officials have provided few details about the new unit, which has been titled the "Special Task Brigade." Unlike its predecessor -- which was comprised entirely of civilian volunteers -- the contemporary force has been recruited from the military's highly trained special forces.

Defense Minister Song Young-moo told lawmakers last September that the new force would take approximately a year to put together. In December, South Korean military held a ceremony closed to the public to mark the creation of the decapitation unit.

A National Assembly officer told CNN that South Korean's Defense Ministry plans to inject 57.7 billion won ($50 million) in the next few years to equip the brigade with necessary weapons and ammunition.

The purchase list includes see-through-the-wall radars, "suicide" drones and grenade launchers, another parliamentary staff member confirmed.

Tourist attraction

Korean producers turned the story of what happened on Silmido it into a blockbuster movie that hit screens in 2003, reproducing the original barracks and training ground on the site of the original installation on the island.

The film also had flourishes that harked back to the World War II classic "The Dirty Dozen," with some of Unit 684's recruits described as criminals forced to join the government-run assassins squad.

The Defense Ministry Truth Commission report and Yang, the Unit 684 survivor, both insist criminals were not members of the organization. Despite the controversy, the movie sparked a national discussion about the Silmido affair.

Today, the local municipality has erected placards referring to the movie on Silmido. They show photos of the actors as well as Unit 684's infamous skull and crossbones sign.

An overgrown well and some foundations are all that remains of the original training ground, which was built on a hill overlooking the sea.

Yang eventually recovered from his injuries and spent more than 30 years teaching art in schools. He eventually published a memoir about Unit 684, and often speaks to church groups about how divine intervention saved him on the island.

He refuses to condemn anyone for the bloodshed.

"They (Unit 684's members) should not be branded as mutineers. They were victims. They were young men who were sacrificed," he says. "Trainers like me, we were also victims."
__label__world Beijing (CNN) A visit by Taiwan's President has left a popular bakery caught between two increasingly adversarial governments in Beijing and Taipei.

The Taiwanese chain, 85C, became an overnight pariah in mainland China after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen visited one of its stores in Los Angeles on Sunday during a stopover on her diplomatic trip to South America.

According to the company's website, 85C has almost 600 outlets in China.

The bakery's efforts to make peace failed to placate Beijing and have instead angered their customers in Taiwan, where some angry citizens have accused it of "kowtowing" to the Chinese government.

85C is just the latest business caught in the escalating political crossfire between Beijing and Taipei, which has swept up global car manufacturers and many international airlines.

__label__world (CNN) — Some people set records by jumping the highest or running the fastest.

But for Jessica Nabongo, a UN employee turned travel blogger, becoming the first black woman to visit every country on Earth isn't just about getting her name in a record book -- it's about paving the way for women and people of color to do the same.

Nabongo was born in Detroit to Ugandan parents and holds two passports.

Although she felt like she'd achieved "the American dream" by landing a six-figure job at a pharmaceutical company after college and buying her own place in the Motor City, the work didn't satisfy her.

She began renting out her condo to make money, then hit the road -- first, teaching English in Japan, then grad school at the London School of Economics, followed by a job at the United Nations that took her to Benin and then Italy. But that wasn't enough to sate the travel bug.

But simply being able to afford a ticket doesn't mean that travel is easy or seamless.

Nabongo's experiences traveling the world undercut many of the exhortations travel brands have to " live like a local ," being able to seamlessly blend in anywhere simply by changing clothes or ordering coffee a certain way.

Often, as the only person of color in a crowd, she stood out whether she wanted to or not. Nabongo also has dark skin and shaves her head.

To date, there are about 150 known people who have been to every country, the majority of whom are white men traveling on European passports -- the ones who have the option to "blend in" in more places.

As of April 2018, there were 193 recognized countries in the United Nations, plus two with "non-observer status."

Since she began her project in earnest in 2016, Nabongo has been to 109 of them. Her goal is to reach 172 by the end of 2018, and the remaining countries by summer 2019.

North Korea and Iran, which often prove challenging for US travelers, are two where she plans to use her Ugandan passport. So far, her passports have stamps from places as far-flung as Nigeria, Cuba, Turkey and Laos.

Nabongo supports her travel habit a few ways. She founded a company called Jet Black , which organizes custom itineraries for small group trips in Africa, plus sells travel gear like branded T-shirts and passport covers.

As an influencer, she works with hotel and hospitality brands, some of whom offer up free stays in exchange for social media posts. She also accepts donations on a GoFundMe page.

"Navigating the world as a woman can be very difficult," Nabongo told CNN Travel. "I've had a pretty wide range of experiences. I've been accused of being a prostitute. I've had men chase me before. I've been assaulted on the street."

In one particularly horrible incident, a driver/fixer Nabongo had been working with and had grown to trust invited her to an "Easter orgy" just before he was due to pick her up to go to the airport. "That is something a man will never have to deal with."

And despite being a self-identified African, that didn't mean everything was smooth sailing when Nabongo traveled around Africa.

A few times, she watched in frustration as she was forced to wait behind white tourists or forced to pay bribes in order to cross borders that should have been open to her.

"The discrimination that I faced in South Africa was ridiculous. Not only from white South Africans, which many would expect, but also from black South Africans," she says.

However, some countries were better than others: "Senegal, it's amazing. You don't see them privileging white people over Africans. They treat everyone the same. Same in Ghana."

Adding to the challenge of seeing the world is the fact that Nabongo often travels solo. She generally eschews Airbnbs for hotels, where she can count on a 24-hour front desk to keep her feeling secure. She prefers to bring friends along to share the experience when possible.

Sometimes, though, the tables turn and Nabongo finds herself abroad speaking on behalf of Americans. This is particularly likely in countries that have warned their citizens against traveling to the United States or have concerns about gun violence.

"While I've been abroad, I've had people ask me about how safe is the US, especially for people of color," Nabongo says.

"And you know, I have to tell them, 'Yes, there is a high risk for you in particular in urban areas. But then also in rural areas because you're a minority.' It's a very strange and difficult thing to navigate."

Still, comments and questions like those only emphasize the importance of Nabongo's work.

While she does not identify as an activist, sometimes her mere presence is enough to make a difference or cause a person to see things differently. This is a common sentiment echoed by many women of color: Simply being who you are is a statement.

Whether counseling a person of color who's afraid to travel or a local who thinks it's okay to try and touch her head without asking, Nabongo serves a cultural ambassador role that may not be visible behind those colorful shots she posts on Instagram

Speaking of Instagram, Nabongo has some words of caution for travelers who use African people as objects, props or backdrops in their photos, something she encounters way too often online.

"Instagram is great. I love it. It's obviously given me a platform so that I can educate people about different places in the world," she says.

"But it's also a very dangerous and disgusting place as well because a lot of people want a bigger following. They want the likes. They want pictures that go viral. So they're willing to use anybody and anything."

"We cannot negate the optics of whiteness in Africa. We can't," she says.

Ultimately, Nabongo's quest isn't just about crossing countries off a list.

It's about changing the perception of female travelers, of travelers of color and of anyone who doesn't have the option of passing for a local in a given community.
__label__world Dublin, Ireland (CNN) A former Vatican ambassador to Washington has called for Pope Francis to resign over his handling of sexual abuse allegations against a prominent cardinal in 2013.

In a statement seen by CNN Sunday, former Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano said he told the Pope about allegations of sexual abuse against high-profile American Cardinal Theodore McCarrick five years ago, but that the Pontiff did nothing about it.

"He [Pope Francis] knew from at least June 23, 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator," Vigano said in the lengthy statement dated August 22, adding, "although he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered him to the bitter end."

"It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action [regarding McCarrick] to save his image in the media," Vigano continued.

A source close to Vigano confirmed the letter is genuine. CNN has so far not received a response from the Vatican.

__label__world (CNN) The author of the hit novel "Crazy Rich Asians" is wanted in his birth country of Singapore for failing to register for national service, according to the country's Ministry of Defense.

Kevin Kwan, whose book inspired the breakout movie of the same name, could face up to three years imprisonment for failing to register for the service.

"Mr Kevin Kwan failed to register for National Service (NS) in 1990, despite notices and letters sent to his overseas address. He also stayed overseas without a valid exit permit. Mr Kwan is therefore wanted for defaulting on his NS obligations," the Ministry statement, emailed to CNN, states.

The cast of "Crazy Rich Asians" pose alongside author Kevin Kwan (far right) at the movie's premiere in Hollywood.

"In 1994, his application and subsequent appeal to renounce his Singapore citizenship without serving NS were rejected. Mr Kwan has committed offenses under the Enlistment Act, and is liable to a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to three years upon conviction."

Despite widespread interest in the film, much of which is set in the city state, Kwan didn't make an appearance at a red carpet event for the movie in Singapore, unlike the majority of the Singaporean members of the cast.

__label__world (CNN) If you traveled on Route 66 in the western US this summer, there's a chance you caught a glimpse of a man dancing along in a neon tutu and headband, waving to passersby.

That was Ben Hammond, the self-proclaimed "Planet Prancer," who has made it his mission to boogie every step from California to New York City.

"In terms of why dancing -- or prancing ... I felt it was a really good symbol of the freedom that I have," 40-year-old Hammond told CNN. "When I'm dancing and I'm dancing free, I feel free, so why not take that and take that message out into the world?"

Four-year mission

Hammond began his journey in April after saving enough money to travel from his home in London to the United States, and securing lodging with charitable hosts or discounted motels.

The full-time teacher and lecturer can only progress during his vacation time, making this a long-term endurance dancing feat.

The dedicated Brit finished more than 1,200 kilometers on the first chunk of his trip before returning back to London last week.

"Next summer the most I can hope to achieve is to get halfway through the United States, so in all honesty it's going to take me about four years to get from beginning to end. But I'm committed to this and I'm going to give it a go, all I've got," Hammond said. Read:

Along the way, he has found that people are more often curious than cautious of his eccentric mission, some sharing their own stories about how they've been impacted by human trafficking.

"Lots of people said be safe, be safe, (there are) lots of people out there that aren't going to support you and things," said Hammond. "But I've actually seen none of that -- everyone has been so friendly and so warm and so supportive that I'm really excited to come back and take my next dancing steps through America!"

40 million people in slavery

Grooving to music he blasts from a small stereo and carrying his supplies in a flag-adorned buggy that he named "Barbara," Hammond logs anywhere from 14 to 60 kilometers per day, depending on terrain.

In other words, he often "dances" the length of a standard marathon each day, for weeks, tracking his progress on his website

But this isn't his first cross-country dancing trek. In 2012 and 2013, he danced from the top to the bottom of Great Britain.

"After that, I asked myself, where do I take it next? And I thought why not take this message of freedom to the land of the free? So America it is," he said.

Hammond has raised more than $6,000 for Anti-Slavery International, quickly closing in on his goal.

In a statement, an Anti-Slavery International spokesperson said of Hammond: "With an estimated 40 million people in slavery across the world, we urgently need to build a modern abolition movement that will end it for good. With supporters like Ben, we are confident that we will succeed sooner rather than later."

For the Planet Prancer, his challenge has another mission as well. "It's to make a difference to individual people's lives who are trapped in slavery, but also to the people I meet along the way," he said.

"I want to show them that life doesn't have to be lived in a box; you can do these kind of crazy, slightly wacky things. It's OK, and it actually really enriches life to have a go at the challenges that are out there."

According to local media reports, police fired teargas and shots in the air to break up crowds protesting over the arrest of MP Robert Kyagulanyi, who is also a musician, who goes by the stage name of Bobi Wine.

Kyagulanyi has suffered multiple injuries and fractures since his arrest last week, his lawyer Erias Lukwago told CNN.

One person died after a police officer fired on a minibus. Five others were injured during the shooting, police spokesman Emillian Kayima said.

__label__world (CNN) Hundreds of thousands of additional vaccines intended for children have been found to be faulty, the Chinese government announced Wednesday, raising the number of known defective vaccines in the country to almost one million.

In a statement, China's State Council announced a second batch of diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) vaccines, produced by Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology, had been discovered to be "substandard" -- 247,200 injections in total.

The vast majority had been sold to provincial authorities in Shandong, in China's northeast, and some had already been administered to children, the statement said. But it insisted that other than being ineffective they were not dangerous in any way.

"The National Health Commission and the State Drug Administration have planned revaccinations for the children who had been (injected) with the substandard DPT vaccines," the statement said.

In November, the government announced that another 253,338 DPT vaccines produced by the same company were defective, as well as more than 400,000 doses produced by a separate company, the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products.

Police identified the two women as 24-year-old Raisa Rinda Salma and 33-year-old Dessy Meyrisinta. Their last known address was given as the Flamingo Hotel in Ampang, Malaysia, a town on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur.

As the two women could not be contacted, the authorities are appealing to the public for information on their whereabouts.

Speaking to CNN, Selangor State Criminal Investigations Department chief Fadzil Ahmat wouldn't say whether the women were associates of two women who have been charged with killing Kim, only that they are being sought as witnesses.

Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong, nationals of Indonesia and Vietnam respectively, are currently on trial for allegedly murdering Kim last February by wiping his face with the highly lethal nerve agent VX at an airport in the Malaysian capital.

(CNN) Bishop John McCarthy of Austin will be laid to rest Friday. A larger-than-life, gregarious Irishman, McCarthy led the Catholic Diocese of Austin from 1986 until 2001, and was a priest for more than 60 years.

He was powerfully committed to civil rights (not always popular in the Texas in which he grew up), questioned the church's tradition of priestly celibacy, and advocated for a more inclusive and powerful role for women. The diocese thrived under his leadership. Enrollment in Catholic schools, membership in the church, baptisms, and conversions more than doubled, the diocese said.

I first met Bishop McCarthy when he was an auxiliary bishop in Houston and I was a teenager active in the Catholic Youth Organization (CYO). In the 90's, when he was Bishop of Austin and I was living there, we had regular lunches, where we talked about politics (which he loved), movies, books, and -- as we say in Texas -- life its ownself.

I remember one conversation in the mid 90's especially. A lawsuit had been filed in Dallas, alleging that a priest had molested children and the church had covered it up. It was one of the first such lawsuits in the country. I recall being shocked, and disbelieving that such a thing could happen. Not in the church that had given me a moral compass and spiritual sustenance; the institution that sponsored dances and retreats and even found a spot on the Holy Family CYO basketball team for a kid who was too short and too slow for the high school team.

__label__world Dublin, Ireland (CNN) Delivering Mass under stormy Dublin skies, Pope Francis gave an unplanned speech on abuse to hundreds of thousands of faithful in leafy Phoenix Park and asked for forgiveness.

Just 3 miles away, down the winding River Liffey, many of those gathered for an unprecedented protest in the Garden of Remembrance said the Pontiff's words failed to address their fury over a long list of church-related abuses in Ireland.

The Stand4Truth rally gathers outside a former Magdalene Laundry in Dublin as part of demonstrations against clerical abuse.

"I'm sure the Pope was sincere in his apology, but it needs to be followed up by action," said Jenny Moore-Mcgowan, 47, holding a sign that read: "Apologies are not enough."

"We can never, ever, ever have these abuses again in Ireland. The lives of people for generations were ruined, not just the people who were in the institutional schools, the Magdalene Laundries , the mother-and-baby homes, but their children and grandchildren. It ran right through this country like a virus."

The Pope's visit to Ireland came amid an intensifying outcry over a global clerical sex abuse crisis, following damning reports in the United States, Chile and Australia, detailing decades of institutional cover-ups. The revelations hung like a cloud over the trip, the first papal visit to the country since 1979, when Pope John Paul II was greeted here like a rock star.

In Temple Bar, a nightlife quarter packed with pubs, you wouldn't know the Pope was in town, save for a few fluttering Vatican flags and shuttered streets. At one of the few papal souvenir stands in the city center, Paul Preston said he was having trouble selling merchandise.

Paul Preston was dropping prices for Pope merchandise on Sunday, after making few sales.

"People aren't coming out to support the Pope in droves like they did in '79. The church's influence since then has gone kaput. People are disenchanted with all the controversies, all the sexual scandals."

Forgiveness, but no solutions

Nearly four decades after John Paul II's visit, Ireland is almost unrecognizable. It has broken from church teachings to legalize divorce, contraception, same-sex marriage, and just a few months ago, abortion. Leo Varadkar, the country's first openly gay Prime Minister, gave an impassioned speech Saturday calling on the Pope to use his "office and influence" to bring about justice, truth and healing for victims and survivors.

His forceful words were what many in Ireland had hoped to hear from Pope Francis himself during Mass.

"The Pope needs to take responsibility for the actions of his clergy," said Aoibhin Meghen, a 19-year-old from the Dublin suburb of Dalkey, who attended Sunday's Mass with her mother. "Although he hopefully hasn't had any involvement in the abuse, he is the figurehead for the church, so it's his responsibility to promise action and retribution for the people who have been wronged."

Just hours before celebrating Mass, Pope Francis faced calls for his resignation from the former Vatican ambassador to Washington, who said the Pontiff did nothing about allegations of sexual abuse against the prominent Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, despite knowing about them in 2013.

Later, speaking to the press on his flight back to Italy from Ireland, Pope Francis said, "I will not say a single word on this," although he added that after some time passes, "I may speak."

The Pope told reporters he believes the statement from former Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano speaks for itself. "I read the statement this morning, and I must tell you sincerely ... read the statement carefully and make your own judgment," the Pope said.

In his homily on Sunday, the Pope acknowledged "abuses of power and conscience" in Ireland, and asked for forgiveness for all the times the church did not provide survivors with compassion, justice, truth, or "concrete actions."

But still the Pontiff didn't offer any specific solutions. And critics say he hasn't gone far enough in articulating concrete steps to stop and punish abuses.

"Speak the truth. That's what we're asking for," Hayley Brabazon, a 21-year-old from Dublin, said, calling on the church to come forward with the names of all priests disciplined over abuse. "It's very simple, it all needs to come out. They need to speak the truth -- the bishops, the priests, the Pope himself, who are protecting these monsters, they need to speak up. And it's about time the Irish people stood up to them."

A different Ireland

The same refrain was echoed by many protesters at the "Stand for Truth" rally, organized by Colm O'Gorman, a survivor of abuse who is now executive director of Amnesty International Ireland. About 5,000 people, including women's rights groups, LGBTQ+ organizations, and abuse survivors, came out to stand in solidarity with those who have suffered under Catholic-run institutions in Ireland.

Ailbhe O'Rourke and Fionn Dally hold a sign reading: "The Pope is protecting paedophiles" in protest over clerical sex abuse.

Ailbhe O'Rourke, 33, and Fionn Dally, 33, hung toward the back of the crowd holding a sign that read: "The Pope is protecting paedophiles," written on the back of a repurposed sign from demonstrations to repeal the Eighth Amendment, a ban on abortion that was overturned in a referendum earlier this year.

"We're hoping for a hat-trick. We passed marriage equality, legalized abortion, and now we're hoping for separation of church and state," Dally said, referencing the church's power over the education system; approximately 90% of primary schools in Ireland have a Catholic ethos.

Organizers estimated 5,000 people gathered for the Stand for Truth protest.

"The Ireland that welcomed John Paul in 1979 is not the same Ireland anymore. It's completely changed. There are a lot of hurt people in this country," O'Rourke said, wiping away tears. "After the changes we've seen bring so much joy, to have the Pope come here is just a slap in the face."

As O'Rourke spoke, on stage, Belfast singer Brian Kennedy performed a rendition of a John Lennon classic with a new verse added: "Imagine there's no pedophiles." In a moment of levity, the crowd, which had been largely somber, broke into laughter and cheered, waving their placards aloft.
__label__world (CNN) Around 2,500 people gathered in the eastern German city of Koethen Sunday for a right-wing demonstration after two Afghan men were arrested for assaulting a 22-year-old man who later died, according to police.

The "funeral march," which drew far-right groups from Goettingen, 110 miles west of Koethen, and from Greiz, a two-hour drive to the south, bore strong echoes of the demonstrations in the city of Chemnitz two weeks ago, which were triggered by the death of German-Cuban man Daniel Hillig and the subsequent arrest of an Iraqi and a Syrian man and which saw hundreds calling for foreigners to leave Germany.

Fearing a similar escalation of violence, Koethen Mayor Bernd Hauschild warned against attending the march and advised local citizens to mourn the man's death at a commemorative event earlier in the afternoon.

Explaining his advice, Hauschild wrote in a Facebook post Sunday afternoon that he had "been informed that violent groups from outside Koethen will travel in large numbers" to attend.

State Interior Minister Holger Stahlknecht said Monday that between 400 and 500 of the 2,500 demonstrators were members of the "right-wing scene."

Local police said Sunday that the 18- and 22-year-old suspects, both from Afghanistan, were being held on suspicion of causing bodily harm with fatal consequences.

But speaking Monday , Sachsen-Anhalt state Justice Minister Anne-Marie Keding confirmed media reports that the victim suffered from heart disease and died of a heart attack, adding that "fatal injuries could not be detected."

People with lighters are pictured after the "funeral march" in Koethen on Sunday.

David Koeckert, a leading figure in far-right group Thuegida and former member of the NPD, a right-wing extremist party, was one of those who traveled to Koethen following multiple calls to action across social media.

Hundreds listened to Koeckert's speech at the event, many clapping and cheering as he described immigration to Germany as an "invasion" and warned of the "slaughter of the German people."

"This is war and can be described as such. A race war against the German people," Koeckert said. "Do you want to remain bleating sheep or do you want to become wolves and shred them?"

People light candles at the crime scene in Koethen where a 22-year-old man was found severely injured late Saturday.

In an echo of Nazi propaganda, Koeckert urged the crowds to fight back against the growth of non-white populations across the world. White people "are now a minority," he said. "But a minority who has a fist and will fight back."

State police said Monday that some speeches given at the event Sunday are being investigated for possible criminality. They did not specify whether Koeckert's speech is among them.

In footage posted by Le Monde journalist Thomas Wieder, protesters were seen marching through Koethen, calling for the return of National Socialism, and chanting, "We are the people," a phrase used 30 years ago to call for the reunification of East and West Germany, but now frequently heard at far-right gatherings to express anti-immigrant sentiment.

The demonstration came just two weeks after thousands gathered in Chemnitz, 100 miles to the south of Koethen, to protest against immigration after the death of Daniel Hillig.

The protests reignited a debate in Germany that had been simmering since 2015, regarding the integration of hundreds of thousands of refugees, the reliability of the government body tasked with assessing asylum requests and the possibility of deporting asylum seekers with a history of criminality.
__label__world (CNN) All crimes are not alike, nor are all criminals.

I grew up during the era of Joel Rifkin, the notorious New York serial killer who brutally murdered 17 women.

It was 25 years ago that Rifkin, then 34 years old, confessed to his crimes after a routine traffic stop in June 1993.

The smell of a decaying body in Rifkin's truck gave the police officers pause. Soon enough, Rifkin told authorities the horrific details: he preyed on women, and would have sex with them before strangling them and dumping their bodies.

Body parts were dumped in waterways, in woods, in oil drums -- even kept at his mother's house. To this day, Rifkin, 59, remains one of New York's most lethal criminals.

Cases like Rifkin's have stuck with me, leaving me to question how such a thing could occur. What makes someone who looks and acts like the rest of us most of the time, suddenly turn into a monster?

That's the question I'm asking in my new HLN Original Series, "Inside Evil," which seeks to expose the nature of the dangerous mind.

Serial killers like Rifkin are a unique breed of perverse amorality: they often don't process and feel like normal people. Their rationales for action often miss basic human considerations, and yet they are able to function without detection in most facets of life.

This duality is at the core of what "Inside Evil" explores -- and it's a dichotomy that forensic psychologists have examined for years.

One question that often comes up when talking about criminality of this level is the nature vs. nurture debate: is it in the criminal's nature to behave this way, or did something happen in their environment to cause this behavior?

From my work on the series, I believe the answer is almost always both. How you're raised or not raised, what life situation stressors you find yourself in -- these are fundamental in the shaping of a person.

However, there are also innate characteristics that can make someone uniquely vulnerable or invulnerable; extreme family traits or circumstances that explain the deviance.

Ultimately, I think nurture can trigger what is in your nature.

In the case of Rifkin -- who, as a serial strangler, employed a uniquely violent way to kill -- he actually doesn't understand why he does what he does. I sat inches away from him, interviewing him to try to get a glimpse into the way his mind works -- and in the end, he didn't know what compelled him to behave this way. When someone doesn't know why they do horrible and deliberate acts -- that's scary.

Because criminals often ignore how their actions affect others, it was important that "Inside Evil" not focus only on perpetrators of violence, but also the survivors.

Through their stories we not only see the wrong that was done, but also true heroism and perseverance that would crush most of us.

The biggest lesson I learned during the making of "Inside Evil" is just because somebody looks and acts like you most of the time, does not mean they are like you.

There is evil in this world -- and it is of our own making. The scariest part is that sometimes people don't even know that someone in their midst, who may even be a friend or a lover or a partner, is a monster.

(CNN) April 20 is a day of celebration for marijuana enthusiasts. The origin of 420 dates back to the early 1970s, when 4:20 p.m. marked the time that high school students in Marin County, just north of San Francisco, would regularly meet to consume marijuana. As people across the United States light up to mark the occasion, it is important to reflect on the ongoing legacy of marijuana criminalization and its widespread impact on black and brown communities.

Marijuana prohibition started in the 1920s at the state and local level in the southwestern United States. Despite widespread use by white people, both then and now, prohibition was driven by xenophobia and racism toward Mexican immigrants working as farmworkers. The term "marijuana" came into use as anti-cannabis factions sought to associate the substance with Mexicans, who by the early 1920s were caricatured as using marijuana to gain superhuman strength to commit acts of violence.

By the 1930s, Harry Anslinger , the godfather of modern drug prohibition, connected marijuana use to black jazz musicians and campaigned to prohibit marijuana nationally. He succeeded in 1937 with the passage of the Marijuana Tax Act. This racist attitude carried over to the modern-day war on drugs, first declared by Richard Nixon in 1971. John Ehrlichman, one of Nixon's former chief aids, confirmed that the drug war was intended to marginalize anti-war protesters and black people. Nixon achieved his goal using drug war tactics to target black communities.

According to a 2013 study from the ACLU, a black person in the United States is nearly four times more likely than a white person to be arrested for marijuana possession, despite similar rates of use.

Today, support for marijuana legalization is at an all-time high , with nearly two-thirds of the public now in favor. Nine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized marijuana for adult use, and many more states like New Jersey, New York and New Mexico could join them in the coming years. And a new report suggests the cognitive impairments associated with marijuana use in young people have been overstated and any potential impacts are not detectible after 72 hours of abstinence.

Just last Friday, Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado announced that he has persuaded President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, to protect states with legal marijuana from federal interference.

The evidence is clear that marijuana legalization is working. States that have legalized are experiencing dramatic declines in marijuana arrests, preventing thousands of people each year from entering the criminal justice system for conduct that a majority of Americans think should be legal. At the same time, these states are filling their coffers with millions of dollars in new tax revenues.

Even though we've made enormous progress since the "reefer madness" days of the 1930s, we shouldn't pat ourselves on the back just yet. We still have a long way to go. We must learn from the racist animus that first led to marijuana prohibition in the United States and from the racially biased manner in which marijuana prohibition has been enforced.

The question is increasingly no longer whether to legalize marijuana, but rather how. Going forward, it is imperative that we write legalization laws -- and amend laws in states that have already legalized -- that are designed to repair these harms. This includes provisions that remove past marijuana convictions from criminal records, invest marijuana tax revenues in the communities most harmed by the war on drugs, and ensure an equitable marijuana market.

Join us on Twitter and Facebook

Some states are doing just this. In California and Oregon , thousands of people can now reduce or clear past marijuana convictions. This protects people from the devastating consequences of a criminal conviction, including barriers to employment, education, housing, and public benefits. California and Massachusetts are also reinvesting marijuana tax revenues in the communities most harmed by the drug war.

So, this 420, look beyond just legalizing it. Marijuana legalization isn't -- and shouldn't be -- simply about greater access to marijuana. We must center the people who have been most harmed by decades of racialized drug policies. If we don't, marijuana legalization won't fulfill its potential to repair the devastation that mass criminalization has wrought on black and brown communities.
__label__world (CNN) They stand among the ramshackle surroundings of their new lives, staring intently into the camera. For a handful of the estimated 700,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled across the border from Myanmar to overcrowded, under-resourced refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh, this is a rare chance to tell their stories.

Dispassionately and with a matter-of-fact delivery at odds with their testimony, they recount what they say are the horrors that have led to their present situation.

One man, Mawaha Nurul Kamal, holds up a list of people from his village he says were killed by the Myanmar military, and how they died. It is a thick sheaf of pages. As the village imam, he says it was his responsibility to keep the record.

Another, Ammad Hossan, says that he witnessed the murder of one- and two-month-old infants.

Myanmar's military has repeatedly denied that it has deliberately attacked unarmed Rohingya -- despite a senior UN official saying the crisis has the "hallmarks" of genocide . Instead, the authorities insist that it only targets Rohingya militants, mostly from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgent group, that have launched deadly attacks on police posts.

"There is no evidence that Myanmar soldiers committed any human rights violations in their response to the ARSA terrorist attacks of 2017," Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay told CNN earlier in August.

"We have recently formed a new independent commission, which will investigate alleged rights abuses in Rakhine State including rape. We will treat any case in accordance with the rule of law."

Morizan claims that the Myanmar military would harass her community with constant demands for money. If any of her children wanted to get married, the soldiers would demand large fines, she says.

'Who's talking with them?'

For Karen Jungblut, Director of Global Initiatives at the Shoah Foundation, who has conducted several of the Rohingya interviews, it is important that Rohingya are given an opportunity to tell their own stories in their own words.

"Everybody's talking about them, but who's talking with them? How do we make sure that they are part of the conversation?" she says.

Around 100 interviews have so far been conducted, part of a sprawling initiative by the USC Shoah Foundation

The project has previously recorded oral accounts from Holocaust survivors, as well as testimonies from the 1994 Rwandan Tutsi Genocide, the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, the Armenian Genocide and the Guatemalan Genocide, and now its eye has turned to eastern Bangladesh on the one-year anniversary of this -- the latest, and one of the largest -- flights of humanity from persecution.

Among the tales of murder and rape are vignettes of the humiliations that many Rohingya say they have had to endure.

One man holds up registration photos he says were taken by the military -- they rounded us up and put signs around our neck like cattle, he says. The families themselves were forced to pay a fee for the photograph, and fined if there were any new additions, or anyone missing. A fine of 15,000 kyat (around $10) was levied if there was a death in the family, he says.

Jamela Khatoun, a mother of 10, alleges that her children were denied an education because of their ethnicity and religion. Still, though, she says she yearns to return to the place that the Rohingya insist is their rightful homeland.

"We would be happy to if we were able to live in Myanmar as citizens."

Personal insight

That refugees are able to tell their stories, in their own words, is of paramount importance, argues the foundation's director, Stephen Smith.

"Testimonies provide personal insight that are not possible to appreciate from documents or new reporting. They allow the individual to explain what happened ... providing agency at a time when their lives have been stripped of the right to their own personal independence," he says.

The importance of audio-visual testimony is also essential to understanding the often subtle, insidious nature of genocide, which often only receives media coverage at the point of "its most vicious climax," he says.

"Genocide and crimes against humanity often only appear in the public eye when it becomes lethal. However, the initial impact is rarely lethal. Genocide is a long slow process which results in mass murder.

"When collected en masse, testimonies provide a collective voice and enough historical data to support other sources in a quest for what happened."

Record of the past

Oral testimonies are of particular significance when it comes to the Rohingya -- with all official communications in Rakhine State historically recorded solely in Myanmar's official language of Burmese, there is no standardized written form of the 200-year-old dialect that the Rohingya speak.

"Education and literacy rates are very low among Rohingya communities," says Jungblut. "It's an oral/verbal language. So oral history and verbal communication is extremely important."

Conducting the interviews is challenging, she admits. When your job is to listen to hours of suffering, "it's a difficult place to be in. You leave and you want to scream to the world, how can we be complacent about this?" she says.

But they are potentially valuable markers -- a way for the witnesses to finally tell the story of their community's oppression, in their own language.

Their details, Smith says, could hopefully provide scholars and investigators with source material to determine the nature and specificity of alleged wrongdoing.

"When the killing stops, genocide is not over. The traumatic impact of genocide continues on in the lives of those who survived."
__label__world (CNN) The wives of the two Reuters journalists sentenced to seven years in prison in Myanmar have made a public appeal to the country's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi to help reunite their families, amid international condemnation of the government's treatment of the two men.

Speaking at a press conference in Yangon Tuesday, Chit Su Win, the wife of the reporter Kyaw Soe Oo, broke down in tears as she insisted her husband was innocent.

She said the two men "were just doing their jobs as reporters," and that her husband "was a good citizen who hadn't committed any wrongdoing."

Kyaw Soe Oo, 28 and Wa Lone, 32, were sentenced to seven years with hard labor on Monday after they were found guilty of breaking the Official Secrets Act while investigating a massacre of Rohingya Muslims.

Addressing Suu Kyi directly, Wa Lone's wife, Pan Ei Mon, said that she felt let down by the Nobel laureate.

The Syrian dictator, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, is responsible for the deaths of more than 500,000 people. UNICEF believes that a full quarter of civilian deaths have been children and minors.

Many Americans probably think that the war in Syria is over. That is, if they think about the war in Syria at all. But that is far from the case.

Over the past few months, the Syrian government has been rapidly issuing death notices for political detainees, which confirm that many of the war's earliest detainees have been dead for years

Imagine the agony of families who have lived (if they have survived at all) for years believing their brothers, husbands, fathers or daughters might still be coming home, only to learn they've been long dead.

The flurry of death notices from a usually tight-lipped government also sends an implied message to two audiences. Internally, it indicates to Assad's own people that resistance is futile. As the Washington Post noted , it signals "that it is time to move on while underscoring in grim fashion that he is firmly in control."

But externally, this is a show of Assad's confidence that releasing previously undisclosed death tolls -- possibly tens of thousands of people -- will provoke little reaction from the rest of the world.

As devastating a humanitarian crisis as the Syrian war has been, resulting in not only a genocide of half a million people but also in the displacement of millions more, it seems the Assad regime isn't quite done. The worst might be yet to come.

The province is currently home to nearly three million people , many of whom have escaped other besieged territories. The coming campaign in Idlib could be among the worst yet, prompting the United Nations to warn this month of a potential " civilian bloodbath " that could send 700,000 Syrians across dangerous borders or into the unforgiving grip of the Assad regime.

If the 2016 Aleppo massacre — in which the Assad regime's assault claimed hundreds of civilian lives — was bad, this could be significantly worse.

It's not just because it will likely lead to untold numbers of casualties of innocent civilians, including children, though that's awful enough. It's because it will also result in a new refugee crisis in Europe and bordering states, already over-extended as a result of nearly eight years of Syrian diaspora.

There is also precedent for Assad's head fake. He trumpeted a " turning point " in the war back in April of 2014, praising his army's achievements.

The following year, a refugee boy named Aylan Kurdi washed up on a beach in Turkey, symbolizing what authorities called the worst European refugee crisis since World War II. And one year after that, the months-long slaughter in Aleppo.

Now Assad seems to be sending the message that he's won the war again. We shouldn't believe him.

He's presumably hoping no one will notice that the death toll continues to rise. But President Trump, who has repeatedly called for safe zones in Syria and has taken measured action against Assad's brutal chemical weapons attacks, should. And he should call for Assad to stand down on his Idlib offensive, not just for the safety of Syrian civilians but for all of Europe.

President Trump should also reconsider his stated desire to withdraw from Syria until Syrians have reached a political solution and ISIS is completely eradicated from the country. Pulling troops out any sooner would be dangerously premature.

Congress, too, must notice the ongoing devastation. In 2017 Democrats and Republicans introduced a bill called the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act that would impose new sanctions on Assad and his backers. It would also add support for the prosecution of war crimes over the course of this crisis. It passed the House unanimously and now it's time for the Senate to pass it and the President to sign it.

Similarly, we, like so many others, are deeply troubled by President Trump's cancellation of more than $200 million in Syrian stabilization funds last week. Such funds are an important tool to complete the work of our armed service members who have fought ISIS alongside local partners.

ISIS has shown that it is capable of surviving defeats on the battlefield by breaking up into cells, melting into the population, and feeding on instability. Support for Syrian stabilization efforts is a low-cost method of denying ISIS part of its ability to regroup.

Estimates for the cost of rebuilding war-torn Syria are upwards of $200 billion.

It's in everyone's interest to make Syria livable again for its millions of displaced families. But it should come with strings attached. The No Assistance for Assad Act, which the House passed in April, would deny Assad any of these reconstruction funds unless specific conditions, many involving the protection of human rights, are met.

With important and competing news breaking in our own backyards, it's easy to see why Americans may have forgotten about the crisis in Syria. But Assad has not and, make no mistake, he isn't done slaughtering his own people yet. It's too late to save the 500,000 who have already lost their lives, but it's not too late to stop the coming offensive in Idlib, which will, by all estimates, be horrific.

Assad is hoping we don't care. We must prove him wrong.

__label__world Moscow (CNN) The crew of the Saratov Airlines flight that crashed near Moscow on Sunday didn't report any problems before the plane crashed into snowy terrain, killing all 71 people on board, state-run media said.

The Antonov An-148 aircraft was carrying 65 passengers and six crew members, the Russian news agency Interfax said. The passengers included three children, ages 5, 13 and 17, state news agency RIA reported.

Debris was found about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport on Sunday.

The plane was headed to the Russian city of Orsk, near the border with Kazakhstan. But it disappeared from radar shortly after takeoff from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport, Russian state news agency Tass reported.

The plane went down in Ramenskoye District, in the Moscow region, the Russian emergency ministry told CNN.

"The snow is very dense ... the Moscow region has had some of its heaviest snowfall in decades," CNN's Matthew Chance reported from Moscow. "It's not clear at this stage whether weather was factor in this crash."

__label__world Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) "The revolution will continue," the man shouted into the camera, "it will continue until our demands are met!"

On Friday morning, the protests in Basra continued. The day was young, and it was already a scalding 43 degrees centigrade (109 degrees Fahrenheit). By the afternoon it was even hotter. The protests usually pick up after sunset, when the temperatures drop -- ever so slightly.

All this week Basra, Iraq's third-largest city, has been wracked by protests over the decrepit state of public services. The municipal water supply is contaminated by salt water, sending thousands to the hospital in recent months, while long power cuts continue, at a time when daytime temperatures regularly reach 50 degrees centigrade (122 Fahrenheit).

Added to these immediate, in-your-face discomforts are perennial unemployment and that constant of contemporary Iraq, rampant corruption.

It shouldn't be like that. Southern Iraq sits atop around 80% of Iraq's proven oil reserves, and contains the country's only deep-water port, Um Qasr. Much of the country's wealth comes from the Basra area, but doesn't stay there.

Iraqi women demonstrate against the government and the lack of basic services on Friday in Basra.

Fall from grace

Basra, sitting on the Shatt Al-Arab waterway, was once known as the "Venice of the East" because of its system of canals, canals now brimming with rubbish. Not long ago it was a prosperous, ethnically diverse, sophisticated trading city, its hinterland producing world-famous dates.

Basra's decline began in the early 1980s with the Iran-Iraq war, when frequent Iranian shelling forced hundreds of thousands to flee, followed by the lean years of the US-imposed international sanctions.

I visited the city several times during the 1990s, and it barely showed signs of recovery. It was a sad, dirty, decaying place, with many of the buildings still damaged. Outside Basra stood the stark trunks of hundreds of decapitated date palms, their tops lopped off by the shelling.

In recent years Iraq's resources have been focused on the war against ISIS. The government was happy to take recruits from southern Iraq and send them to the front, but had little time or energy for Basra.

While Basra burns, Baghdad is gripped by political paralysis following an inconclusive election in May. The various political forces have been haggling over the spoils and are still far from deciding on the makeup of the new government.

Iraqi protesters break into an official building amid demonstrations this week.

In July caretaker Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi promised billions of dollars to upgrade Basra's services after an earlier outbreak of protests. That was two months ago, and promises remain just promises.

The real winner from the current unrest may be Muqtada al-Sadr , the Shia cleric who has emerged as a blistering critic of corruption.

Protesting the elite's excesses

Al-Sadr, not long ago an implacable foe of the US-led occupation, in 2016 inspired a spate of mass anti-corruption marches on Baghdad's so-called Green Zone, a 10-square-kilometer fortified forbidden zone containing the Iraqi parliament, ministries, embassies and the sumptuous villas of Iraqi leaders.

The Baghdad marches, which saw protesters occupy the parliament, were inspired by the same grievances that have spurred on the unrest in Basra. While Baghdad suffered -- and continues to suffer -- from prolonged power cuts, deteriorating public services and a stagnant economy, the inhabitants of the Green Zone lived -- and continue to live -- in isolated splendor behind high walls.

Iraqi Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr attends a meeting in June.

Al-Sadr has capitalized on the deep resentment against the excesses of Iraq's political class, and Basra is a golden opportunity.

In a pointed tweet addressed to Abadi, al-Sadr said: "I hope you don't think that the Basra revolutionaries are just a bubble ... quickly release Basra's money and give it to clean hands to start at once with immediate and future development projects. And beware of complacency and negligence."

The tweet aside, al-Sadr has agreed to unite his Sairoun electoral list with Abadi's Nasr list in the hopes of forming a workable government. Via Basra's revolt, he may be reminding Abadi that, even though the latter is expected to sit in the prime minister's chair, al-Sadr has the street.

While protesters have torched almost every other political party or militia office in Basra, al-Sadr's Saraya As-Salam militia offices have been spared.

Residents in the country's oil-rich south feel neglected by Baghdad despite promises to address issues surrounding basic services and high unemployment.

Above and beyond domestic politics, unrest in Basra could have an immediate impact on global oil prices. Iraq has the world's second-largest proven oil reserves, and the production from the area around Basra makes up, according to some estimates, as much as 4% of world oil production.

Already, angry Basra residents have protested outside oil company facilities demanding jobs, and others have blocked the road to the port of Um Qasr.

The danger of disruption to Iraq's oil exports comes at a time when the Trump administration is hell-bent on crippling Iran's ability to export oil as it imposes sanctions after pulling out of the nuclear deal.

As distant and disconnected as a man shouting about revolution in a city far, far away might seem, it's much closer than you might think.
__label__world (CNN) The number of orangutans on the island of Borneo has more than halved in 16 years, as hunting of the critically endangered species continues and rampant deforestation destroys its habitat, scientists say.

An article published in Current Biology found the population had declined by more than 148,000 between 1999 and 2015, leaving an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 on the Southeast Asian island.

The study projected a further drop of 45,000 from deforestation alone by 2050 if nothing changes, in a grim forecast for the great ape's future.

Orangutans exist on only two islands -- Sumatra in Indonesia and Borneo, which is shared by Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.

Indonesia and Malaysia have for decades struggled to curb deforestation and illegal logging, losing swaths of tropical forest to palm oil and paper plantations, as well as mining, destroying crucial orangutan habitat.

__label__world (CNN) Year after year, the United States beats out much larger countries -- India, China -- and more totalitarian ones --Russia and the Philippines -- for the distinction of having the highest incarceration rate in the world .

If the US prison population were a city, it would be among the country's 10 largest . More people are behind bars in America than there are living in major cities such as Philadelphia or Dallas.

But after decades of explosive growth, there are signs that the country is turning the corner on mass incarceration.

Clearly, this issue is complicated.

To better understand who the system impacts, it requires looking beyond the big numbers. Here are five key facts that bring the scope of the criminal justice system into focus.

Most inmates are held in state prisons and local jails -- not federal prisons.

JUST WATCHED One missed payment put him back behind bars Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH One missed payment put him back behind bars 01:29

Prison reform solutions often focus on the federal government, but the vast majority of incarcerated people are held in facilities controlled by state and local governments , according to the Prison Policy Initiative.

The nonpartisan think tank found that more than 1.3 million people are held in state prisons, while more than 600,000 people behind bars are in one of the country's 3,000+ local jails

These jails -- sometimes dubbed the "front door" of the criminal justice system -- often hold people who haven't yet been convicted of a crime.

In many cities and states, money often decides who stays in jail and who gets out.

JUST WATCHED She's in jail for 6 months over $545 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH She's in jail for 6 months over $545 01:21

So why were they behind bars?

Many who are arrested and go to jail are able to get out quickly by simply posting bail. But those who can't afford it are essentially trapped -- they either sit in jail until the court takes action, or work with a bail bond agent to secure their freedom (with the latter option often saddling them with debt).

Advocates will quickly point out how this system puts the poor at a huge disadvantage. Stuck in jail because they can't afford to pay bail, inmates are unable to work or support their families, making them particularly susceptible to the spiral of debt and incarceration.

The bail bond business, as with others tied to the criminal justice system, is extremely lucrative, bringing in more than $2 billion in profit each year , according to a 2017 report by nonprofit civil rights advocacy group Color of Change and the ACLU's Campaign for Smart Justice.

The 'war on drugs' isn't solely to blame for mass incarceration.

Nearly half of all inmates in federal prisons are held on drug charges, but drug offenders make up a smaller proportion of the population in state prisons and jails.

And while this rings true in many federal prisons -- where nearly half of all inmates are locked up for drug charges , often serving lengthy sentences -- it's a different story in state prisons and local jails.

But this still oversimplifies the relationship between drugs and mass incarceration.

For one, there is huge variation from state-to-state in how drug policies are enforced , according to a Pew analysis. States like Louisiana and Oklahoma, for instance, lock up drug offenders at rates far exceeding most others.

Though drugs may not be the primary reason most people are in state and local prisons, law enforcement agencies around the country are still making drug arrests in huge numbers.

In 2016, drug arrests actually increased about 10% from the previous year to more than 1.25 million, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report

Once you're in the criminal justice system, it's often difficult to get out.

Corde, who is featured in CNN Films 'American Jail,' spent time in jail for a DUI. After he was released, he was rearrested for missing one payment.

For some, just one arrest is enough to get caught up in the system.

There have been several studies on recidivism, but one of the most extensive was released in 2016 by the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC), which tracked more than 25,000 federal offenders over an eight-year period.

Officials reported that nearly half of those monitored were rearrested for a new crime or for a violation of supervision conditions. And for about half, it took less than two years for them to run afoul of the law again.

Other studies have found correlations between the length of a person's rap sheet and the likelihood of recidivism.

Minorities are still overrepresented in the prison population, but racial and ethnic gaps are shrinking.

African Americans still make up a disproportionate amount of those behind bars.

It has been a defining characteristic of the criminal justice system for years, and it's still the case today: compared to the racial makeup of the overall US population, African-Americans continue to make up a disproportionate amount of the prison population. (Nonprofit organizations such as The Vera Institute have written extensively about this issue .)

Though African-Americans comprise only about 12% of the total US population, they represent 33 percent of the federal and state prison population . That's compared to whites, who constitute 64% of American adults but just 30% of those behind bars, according to a Pew Research analysis of Bureau of Justice Statistics data.

But as the overall incarcerated population has slowly retreated from its peak in 2009, a shift is happening in American prisons: the disparity between the number of African-Americans and whites locked up is shrinking.
__label__world Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) North Korea staged a military parade Sunday to mark the 70th anniversary of the country's founding, but held back on showcasing its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), believed to be capable of targeting the United States.

The parade, which was considerably understated compared to previous years, comes against a background of stalled diplomatic talks with the US over the issue of denuclearization.

Soldiers salute as they ride tanks during a military parade and mass rally in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square on Sunday.

Experts speculated before the event that North Korea may choose not to display the country's more advanced weaponry to avoid antagonizing US President Donald Trump.

The celebration saw dozens of military vehicles and goose-stepping soldiers parade past leader Kim Jong Un in the center of the capital, Pyongyang, as cheering crowds watched on.

Airplanes forming the number 70 fly in formation and fire flares during the parade.

Kim reviewed the procession from a balcony in Kim Il Sung Square, alongside other senior officials, including Li Zhanshu, a special envoy sent by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Kim and Li locked hands and raised arms at the end of the event.

The parade was split into two sections, civilian and military. The military portion featured thousands of soldiers wearing uniforms from different periods of North Korea's history, dating back from 1948 through to the present day.

The parade is the first show of military might in North Korea since Kim and Trump met in Singapore in June.

Though some of the artillery pieces on display featured anti-American slogans as in previous years, the theme of the parade appeared overwhelmingly focused on economic development and improving the lives of the North Korean people.

North Koreans celebrate the country's 70th anniversary.

In a break from recent tradition, Kim did not speak at the event. The country's ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong Nam, addressed the audience, telling soldiers to prepare simultaneously to fight a war but also be ready to battle for economic development.

"Compared to past parades they really pulled back on displaying missile systems," said Dave Schmerler, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.

Kim has made 2018 a year of diplomacy, personally meeting with the leaders of China, South Korea and the United States for the first time since taking the reins of his country in 2011. Later this month, Kim will host South Korean President Moon Jae-in for a summit in Pyongyang, another event that could factor into the theme of Sunday's festivities.

North Koreans march in Kim Il Sung Square as part of Sunday's civilian parade.

But negotiations between North Korea and the United States over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs appear to have hit an impasse.

A little more than a month after Trump and Kim's historic summit in Singapore, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told US lawmakers Pyongyang had shown little indication that it was moving toward denuclearization. That was followed by Pompeo canceling a planned trip to North Korea in August, citing insufficient progress on the part of North Korea.

In the run up to Sunday's parade, both Washington and Pyongyang struck more of an upbeat note. South Korean officials who met with Kim last week said they were told by the young North Korean leader that he has "unwavering trust for President Trump."

Trump responded by tweeting a thank you to Kim and declaring "we will get it done together!"

On Saturday, the US State Department said that Pompeo has received a letter from Kim for Trump, which the US President believes will be positive in tone.

Experts, however, caution against reading too much into any sense of optimism.

A soldier is seen during celebrations for North Korea's 70th anniversary.

"The United States should not forget about North Korea's arsenal simply because it's kept out of sight," said Adam Mount, director of the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American Scientists.

"Even as talks have ground to a halt, every indication is that research and development of nuclear capable systems is continuing."

North Korea analysts are closely watching this weekend's festivities, as Pyongyang is known to use mass events like these to convey its policy priorities and future intentions to average North Koreans and the rest of the world.

Journalists were invited to a concert Saturday night to kick off the celebration, an event dominated by songs and performances lionizing North Korea's history. There was no mention of missiles or nuclear weapons.

Kim's bodyguards appeared to show up at the event, but there was no sign of the young leader himself. Footage from North Korean state television appeared to show Kim greeting the Russian delegation Saturday night.

In this photo provided Sunday by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center, visits the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, North Korea. Independent journalists were not given access to cover the event depicted in this image distributed by the North Korean government.

Sunday's parade was kept under wraps until it was completed, with visiting journalists invited to the event prohibited from bringing phones or live broadcasting equipment to the procession.

It's unclear why North Korea chose to bar reporters from broadcasting live from the event, though the delay allows Pyongyang's propaganda officials to better control the images coming from the parade. Experts also believe it could be a security measure.

Pyongyang is also expected to host a revival of the highly choreographed performance known as the Mass Games for the first time in five years.

Performers take part in Saturday's concert.

It's not known when exactly the Games are due to take place, as North Korea did not provide visiting journalists with a schedule of events

But the event is one of North Korea's most well-known spectacles and typically involves up to 100,000 performers dancing and performing gymnastics together in unison. It's a grandiose mix of performance art and North Korean propaganda which reflect the country's socialist values.

You failed us.

It's your responsibility to protect the youth.

But when faced with the choice of fossil fuel money for your campaigns, or the wellbeing of your children, you pick fossil fuels.

Today is Earth Day. Please save your phony Earth Day tweets and Facebook posts, I don't want to see them. Put those in a bag along with your toothless "thoughts and prayers" tweets for hurricane victims and dump them in the ocean just like you permit corporations to dump their waste.

Because my generation is so done with your talk.

I'm a 16-year-old sophomore in high school. I have my whole life ahead of me, and there's so much I want to do.

I want to travel the world and see all its natural wonders. I want to run for office so I can be the leader I always wished I had.

But I have to come to terms with the fact that all of the above very well may not happen: because I'm growing up in the early 21st century, a time when the world and all its life systems are falling apart. Climate change has loomed over my every life decision, every time I try to plan for the future.

Activtst Jamie Margolin

When I think of the future, I can't assume stability or safety. When I think of adulthood, I see my home being flooded, I see deathly heat waves, droughts, famine and intense, deadly storms.

I see insects, allergens, and diseases spreading to places where they shouldn't naturally be. I see countless people dying from toxic drinking water, food full of chemicals, and air thick with pollutants. I see millions upon millions of refugees fleeing homes in regions that have become uninhabitable. I see wars and conflict over dwindling resources.

A life full of 'ifs'

There's never been a time in my life when the scientific consensus was not that humans were changing the earth's climate.

My life, and that of my entire generation, is full of "ifs."

I want to see all the world's natural wonders -- if those natural wonders will still be around when I'm an adult.

I want to serve in political office -- if our democracy will still be intact. Because when climate-caused natural disasters, drought, food shortages, and epidemics ravage our country, authoritarians could take advantage of the crisis situation and strip away our rights.

You are leaving my generation with a world that is unlivable.

Every time you take a donation of fossil fuel money, undo environmental regulations, side with polluters, or approve new fossil fuel infrastructure, you are ensuring that your children's lives are full of "ifs."

You have the power to save your kids. You have the power to tackle the defining issue of our time head on. But you've chosen not to. The first step to getting out of a hole is to stop digging, and you can't even manage to do that. You're still in the pockets of corporations digging our destruction.

Leaders: I want you to know that Generation Z has had it.

Late last summer, after the string of climate-worsened natural disasters, I founded a youth climate action movement, Zero Hour.

We're called Zero Hour to remind people that now is the time to act on climate change. We are youth from all over the country, who like the stereotypical Gen-Z's that we are, work over the internet.

Youth climate action

We are organizing the Youth Climate Weekend in Washington DC this July that you won't be able to ignore.

On July 19, for the Youth Climate Lobby Day we are going to your offices on Capitol Hill to remind you who you are working for.

On July 20, through art builds and artful activism, youth will remind you of the beauty of the planet you should be fighting to protect.

On July 21, for the Youth Climate March we will be flooding the streets because #ThisIsZeroHour and if you won't pay attention to Mother Nature's cries for help, maybe you'll pay attention to the cries of your children.

And if you don't listen to us this summer, we will keep escalating action.

Prepare to see us in your offices more and more often. Prepare to be voted out.

Leaders, I want you to know that the youth are watching.

See you this July.

__label__world (CNN) Three men walk into a room: a dictator, an autocrat, and an ayatollah. A fourth man asks them each for a meeting.

The dictator is desperate, grabs it and bags the benefits. The autocrat smiles and sits smugly through it. The ayatollah doesn't answer.

This will be President Trump's conundrum with Iran: whatever he does, Iran will play the long game.

Trump told the world on Monday: "I would certainly meet with Iran if they wanted to meet. I don't know that they're ready yet." That may be one of his more accurate statements of late.

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani met with the new British Ambassador to Tehran Tuesday where he announced, not for the first time, the US withdrawal from the multilateral nuclear deal in May was "illegal," adding that "the ball is in Europe's court."

It seems that Iran -- and Rouhani is the face of it right now -- is playing the pragmatist. For Iran, it's better to keep some enemies on its side rather than alienate them all at once.

After all, it wasn't the UK, Germany and France who withdrew from the six-nation Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , but the US alone.

Rather than ripping up the JCPOA and ramping up nuclear production, Iran has only talked about building up its stockpile of centrifuges for uranium enrichment that could be used to make a bomb.

Iranian officials have said it is up to the JCPOA's European signatories to make the agreement work to Iran's benefit, meaning Tehran don't suffer financially because of it.

That is in itself an implicit threat, because Trump is set to slap secondary sanctions on European businesses trading in Iran. But it's not a commitment to confrontation.

Iran is talking as much to divide its enemies as to conquer. This is what the Iranians do well. Just ask former US Secretary of State John Kerry, who negotiated the JCPOA with them. It was a long and tortuous process, with concessions only coming at the eleventh hour, partial and offered only grudgingly.

JUST WATCHED The world reacts to Trump's nuclear deal pull out Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The world reacts to Trump's nuclear deal pull out 03:30

Whereas Trump does angry and impetuous to a tee, Iran's theocratic leaders are masters in the art of the ambiguity and sleight of hand.

Where Trump wields the diplomatic equivalent of a battle ax, they excel with the subtle skill of death by a thousand cuts.

They haven't, for example, massively ratcheted up retaliation by reverting to the use of regional proxies, like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shia militias in Syria, to attack US allies and interests. This strategic restraint, outside of a few isolated incidents, is a measure of the caution with which Iran is wielding those knives.

Trump's one-on-one summits -- all style, little substance -- have been with completely different types of people.

President Vladimir Putin of Russia, like Kim Jong Un of North Korea, is not as vulnerable as Iran's leaders. Kim's economy might be hurting, but his grip on power seems rock solid and public dissent is almost unheard of.

Putin rules his roost and controls the media and the national narrative, keeping him popular and allowing him room to indulge in a little showmanship with Trump, whom he seems to find to be a US President with much potential for benefiting Russia.

In the mind of Iran's Ayatollah right now must be the saying President George W. Bush managed to mangle: "fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me."

Having agreed to destroy, ship out or mothball much of its nuclear capabilities in return for the lifting of sanctions once already at America's behest, why should Iran trust Trump, or any leader that follows him, to keep America's word?

The answer Trump is giving right now is that the Iranians have no choice: He'll cripple its economy if they don't. That said, when he stood next to Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Monday, Trump sounded almost subtle: "I do believe that they will probably end up wanting to meet ... I think it's an appropriate thing to do. If we could work something out that's meaningful, not the waste of paper that the other deal was, I would certainly be willing to meet."

And therein lies the rub: Even if the Iranians were tempted to talk -- which its lawmakers are most definitely indicating they are not -- there is little evidence that his recent summits have been anything more than glorified handshakes.

The minimalist four-point agreement with Kim is already breaking down, as the North Koreans appear to renege on what Trump said was agreed while complaining that Trump's officials are "bullying" them.

As for Putin, Trump's race to get face time with him seems to have amounted to little that he could take home to the bank.

Iran's deputy Foreign Minister, Bahram Qasemi, warns that "Washington's hostile measures against Tehran and its efforts to put economic pressure on the country and impose sanctions, there will remain no possibility of talks."

For now, it seems Trump is more likely to have a second round with Putin than he is to have a first face-to-face with Rouhani. However much the Iranians are hurting, political capital -- not just the economy -- is at stake.

Kinzinger and Boyle are the co-chairs of the Friends of a Free, Stable and Democratic Syria Caucus. The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs. Read more opinion articles at CNN.

The Syrian dictator, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, is responsible for the deaths of more than 500,000 people. UNICEF believes that a full quarter of civilian deaths have been children and minors.

Many Americans probably think that the war in Syria is over. That is, if they think about the war in Syria at all. But that is far from the case.

Over the past few months, the Syrian government has been rapidly issuing death notices for political detainees, which confirm that many of the war's earliest detainees have been dead for years

Imagine the agony of families who have lived (if they have survived at all) for years believing their brothers, husbands, fathers or daughters might still be coming home, only to learn they've been long dead.

The flurry of death notices from a usually tight-lipped government also sends an implied message to two audiences. Internally, it indicates to Assad's own people that resistance is futile. As the Washington Post noted , it signals "that it is time to move on while underscoring in grim fashion that he is firmly in control."

But externally, this is a show of Assad's confidence that releasing previously undisclosed death tolls -- possibly tens of thousands of people -- will provoke little reaction from the rest of the world.

As devastating a humanitarian crisis as the Syrian war has been, resulting in not only a genocide of half a million people but also in the displacement of millions more, it seems the Assad regime isn't quite done. The worst might be yet to come.

The province is currently home to nearly three million people , many of whom have escaped other besieged territories. The coming campaign in Idlib could be among the worst yet, prompting the United Nations to warn this month of a potential " civilian bloodbath " that could send 700,000 Syrians across dangerous borders or into the unforgiving grip of the Assad regime.

If the 2016 Aleppo massacre — in which the Assad regime's assault claimed hundreds of civilian lives — was bad, this could be significantly worse.

It's not just because it will likely lead to untold numbers of casualties of innocent civilians, including children, though that's awful enough. It's because it will also result in a new refugee crisis in Europe and bordering states, already over-extended as a result of nearly eight years of Syrian diaspora.

There is also precedent for Assad's head fake. He trumpeted a " turning point " in the war back in April of 2014, praising his army's achievements.

The following year, a refugee boy named Aylan Kurdi washed up on a beach in Turkey, symbolizing what authorities called the worst European refugee crisis since World War II. And one year after that, the months-long slaughter in Aleppo.

Now Assad seems to be sending the message that he's won the war again. We shouldn't believe him.

He's presumably hoping no one will notice that the death toll continues to rise. But President Trump, who has repeatedly called for safe zones in Syria and has taken measured action against Assad's brutal chemical weapons attacks, should. And he should call for Assad to stand down on his Idlib offensive, not just for the safety of Syrian civilians but for all of Europe.

President Trump should also reconsider his stated desire to withdraw from Syria until Syrians have reached a political solution and ISIS is completely eradicated from the country. Pulling troops out any sooner would be dangerously premature.

Congress, too, must notice the ongoing devastation. In 2017 Democrats and Republicans introduced a bill called the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act that would impose new sanctions on Assad and his backers. It would also add support for the prosecution of war crimes over the course of this crisis. It passed the House unanimously and now it's time for the Senate to pass it and the President to sign it.

Similarly, we, like so many others, are deeply troubled by President Trump's cancellation of more than $200 million in Syrian stabilization funds last week. Such funds are an important tool to complete the work of our armed service members who have fought ISIS alongside local partners.

ISIS has shown that it is capable of surviving defeats on the battlefield by breaking up into cells, melting into the population, and feeding on instability. Support for Syrian stabilization efforts is a low-cost method of denying ISIS part of its ability to regroup.

Estimates for the cost of rebuilding war-torn Syria are upwards of $200 billion.

It's in everyone's interest to make Syria livable again for its millions of displaced families. But it should come with strings attached. The No Assistance for Assad Act, which the House passed in April, would deny Assad any of these reconstruction funds unless specific conditions, many involving the protection of human rights, are met.

With important and competing news breaking in our own backyards, it's easy to see why Americans may have forgotten about the crisis in Syria. But Assad has not and, make no mistake, he isn't done slaughtering his own people yet. It's too late to save the 500,000 who have already lost their lives, but it's not too late to stop the coming offensive in Idlib, which will, by all estimates, be horrific.

Assad is hoping we don't care. We must prove him wrong.
__label__world (CNN) Tommy Frenck is the proud owner and proprietor of The Golden Lion, a traditional, half-timbered guesthouse surrounded by meadows in a small village in central Germany.

Schnitzel topped with a fried egg is the specialty here, but his patrons come for more than food and drink: they come to share what they call "patriotic" views.

"I bought the guesthouse because we could not go into the other guesthouses," says Frenck. "Every time the police or other people would kick us out: 'Don't let the right-wing in! Don't let the Nazis in!'"

Germany has seen a resurgence in far-right sentiment over the last few years, along with the rapid rise of the anti-immigration, anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD). But few embrace their political identity as flamboyantly as Frenck, whose neck is tattooed with the word "Aryan."

"I am proud of my nation. I am proud of my heritage," he says. "That's the thing in Germany: if you are proud of your heritage, you are the bad guy... Every person who's not politically correct is somehow a 'Nazi.'"

Tommy Frenck runs a guesthouse in rural Germany where he serves "Hitler schnitzels" and sells far-right merchandise.

Frenck bought the guesthouse in 2015 not just as a place for like-minded citizens but also as a warehouse for his growing business in Nazi merchandise, much of which barely skirts Germany's stringent hate speech laws.

The place is decorated with World War II memorabilia, including the German imperial flag and a row of liquors named after tank, air force and SS commanders.

On a top shelf, a wooden doll has its arm permanently raised in a Nazi salute and several cushion covers are printed with "I heart HTLR" logos.

And with the AfD surging in Germany, the pub is far from alone in spreading its message to far-right supporters, despite Germany's criminal code prohibiting the public use of "symbols of unconstitutional organizations" -- that includes the swastika, the Celtic cross, the Nazi salute and other symbols associated with the Nazi Party.

Punishment can range from fines to three years in prison. As a result, far-right supporters have developed a coded language, in which Frenck is fluent.

Among Frenck's merchandise are baseball caps, T-shirts and mugs with slogans referencing Adolf Hitler.

One T-shirt reads "88," signifying "HH" or "Heil Hitler" (H being the 8th letter of the alphabet). Every April 20 -- Adolf Hitler's birthday -- customers at the guesthouse can enjoy a "HTLR SCHNTZL" for 8.88 euros.

According to Frenck, sales of his products have grown 10% since the beginning of 2016, coinciding with the arrival of more than 1 million refugees in Germany in 2015.

And his customers are not all tattooed, middle-aged men. On the day CNN visits, a family from the southern state of Baden-Württemberg is also visiting with their primary-school-aged daughter. She picks out a pink "Little German" T-shirt and pays with her pocket money, fishing around in her purse for the right coins.

Her mother, who does not want to be named, says the family makes a point of visiting the guesthouse every year.

"We come here because this is what we think," she told CNN, "This is how we want to live."

Politics must be 'for the German people'

Frenck wants to stop immigration to Germany and ban Islam. He voted for the AfD in last year's federal elections, when the party won 12.6% of the vote nationally -- and 22.5% in Frenck's home state of Thuringia.

Echoing the party's politicians -- who now occupy 92 seats in the country's parliament -- he says he is not a white supremacist, but just doesn't like globalization and the mixing of cultures.

"Most important for me is that the German government makes politics for German people and not for the European Union or refugees in Africa," he says. "They have to be for the German people."

He points to his world map of travels, studded with pins across Asia and the Middle East.

"I love all these countries and I have friends all over the world! I like the food there. The thing is, they want to make from all these nice cultures just one culture. You know what I mean?"

Across Europe, such views are becoming more common, and those who hold them more vocal. Anti-immigration politicians in former Soviet bloc nations such as Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban -- who in February likened immigration to a "flu epidemic" -- have been joined by party leaders in countries such as Denmark, France and Austria, previously considered bastions of liberalism.

Far-right parties are gaining ground across much of the continent, and are now in power in Italy, Austria and Hungary.

"We are currently engaged in a political cultural struggle in Europe," said Hajo Funke, professor of political science at Berlin's Free University. "We have this right-wing shift in parts of (the continent)."

He believes German Chancellor Angela Merkel has resisted this shift, by refusing to form a coalition with the AfD and by defying the attempts of her interior minister to drift to the right on immigration.

Her approach "represents a middle course," he said. "And this middle course is what the majority wants."

Frenck insists his controversial products break no laws.

Far-right concerts are 'dangerous for society'

While central government may be holding a relatively steady centrist course, the impact of right-wingers such as Frenck (and his merchandise) is a big concern for some Germans.

"Superficially, some of the T-shirts try to be funny," says Stefan Herdegen, a local activist who monitors far-right extremist groups in Thuringia. "They are not funny. They are serious because they promote Nazi ideas to people. And that is dangerous."

He's also concerned about the music festivals Frenck organizes in the state each year.

"These events are dangerous, not only because there have been violent incidents reported, but because of their political nature they are dangerous for society. Neo-Nazi content is spread here."

Frenck's activities have put him on the radar of local police. The domestic intelligence service in Thuringia became especially concerned last year when Frenck organized a "Rock for Identity" music festival that attracted around 6,000 people, according to a statement sent to CNN by the domestic intelligence service in Thuringia.

Festivalgoers are seen at the music festival organized by Frenck in June 2018.

Following heavy criticism of their tactics at that event, police took a tougher approach at this year's event -- a "Day of Identity" concert in June featuring far-right heavy metal bands and guest speakers from the AfD.

Fewer than 2,500 people came, according to police, attendance dampened by rain and an overwhelming police presence that cut off road traffic to the event.

Police said they recorded 84 violations at the concert, some of which were hate speech offenses including the display of banned symbols -- but one journalist was also punched in the face by a concert-goer.

Funke is concerned that authorities have allowed Frenck too long a leash in the past and was pleased to see more police intervention at this year's concert. "But more can always be done," he said.

Frenck knows he is monitored by police but insists he has broken no laws and has no criminal record. He says that police concerns about his music festivals are overblown and that he was happy with this year's turnout.

"For me, it was a good business day. We had people from Switzerland, Norway, some Swedes, also Poland, Hungary and Russia," he says, rifling through a guestbook in which concert-goers left messages.

"We're hoping that at the next event, police will stop searching us before going in to listen to bands. It just intimidates us and keeps people from attending."

He's planning another event this summer and also has a fresh batch of designs and new products for his online business, including a set of queen-size bedsheets emblazoned with the German imperial flag.

"I am a regular guy who pays his taxes like anyone else. I am not doing anything wrong," he says. "If people label me as a Nazi it's not my problem."

__label__world New Delhi (CNN) Indian Supreme Court Justice Dipak Misra quoted Shakespeare as he read out the unanimous ruling of five judges to legalize gay sex.

"What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet," Misra said, borrowing a phrase from "Romeo and Juliet," as he overturned the colonial era Section 377.

"The said phrase, in its basic sense, conveys that what really matters is the essential qualities of the substance and the fundamental characteristics of an entity but not the name by which it or a person is called," Misra added.

Hearing the familiar words from the play set Danish Sheikh's heart racing.

Sheikh, a law professor at the Sonipat-based Jindal Global Law School, is one of many LGBT Indians who have fought for years to overturn the country's draconian anti-gay laws, inherited from the former British colonial government.

As he listened to the ruling, he said he experienced a "sense of delight ... which slowly turned to relief and headiness as they continued to read, and I absorbed just how significant this decision was."

Sheikh's political awakening came in part due to another Supreme Court ruling in 2013, which reversed a landmark ruling by the Delhi High Court that a ban on gay sex violated citizens' fundamental rights.

"After 2013, there was a lot of energetic activism in the country," he said. "The kind of outrage that was felt resonated across civil society, outside the LGBT community ... society started to tolerate, and even accept, queer persons."

For Sheikh, the issue of acceptance was one which cut far closer to home: in 2012, he had come out to his parents.

"They reacted with anger and sorrow, then took me to a psychiatrist who informed all of us that homosexuality was a mental disorder, possibly the result of a tumor in my hypothalamus, which he could cure with aggressive instant treatment," he recalled in a Facebook post. "I stormed out of the doctor's office, and their house. Something broke between us that day."

While his mother made efforts to repair their relationship, Sheikh's father didn't talk to him for years, but in July when the court began hearing the case again "he called, and in a shaking voice asked if I'd like him and my mother to come to the court, if that would help, if I might need their support at this time?"

"It took me a while to find my voice," Sheikh wrote. "Things can change."

LGBT activists celebrate after the verdict by Supreme Court of India which stuck down on the British-era section 377 of the penal code that penalized people for their sexual orientation and ordered that gay sex among consenting adults is not an offence.

'Deep joy'

Members of India's LGBT community partied late into the night Thursday, even as torrential rain fell in Delhi and elsewhere.

"Justice has finally come our way," said Edwin Thomas, a 22-year-old gay man who works in the social sector. "We've been out and front and center for a really long time. It's just that we needed the rest of society and our legal structure to catch up with us."

While the ruling was expected to strike down the law, Thomas said he and many others were nervous that it might go the other way.

Edwin Thomas was born in Dubai, but found acceptance and a community in India which enabled him to come out as gay.

Born and raised in Dubai, he moved to India at the age of 17 to go to university. While the country has a reputation as a conservative society, it was in India where Thomas came out and "found the courage to express my sexuality."

"I came to India in 2013, when they recriminalized gay sex, and five years down the line things are looking up and that gives you hope. Hope is what keeps everyone going and that's a good feeling," he said.

Like others, Thomas feels the ruling now paves the way for the start of a new Indian LGBT rights movement and as an "open avenue for newer ways of protection and justice."

Dhrubo Jyoti, a 29-year-old journalist and LGBT activist who identifies as queer, said there was a sense of "catharsis" with the new ruling for those "who were at the Supreme Court in 2013 and had their hearts broken."

"It not just affirms one's faith in the Constitution but it also means that the gloom and the despair in this atmosphere of abuse for many of us, hopefully, for a new generation of queer people, it won't be there," he said.

While Jyoti recognizes that changing prejudiced mindsets will take a long time, he emphasized that changing the law was a vital first step in building a new society where LGBT people are protected and respected.

"Without decriminalization, a further fight for rights cannot happen," he said.

Two men kiss as members of the LGBT community celebrated the Supreme Court's ruling. "The law had become a weapon for harassment for the LGBT community," Chief Justice Dipak Misra said as he announced the landmark verdict.

'Relief ... and sadness'

Prevailing attitudes against homosexuality were on show Thursday even as the ruling made gay sex legal. Indian media connected the issue to bestiality in coverage of the ruling, and even some of those celebrating were still fearful of being quoted by name as they may face prejudice for being openly LGBT.

"My first reaction was of immense relief. My second reaction was the sadness that I felt for everybody who's had to go through life thinking they're criminals. Their entire identity to be reduced to 'Oh, this person is gay or a lesbian' and suddenly that doesn't matter anymore. At least legally, that sanction now exists," said a 57-year-old man who asked not to be identified.

"It's not something one should be ashamed of but because of cultural norms, there is discrimination."

He said that while he does not overtly hide his sexuality, it is also not something he makes an effort to speak about or highlight.

"I say this with caution, social change in India takes a very long time to come," he said. "We may depend upon law to change certain aspects in the way we live but it is actually social norms, which really bring about that change, and that change is not going to come immediately."

While he has lived most his life in the shadow of discrimination, he was optimistic that those who come after him will have different experiences.

"I accept the fact that change won't come in my lifetime. What has happened is going to benefit the future generations, but I really hope to make the most of it."

Women celebrate in Kolkata. Activists said the next stage of the fight will be for full legal protections and equality for LGBT people.

As the fight now turns to the broader issues of acceptance and legal protections for gay couples -- and potentially the issue of same-sex marriage -- many in India's LGBT community are still reveling in their victory.

"This is the beginning of a new phase ... for LGBT rights but that is in the future, today is a day of celebration for us," said lawyer Arundhati Katju, who represented the petitioners at the Supreme Court. "We're celebrating the petitioners, we're celebrating our court, and ultimately our Constitution."

(CNN) Dozens of men wearing military combat uniforms and armed with automatic machine guns carried out the deadly assault on a Sufi mosque in northern Sinai, Egyptian authorities said.

Twenty-five to 30 attackers arrived in five SUVs at the al Rawdah Sufi mosque in Bir al-Abed on Friday. Some wore masks and at least one was carrying an ISIS flag, the state prosecutor told state-run Nile TV in a statement.

They positioned themselves at the building's entrances and the front of the mosque shortly before the massive gunfire and loud explosions rang out.

By the time the attackers' weapons went quiet, 305 people were dead, including 27 children, the prosecutor said Saturday. An additional 128 people were wounded.

The al Rawdah Sufi mosque is known as the birthplace of an important Sufi cleric. Sufism is a mystical branch of Islam that some jihadists consider heretical.
